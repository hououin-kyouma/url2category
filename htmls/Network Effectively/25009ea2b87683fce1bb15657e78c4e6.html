       <p>While time spent at college is a fond memory and a happy experience for most, the student life is not without its rough patches. Everyone's situation is unique, but there are a few problems that almost all college students deal with at least once during their time at school.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">1. Time Management</h2>
      <div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_1974722">
       <p><strong>Problem:</strong> College is academically challenging. For many, college courses require much more effort than high school classes did. Unlike most high schools, colleges often pack two years of content into one year. Many students take a full 15 credit semester, while others try to cram in up to 18 or even 21 credits. At times, it seems impossibe to stay on top of it all.</p> 
       <p><strong>Solution: </strong>Know your limits. If you can't handle 18 credits in one semester, it is worth it in the long run to slow down and take only 15. While the purpose of a college education is to learn as much as you can, that doesn't mean studying all the time. It is important to schedule time for fun and to take breaks to keep your mind fresh and clear. For more ways to manage this kind of academic stress, see this guide of <a href="javascript:hpLoadLink('article',282268, '', '')">effective study habits</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">2. Debt</h2>
      <div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_2055302">
       <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Tuition costs are rising at alarmingly high rates. Add to that the cost of housing, meals, supplies, transportation, and textbooks, and you have a recipe for unmanageable debt. Most financial advisors recommend borrowing no more than one expects to earn their first year out of college. However, soaring tuition costs make this rule difficult to follow. According to an article in <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/10/07/student-loan-expectations-myth-vs-reality">U.S. News</a>, almost half of today's students say that the cost is making them reconsider finishing their degree. Students are increasingly dropping out of college because they cannot afford the expense. Others are forced to juggle full academic schedules with full-time jobs to make ends meet. Graduating debt-free is almost unheard of.</p> 
       <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Student loans are relatively easy to get. Many students, however, don't know how repayment works and how many years they may spend paying off their loans. This lack of understanding only adds to the stress. An important part of your education is educating yourself about the structure of the loans you take on to pay for that education. Sit down with a financial advisor to get a firm grasp on the debt you're taking on.</p> 
       <p>Consider an on-campus job. Working on-campus will cut out potential transportation expenses and help you stay more focused academically. If you had a job in high school and are going to college locally, see if you can continue working while in school. If you are going away to school, inquire about transferring to a job location near your school. In addition, create a budget for shopping trips and eating out and stick to it.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">3. Spreading Yourself Too Thin</h2>
      <div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_2055308">
       <p><strong>Problem: </strong>To afford the high price of college tuition, many students must get jobs. Juggling a job, 15 to 18 credits, relationships, and extracurricular activities is extremely difficult. Many students try to cram all of these activities into one day and do not get enough sleep. Without proper rest, students are vulnerable to physical and mental health problems.</p> 
       <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Decide what is important. Prioritize and schedule events, games, meetings, social events, and studies accordingly. Also, be aware of your options when getting a job. Universities often offer jobs that fit into a student's schedule.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">4. Homesickness</h2>
      <div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_2055391">
       <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Whether they admit it or not, most students will at one point get homesick, especially those who attend a school that is more than three hours away from home. Freshmen suffer more, as it is presumably their first year away from home.</p> 
       <p><strong>Solution: </strong>If you live within three or four hours from home (a comfortable day's drive), plan to visit home once every month or two. Ask friends and family to email, call, and send care packages. These steps should greatly assist in reducing feelings of homesickness.</p> 
       <p>Many campuses have support groups for students. Talking to others who are having similar experiences can help. You may even form friendships with some of the people you meet there. Remember that the other students you come into contact with every day may be feeling the same things you are, and you can help each other.</p>

       <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Every problem on this list can raise a student's stress level and contribute to emotional lows. Some find temporary relief in partying which, in excess and in the long run, may contribute to depression. </p> 
       <p><strong>Solution:</strong> If stress and depression are an issue, seek professional support. Many campuses have free counseling programs for students. Counselors are trained to listen and help students get back on track. </p>

      <div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_2055394">
       <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Heightened stress, poor self-care, and lack of sleep can cause health problems. Living in close quarters also poses health risks and can increase a student's chances of contracting illnesses.</p> 
       <p><strong>Solution: </strong>Eat healthy, balanced meals. Get a good night's rest as well. Wash your hands often. If an illness does develop, visit your campus clinic.</p>

       <p><strong>Problem: </strong>If you're lucky, you'll make many new friends. Establishing connections and spending time with classmates and roommates is important for building community. However, spending too much time together can be challenging, and conflicts can arise. Social relations can become a distraction.</p> 
       <p><strong>Solution: </strong>Take some time out for yourself. If possible, get away from campus for a break and visit a coffee shop or a mall, take a walk in a neighborhood, or visit a local park. Prioritize time for studying and taking care of yourself. If conflicts do arise and you need help, get your RA or another friend involved.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle"> 8. Partying</h2>
      <div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_2055396">
       <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Partying in itself is not a problem. Parties can be a great way for students to blow off steam. However, sometimes partying can cause problems. Drugs and alcohol can lead to poor choices, risky behavior, health risks, and even potentially deadly situations. Having sex without sober consent and without taking the necessary precautions can be traumatic, dangerous, and even criminal.</p> 
       <p><strong>Solution: </strong>While parties are important, enjoy them in a responsible and legal way so you don't create problems for yourself or others. Know your limits. Ask for a ride home if you've been drinking. Keep track of your friends and make sure they're being safe, too. Make sure to eat and drink enough water when consuming alcohol. Carry a condom. Understand what it means to have "affirmative consent."</p>

      <div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_2055397">
       <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Relationships are good, but they can be overwhelming. Sometimes they take a lot of time and can begin to encroach on your education. There are times in every relationship when a couple will have a disagreement which can distract them from schoolwork and add to stress levels. Break-ups can drive some students even further into depression.</p> 
       <p><strong>Solution: </strong>Relationship advice is hard to give, since the solution varies on a case-by-case basis. Establish a clear communication of your needs and expectations from the outset. If you do break up, consult with a school counselor to work through the experience.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">10. Choosing a Major</h2>
      <div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_2055404">
       <p><strong>Problem: </strong>There is a lot of pressure to choose a major. It is easy to think that your major will determine your future career and how much money you will make, which means that making the right decision now feels hugely important (and stressful).</p> 
       <p><strong>Solution: </strong>College majors are important, but they do not chisel your future career or wages into stone. Choose something that you like. If you are unsure about what major to choose, choose something broad and versatile, such as communications. Many students who get their undergraduate degrees in one field progress to get a Master's degree in a different area. Worrying too much about your major is simply not worth it. Focus instead on gaining knowledge and life skills.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Is College Worth it All?</h2>
      <div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_2056533">
       <p>These are just ten of the major challenges that students face. In the end, is it worth facing these problems and struggles? If you ask students, eight out of ten will say it is. While college can stress you to the limit, the good times and outcomes will outweigh the bad.</p>

           <p class="">I just hate the fact that we have to study stuff that we will never ever use in our lives once we get our job. For example: my boss will never say, "Hey PJ, we just found a new oil source for our company, could you go and find the integral for a pipe we're going to use?" 89% of the materials we study is completely unnecessary.</p>

           <p class="">I am from Ecuador and I study at ESPOL. The problem I can see is the time you have to invest to study, the complexity with which my university is run and the subjects that are complicated. Manage time are one of the best solutions to this problem. And in some cases nostalgia and depression infuse but in few people.</p>

           <p class="">If you develop one of these mental health ailments –depression, anxiety.. try to remember that your friends are looking out for your best interests. They want you to be well, and they are not attacking you. Talking about your problems with someone close to you may seem like a daunting task, but try to let them help you until you are ready to seek the professional help you need to get better.</p>

           <p class="">l have been following the ten common problems faced by college students and from what l see is all the ten problems have to do with time management. Only when you manage your time effectively, students can manage their debts that is applying for loans on time.</p>
           <p class="">When you manage your time effectively its also easy to spread yourself too thin.</p>
           <p class="">Home sickness, Depression, Partying, social problems and Relationship all needs time of their own thus time management is required so that you give each and every aspects of your life a pinch of your limited time.</p>

           <p class="">Hm. I can relate to many of these.</p>
           <p class="">The point about knowing your limits is well-taken. In my case, I had a scholarship that mandated I take at least 15 credit hours per semester (a "full load") ... but I often took 19. The idea was to get through quickly so as to save money. But in terms of actual learning, of course it is better to take fewer credit hours, and spend more time studying them in-depth ... to actually learn the material rather than just being exposed to it. However, even with 19 credit hours, I could have spent more time marinading myself in the material. So much of my time I frittered away on hobbies, clubs, recreational reading.</p>
           <p class="">Regarding problems with roommates, friends, and significant others ... as you say, there's no silver bullet for these things. I do agree that taking some time away can be good for a student having roommate problems ... but it might also be good to ask ourselves, "Am I contributing to this problem, in fact might I be a large part of it?" College students are young adults, just learning to relate to others as adults, still in a lot of ways thinking like kids (if my own experience is any guide). They might encounter people who will not put up with them in the ways that their family have learned to. This is part of growing up and maturing.</p>
           <p class="">Young adulthood is also the time of life when certain health problems may come to the fore ... for example, it could be rheumatoid arthritis, migraines, bipolar disorder, depression ...</p>
           <p class="">Regarding the emphasis on "what's your major," college is not the ideal place for everyone to find or develop what they are good at. Many might do better with trade school or jumping right into a career. But perhaps that's a topic for another hub.</p>

           <p class="">Help could come to the students through peer-mentoring programs supported through one-to-one relationship between seniors and juniors. Such measures should be started by colleges to ease the pain and provide guidance by connecting them through technology.</p>

           <p class="">Another problem for students is the anxiety for the future as the jobs are not many and you fear that you don't always have the skills for them. What I do, is search for internships, competitions and other student opportunities (I find them a heysuccess.com) and apply! That way you can travel the world (some of them are even fully funded!) and learn so much more than just from a degree.</p>

           <p class="">I am now a junior college student and have had a share of some of the problems you enumerated above such as study, money, job and choosing a major. But I think the worst of all is on my studies. Just recently, we had our final exam in literature (about criticism and stylistics) and I knew that I should have studied earlier because it would really cause me a lot including my scholarships (a solution to my money problems) and consequently, my job as a student assistant in one of the offices in the university if I will fail the subject, but I just made my reading and processing of the lengthy texts on the eleventh hour. To keep me up the whole night, I took a beverage containing a high dosage of caffeine. True enough, I was able to read almost all of the texts until 3AM before finally retiring. However, when it was time for me to take the exam all I could see every time I recall the information is darkness. Completely hopeless and nearly sobbing, I submitted my answer sheet wearily with no other thing or solution in mind but a prayer that God will help me pass the subject. Just lately, when I checked my grades I found out that I did not only pass, it is also a little bit higher than the cut off grade! With it I proved to myself that God answered my prayer. My passing of the subject is not just a mere consequence, but a product of a will. I already learned my lesson from that experience of mine and I am hoping that I will not stumble upon the same mistake again by managing my time properly.</p>

           <p class="">I believe you did a great job of pointing out challenges young people face when going off to college. I grew up one of the happiest people in the world and my whole life changed when I went to college. I went to college and for the first time in my life I felt depressed. The depression caused me to also have tremendous anxiety, which in turn led me to experiment with different ways to adjust to my life in college. Those experiments led me to act in ways that were outside of who I really was as a person and I continue to pay the price to this day for those experiments - over 20 years later, and, therefore, my entire adult life.</p>
           <p class="">Society puts a lot of pressure on students with college - such as "oh - where are you going to college?" - and it so unnecessary. The things we learn in college are useless compared to teaching our children and students about how it is important to "follow our hearts" and do and go where we feel the best inside and only we know where we will feel the best. Nobody can tell us where we we need to be but we must speak up loudly about how we feel inside and if we feel depressed, to speak loudly and speak early to avoid the downward spiral that will most certainly follow from ignored depression.</p>
           <p class="">We don't teach our children and kids or even adults about what depression and anxiety are - and how dangerous it is and it destroys success and fosters failure in all aspects of our lives, including family and in our careers.</p>
           <p class="">To think that my depression started in college because I was not in the right place for me - and my whole reason for being there was to better myself for a better future, than to develop a life-long depression which only started for the very first time in college. It's unreal but it's true. This is why I applaud your hub for bringing out that depression can happen in college and how important it is to make whatever change is necessary to stop it immediately. Even if it means transferring schools or returning home for a semester or two, because depression is not normal and should never be tolerated as it can turn into a viscous life-long battle.</p>

           <p class="">It think you had a really great outline here and then became a bit lazy when filling in the article. This hub and your hub on study habits both seem this way, yet this hub is quite a bit better. Keep writing and I look forward to possible edits on these existing articles.

           <p class="">I believe you did a great job of pointing out challenges young people face when going off to college. I grew up one of the happiest people in the world and my whole life changed when I went to college. I went to college and for the first time in my life I felt depressed. The depression caused me to also have tremendous anxiety, which in turn led me to experiment with different ways to adjust to my life in college. Those experiments led me to act in ways that were outside of who I really was as a person and I continue to pay the price to this day for those experiments - over 20 years later, and, therefore, my entire adult life.</p>
           <p class="">Society puts a lot of pressure on students with college - such as "oh - where are you going to college?" - and it so unnecessary. The things we learn in college are useless compared to teaching our children and students about how it is important to "follow our hearts" and do and go where we feel the best inside and only we know where we will feel the best. Nobody can tell us where we we need to be but we must speak up loudly about how we feel inside and if we feel depressed, to speak loudly and speak early to avoid the downward spiral that will most certainly follow from ignored depression.</p>
           <p class="">We don't teach our children and kids or even adults about what depression and anxiety are - and how dangerous it is and it destroys success and fosters failure in all aspects of our lives, including family and in our careers.</p>
           <p class="">To think that my depression started in college because I was not in the right place for me - and my whole reason for being there was to better myself for a better future, than to develop a life-long depression which only started for the very first time in college. It's unreal but it's true. This is why I applaud your hub for bringing out that depression can happen in college and how important it is to make whatever change is necessary to stop it immediately. Even if it means transferring schools or returning home for a semester or two, because depression is not normal and should never be tolerated as it can turn into a viscous life-long battle.</p>

           <p class="">I agree wade...and even those kids that "know" what they're majoring in tend to switch majors when they get to college and realize they're not cut out for it. So don't feel bad that you don't know yet.</p>

           <p class="">I feel like choosing a major is a big part of our problems. Even through all the studying we do, no one really knows what their really passionate about. And some kids are lucky and realize their passion earlier in age.</p>

           <p class="">I think that, especially lately, choosing a major can be particularly hard on prospective and even current students. Job security doesn't really exist anymore, coupled with the fact that there is still a lot of pressure to decide what industry to pursue.</p>

I can relate to many of these.\n\nThe point about knowing your limits is well-taken.  In my case, I had a scholarship that mandated I take at least 15 credit hours per semester (a \"full load\") ... but I often took 19.  The idea was to get through quickly so as to save money.  But in terms of actual learning, of course it is better to take fewer credit hours, and spend more time studying them in-depth ... to actually learn the material rather than just being exposed to it.  However, even with 19 credit hours, I could have spent more time marinading myself in the material.  So much of my time I frittered away on hobbies, clubs, recreational reading. \n\nRegarding problems with roommates, friends, and significant others ... as you say, there's no silver bullet for these things.  I do agree that taking some time away can be good for a student having roommate problems ... but it might also be good to ask ourselves, \"Am I contributing to this problem, in fact might I be a large part of it?\"  College students are young adults, just learning to relate to others as adults, still in a lot of ways thinking like kids (if my own experience is any guide).  They might encounter people who will not put up with them in the ways that their family have learned to.  This is part of growing up and maturing. \n\nYoung adulthood is also the time of life when certain health problems may come to the fore ... for example, it could be rheumatoid arthritis, migraines, bipolar disorder, depression ... \n\nRegarding the emphasis on \"what's your major,\" college is not the ideal place for everyone to find or develop what they are good at.  Many might do better with trade school or jumping right into a career.  But perhaps that's a topic for another hub.

To keep me up the whole night, I took a beverage containing a high dosage of caffeine. True enough, I was able to read almost all of the texts until 3AM before finally retiring. However, when it was time for me to take the exam all I could see every time I recall the information is darkness. Completely hopeless and nearly sobbing, I submitted my answer sheet wearily with no other thing or solution in mind but a prayer that God will help me pass the subject. Just lately, when I checked my grades I found out that I did not only pass, it is also a little bit higher than the cut off grade! With it I proved to myself that God answered my prayer. My passing of the subject is not just a mere consequence, but a product of a will. I already learned my lesson from that experience of mine and I am hoping that I will not stumble upon the same mistake again by managing my time properly.\nThank you for sharing this hub!
