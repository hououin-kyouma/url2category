Through good communication skills team members can create an ambience of open communication, concise messages, probe for clarifications, recognize nonverbal signals, and develop mutual understanding. Good communication involves a set of complex skills that can be mastered with training and practice.</li>

        <li>Strong communication is fundamental to the teacher-family relationship and to building a sense of community between home and school. Graham-Clay discusses how communication occurs and offers a variety of effective strategies that teachers can use to make communication with parents as effective and successful as possible. Teachers strive to establish partnerships with parents to support student learning. Teachers must continue to develop and expand their skills in order to maximize effective communication with parents. Barriers to effective communication are considered in conjunction with potential solutions.</li>

        <li><a name="two"></a> <b>Focus on Understanding Elements of Collaboration and Contextual Influences<br> </b>Learning to form effective partnerships requires a thorough understanding of collaboration. In addition to strong communication and interaction skills, effective collaboration requires awareness of the complexity and subtlety of collaboration as is often seen in the variety or programs or services in which it occurs including teams, consultation, co-teaching, co-planning, co-assessing, and family partnerships. The context in which the collaborative services are to be delivered is the final component to consider. Among context features are administrative and structural support for collaboration such as scheduled collaboration, class size or caseload, and professional development opportunities. </li>

        <li><b><a name="three"></a>Engage in Co-Teaching</b><br> “Co-teaching” is an increasingly common practice in today’s schools and the quality of instruction and the benefits for students vary considerably. There is often confusion about what co-teaching is and how it differs from other in-class services. The unevenness of its implementation is widely recognized. Co-teaching, as supported by its many advocates, is a service delivery option for providing special education or related services to students with disabilities or other special needs while they remain in their general education classes. Co-teaching occurs when two or more professionals jointly plan and deliver substantive instruction to a diverse, blended group of students in a single space.&nbsp; </li>

        <li>Differential effects of a peer tutoring intervention on the academic achievement of 203 7th-grade science students with and without disabilities in co-teaching and non-co-teaching settings were examined over an 8-week period. Results indicate that the peer tutoring intervention was associated with improvements in student performance, and students in co-teaching settings perform better than those in non-co-teaching settings, but no additional value was added when peer tutoring was implemented in co-taught classrooms. </li>

        <li>Co-teaching has evolved rapidly as a strategy for ensuring that students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) have access to the general education curriculum while still receiving the specialized instruction to which they are entitled. Co-teaching illustrates the complexity of conceptualizing and studying collaboration in special education. Most inquiry on co-teaching has emphasized co-teachers' roles and relationships or program logistics rather than demonstrating its impact on student achievement and other key outcomes Contributing to the admittedly equivocal evidence base for co-teaching are factors such as the still emerging understanding of this special education service delivery vehicle, inconsistencies in definitions and implementation, lack of professional preparation, and dilemmas related to situating co-teaching in a supportive, collaborative school culture. </li>

        <li>The text is written for courses that prepare special and general educators and related service providers to form successful partnerships with families of children with disabilities. This practical book instructs teachers and families on how to empower, collaborate, and advocate for children with special needs. Strong in its depiction of family systems theory (Part I), the history and current status of policy (Part II), and the principles of partnership and their application by teachers and other professionals (Part III), the text also offers a plethora of practical advice for educators and true ways to apply these principles on the job. The book includes authentic stories, depictions of how families and education professionals partner together for the education of special needs children, the challenges they faced along the way, the solutions, and ways they overcome these obstacles.</li>

        <li>The development of collaborative partnerships between parents and professionals is too often unsuccessful. One reason for this failure may be the lack of empirical understanding of the components of interpersonal partnerships. Using qualitative inquiry, 33 focus groups were conducted with adult family members of children with and without disabilities and service providers and administrators. In addition, 32 individual interviews were conducted with non-English-speaking parents and their service providers. Indicators of professional behavior facilitative of collaborative partnerships were identified. These indicators were organized into six broad themes: (a) Communication, (b) Commitment, (c) Equality, (d) Skills, (e) Trust, and (f) Respect. The specific meaning of each theme is described, including similarities and differences between professionals and family members. </li>

NNPS, a major project of the Center on School, Family, and Community Partnerships, was founded by director, Dr. Joyce L. Epstein. NNPS guides leaders in schools, districts, states, and organizations to use research-based approaches to develop, implement, and evaluate their programs of school, family, and community partnerships. School programs of family and community involvement not only improve the school climate, but also help students improve attendance, behavior, and skills in specific subjects (e.g., reading, writing, math, science) and other important outcomes. In NNPS, district and state leaders are helped to organize leadership activities to assist all schools to conduct effective partnership programs and practices. See the Web site for information, publications, professional development conferences, best practices, other benefits and services, and how to join NNPS.</li>
