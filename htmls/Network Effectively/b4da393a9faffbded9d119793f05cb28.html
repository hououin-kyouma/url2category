     <h2>What Social Workers Do<span class="oco-about">[<a href="/careers/about#nature">About this section</a>] [<a href="#top">To Top</a>]</span></h2> 
     <p>Social workers help people solve and cope with problems in their everyday lives. One group of social workers—clinical social workers—also diagnose and treat mental, behavioral, and emotional issues.</p> 
     <h3>Duties of Social Workers</h3> 
     <p>Social workers typically do the following:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Identify people and communities in need of help</li> 
      <li>Assess clients’ needs, situations, strengths, and support networks to determine their goals</li> 
      <li>Help clients adjust to changes and challenges in their lives, such as illness, divorce, or unemployment</li> 
      <li>Research, refer, and advocate for community resources, such as food stamps, childcare, and healthcare to assist and improve a client’s well-being</li> 
      <li>Respond to crisis situations such as child abuse and mental health emergencies</li> 
      <li>Follow up with clients to ensure that their situations have improved</li> 
      <li>Evaluate services provided to ensure that they are effective</li> 
      <li>Develop and evaluate programs and services to ensure that basic client needs are met</li> 
      <li>Provide psychotherapy services</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>Social workers help people cope with challenges in their lives. They help with a wide range of situations, such as adopting a child or being diagnosed with a terminal illness.</p> 
     <p>Social workers may work with children, people with disabilities, and people with serious illnesses and addictions. Their work varies based on the type of client they are working with.</p> 
     <p>Some social workers work with groups, community organizations, and policymakers to develop or improve programs, services, policies, and social conditions. This focus of work is referred to as macro social work.</p> 
     <p>Advocacy is an important aspect of social work. Social workers advocate or raise awareness with and on behalf of their clients and the social work profession on local, state, and national levels.</p> 
     <p>The following are examples of types of social workers:</p> 
     <p><strong><em>Child and family social workers</em></strong> protect vulnerable children and help families in need of assistance. They help families find housing or services, such as childcare, or apply for benefits, such as food stamps. They intervene when children are in danger of neglect or abuse. Some help arrange adoptions, locate foster families, or work to reunite families.</p> 
     <p><strong><em>Clinical social workers</em></strong>—also called <em>licensed clinical social workers</em>—diagnose and treat mental, behavioral, and emotional disorders, including anxiety and depression. They provide individual, group, family, and couples therapy; they work with clients to develop strategies to change behavior or cope with difficult situations; and they refer clients to other resources or services, such as support groups or other mental health professionals. Clinical social workers can develop treatment plans with the client, doctors, and other healthcare professionals and may adjust the treatment plan if necessary based on their client’s progress. They may also provide mental healthcare to help children and families cope with changes in their lives, such as divorce or other family problems.</p> 
     <p>Many clinical social workers work in private practice. In these settings, clinical social workers also perform administrative and recordkeeping tasks, such as working with insurance companies in order to receive payment for their services. Some work in a group practice with other social workers or mental health professionals.</p> 
     <p><strong><em>School social workers</em></strong> work with teachers, parents, and school administrators to develop plans and strategies to improve students’ academic performance and social development. Students and their families are often referred to social workers to deal with problems such as aggressive behavior, bullying, or frequent absences from school.</p> 
     <p><strong><em>Healthcare social workers</em></strong> help patients understand their diagnosis and make the necessary adjustments to their lifestyle, housing, or healthcare. For example, they may help people make the transition from the hospital back to their homes and communities. In addition, they may provide information on services, such as home healthcare or support groups, to help patients manage their illness or disease. Social workers help <a href="/careers/physicians-and-surgeons">doctors</a> and other healthcare professionals understand the effects that diseases and illnesses have on patients’ mental and emotional health.</p> 
     <p>Some healthcare social workers specialize in geriatric social work, hospice and palliative care, or medical social work:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><strong><em>Geriatric social workers</em></strong> help senior citizens and their families. They help clients find services, such as programs that provide older adults with meals or with home healthcare. They may provide information about assisted living facilities or nursing homes, or work with older adults in those settings. They help clients and their families make plans for possible health complications or for where clients will live if they can no longer care for themselves.</li> 
      <li><strong><em>Hospice and palliative care social workers</em></strong> help patients adjust to serious, chronic, or terminal illnesses. Palliative care focuses on relieving or preventing pain and other symptoms associated with serious illness. Hospice is a type of palliative care for people who are dying. Social workers in this setting provide and find services, such as support groups or grief counselors, to help patients and their families cope with the illness or disease.</li> 
      <li><strong><em>Medical social workers</em></strong> in hospitals help patients and their families by linking patients with resources in the hospital and in their own community. They may work with medical staff to create discharge plans, make referrals to community agencies, facilitate support groups, or conduct followup visits with patients once they have been discharged.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><strong><em>Mental health and substance abuse social workers</em></strong> help clients with mental illnesses or addictions. They provide information on services, such as support groups and 12-step programs, to help clients cope with their illness. Many clinical social workers function in these roles as well.</p>

     <h2>Work Environment for Social Workers<span class="oco-about">[<a href="/careers/about#conditions">About this section</a>] [<a href="#top">To Top</a>]</span></h2> 
     <p>Social workers held about 649,300 jobs in 2014. The industries that employed the most social workers were as follows:</p> 
     <table class="oco-conditions"> 
      <tbody> 
       <tr> 
        <td>State and local government, excluding education and hospitals</td> 
        <td style="text-align: right;">29%</td>

        <td>Nursing and residential care facilities</td> 
        <td style="text-align: right;">9</td> 
       </tr> 
      </tbody> 
     </table> 
     <p>They work in the following settings:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Hospitals, primary care settings, and clinics, including veterans clinics</li> 
      <li>Senior centers and long-term care facilities</li> 
      <li>Settlement houses and community centers</li> 
      <li>Mental health clinics</li> 
      <li>Private practices</li> 
      <li>State and local governments</li> 
      <li>Schools, colleges, and universities</li> 
      <li>Substance abuse clinics</li> 
      <li>Military bases and hospitals</li> 
      <li>Correctional facilities</li> 
      <li>Child welfare agencies</li> 
      <li>Employee assistance programs</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>Although most social workers work in an office, they may spend time visiting clients. School social workers may be assigned to multiple schools and travel around the school district to see students. Understaffing and large caseloads may cause the work to be stressful.</p> 
     <p>Social workers may work remotely through distance counseling, using videoconferencing or mobile technology to meet with clients and organize support and advocacy groups. Distance counseling can be effective for clients with paranoia or social anxiety and for clients who live in rural areas.</p> 
     <h3>Social Worker Work Schedules</h3> 
     <p>Social workers generally work full time. They sometimes work evenings, weekends, and holidays to see clients or attend meetings.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="become"> 
     <h2>How to Become a Social Worker<span class="oco-about">[<a href="/careers/about#become">About this section</a>] [<a href="#top">To Top</a>]</span></h2> 
     <p><strong>Get the education you need:</strong> <a href="/education/healthcare/public-health">Find schools for Social Workers near you!</a></p> 
     <p>Although most social workers need a bachelor’s degree in social work, clinical social workers must have a master’s degree and 2 years of post-master’s experience in a supervised clinical setting. Clinical social workers must also be licensed in the state in which they practice.</p> 
     <h3>Social Worker Education</h3> 
     <p>A bachelor’s degree in social work (BSW) is the most common requirement for entry-level positions. However, some employers may hire workers who have a bachelor’s degree in a related field, such as psychology or sociology.</p> 
     <p>A BSW prepares students for direct-service positions such as caseworker or mental health assistant. These programs teach students about diverse populations, human behavior, social welfare policy, and ethics in social work. All programs require students to complete supervised fieldwork or an internship.</p> 
     <p>Some positions require a master’s degree in social work (MSW), which generally takes 2 years to complete. Master’s degree programs in social work prepare students for work in their chosen specialty by developing clinical assessment and management skills. All programs require students to complete a supervised practicum or an internship.</p> 
     <p>A bachelor’s degree in social work is not required in order to enter a master’s degree program in social work. Although a degree in almost any major is acceptable, courses in psychology, sociology, economics, and political science are recommended. Some programs allow graduates with a bachelor’s degree in social work to earn their master’s degree in 1 year.</p> 
     <p>In 2015, there were more than 500 bachelor’s degree programs and more than 200 master’s degree programs accredited by the Council on Social Work Education.</p> 
     <p>Some universities offer doctoral programs in social work, where students can earn a Doctorate of Social Work (DSW) or a Ph.D. Most doctoral programs in social work require students to have a master’s in social work and experience in the field. Many doctor’s students go on to work as <a href="/careers/postsecondary-teachers">postsecondary teachers</a>.</p> 
     <h3>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</h3> 
     <p>Most states have licensure or certification requirements for nonclinical social workers. Requirements vary by state.</p> 
     <p>All states require clinical social workers to be licensed. However, some states provide exemptions for clinical social workers who work in government agencies. Becoming a licensed clinical social worker requires a master’s degree in social work and a minimum of 2 years of supervised clinical experience after graduation. After completing their supervised experience, clinical social workers must pass a clinical exam to be licensed.</p> 
     <p>Because licensing requirements vary by state, those interested should contact their state board. For more information about regulatory licensure boards by state, contact the Association of Social Work Boards.</p> 
     <h3>Important Qualities for Social Workers</h3> 
     <p><strong><em>Communication skills.</em></strong> Clients talk to social workers about challenges in their lives. To effectively help, social workers must be able to listen to and understand their clients’ needs.</p> 
     <p><strong><em>Empathy.</em></strong> Social workers often work with people who are in stressful and difficult situations. To develop strong relationships, they must have compassion and empathy for their clients.</p> 
     <p><strong><em>Interpersonal skills.</em></strong> Being able to work with different groups of people is essential for social workers. They need strong people skills to foster healthy and productive relationships with their clients and colleagues.</p> 
     <p><strong><em>Organizational skills.</em></strong> Social workers must help and manage multiple clients, often assisting with their paperwork or documenting their treatment.</p> 
     <p><strong><em>Problem-solving skills.</em></strong> Social workers need to develop practical and innovative solutions to their clients’ problems.</p> 
     <p><strong><em>Time-management skills.</em></strong> Social workers often have many clients and administrative responsibilities. They must effectively manage their time to provide adequate service to all of their clients.</p>

     <h2>Job Outlook for Social Workers<span class="oco-about">[<a href="/careers/about#outlook">About this section</a>] [<a href="#top">To Top</a>]</span></h2> 
     <p>Overall employment of social workers is projected to grow 12 percent from 2014 to 2024, faster than the average for all occupations. Employment growth will be driven by increased demand for healthcare and social services, but will vary by social worker specialty.</p> 
     <p>Employment of child, family, and school social workers is projected to grow 6 percent from 2014 to 2024, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Child and family social workers will be needed to work with families to strengthen parenting skills, prevent child abuse, and identify alternative homes for children who are unable to live with their biological families. In schools, more social workers will be needed due to rising student enrollments. However, employment growth of child, family, and school social workers may be limited by federal, state, and local budget constraints.</p> 
     <p>Employment of healthcare social workers is projected to grow 19 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. Healthcare social workers will continue to be needed to help aging populations and their families adjust to new treatments, medications, and lifestyles.</p> 
     <p>Employment of mental health and substance abuse social workers is projected to grow 19 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. Employment will grow as more people seek treatment for mental illness and substance abuse. In addition, drug offenders are increasingly being sent to treatment programs, which are staffed by these social workers, rather than being sent to jail.</p> 
     <h3>Social Workers Job Prospects</h3> 
     <p>Overall, job prospects should be good, particularly so for candidates with a master’s degree and licensure.</p>
