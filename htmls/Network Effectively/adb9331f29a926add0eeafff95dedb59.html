  <font size="+1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </font>One of the most valuable things a teacher can do is to help students prepare for lifelong learning.&nbsp; Improved 
  <font color="#CC0000">learning skills</font> &#x2014; concentrating, reading and listening, remembering, using time, and more &#x2014; are immediately useful and will continue paying dividends for a long time. 
  <br> &nbsp; 
  <h2><font size="+1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Motivations and Learning Strategies</b></font></h2> 
  <font size="+1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </font>Personal motives for learning can be immediate or long-term, extrinsic or intrinsic.&nbsp; You may be eager to learn because it's fun now, or it will be useful later, or both.&nbsp; When students discover that it's fun to learn and think, they'll want to do it more often and more skillfully!&nbsp; The 
  <i>master skill</i> of "learning how to learn" is illustrated with true stories (why employers hired an unconventional worker, and how I didn't learn to ski) in 
  <a href="http://designprocessineducation.com/design-thinking/index.htm?left=website.htm%23br&amp;right=mo.htm%23life" target="_top">Effective Learning - Motivations and Strategies for Personal Education</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  <a href="http://designprocessineducation.com/design-thinking/index.htm?left=website.htm%23mctwo" target="_top">Problem Solving &amp; Metacognition in Education</a> has summaries of these ideas, and much more.

  <font size="+1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </font>A related 
  <i>master skills</i> are 
  <a href="http://designprocessineducation.com/design-thinking/index.htm?left=website.htm%23mc&amp;right=mc-we.htm" target="_top">metacognition &amp; knowing how to learn</a> plus associated ideas-and-skills: motivation, self-efficacy, self-regulation, formative feedback.

  <font size="+1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </font>
  <font color="#CC0000">study</font> is 
  <font color="#660099">"the process of applying the mind in order to acquire knowledge"</font> (Webster's Dictionary) so 
  <i><b>study skills</b></i> are 
  <i><b>learning skills</b></i> that are also 
  <i> <b>thinking skills</b></i> when study includes 
  <font color="#660099">"careful attention to, and critical examination and investigation of, a subject."</font>
  <br> 
  <font size="+1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </font>Of course, we don't want to "learn" things that are not useful or are simply wrong (are not true) since our main problem, as noted by Mark Twain, is 
  <font color="#000066">"what we know that just ain't so."&nbsp;</font> Therefore, we should wisely 
  <i>evaluate ideas</i> with 
  <a href="../think/critical.htm#i">critical thinking</a>.&nbsp; We can also explore strategies (and attitudes) for 
  <i>generating ideas</i> with 
  <a href="../think/creative.htm#i">creative thinking</a>.&nbsp; And learning, both individual and collective, can be improved by disciplined methods for effectively using these 
  <a href="../think/methods.htm#i"> thinking skills and problem-solving strategies</a> as in 
  <i>design process</i> and 
  <i>scientific method.</i>

  <p><font size="+1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </font>Because learning and thinking are closely related, <a href="../teach/active.htm#i">modern theories of learning</a> (constructivism,...) emphasize the importance of THINKING when we learn.</p>
