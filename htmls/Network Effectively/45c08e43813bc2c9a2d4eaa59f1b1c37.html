(SPAN) empowers families, professionals, and other individuals interested in the well-being and educational rights of children. We work towards this goal by providing information, training, technical assistance, support and the exchange of ideas. SPAN’s special commitment is to those children with the greatest need due to disability, poverty, discrimination based on race, sex, or language, or other special needs. SPAN’s goal is to enable all children to become fully participating and contributing members of society. SPAN’s multifaceted program is carried out by a bilingual, multiracial staff of parents of children with and without disabilities.</font></p></td>
