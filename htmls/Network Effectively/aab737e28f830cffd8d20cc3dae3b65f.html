     <p><strong>Course Summary</strong></p>
     <p>It is common for health promoters to be viewed as being in the business of community development, but many do not have formal training in community development. Also, it is not always clear to what extent health promoters are mandated by their employers or funders to become involved in community development activities. This course is designed for health promoters to develop a basic understanding of basic values, principles and methods of community development and how they may be applied within their own work setting. Specific community development applications and methods, such as community asset mapping, will be explored. Appropriate roles of health promoters in collaborating with other organizations to work on broad community issues will be considered, along with factors that contribute to the success of community partnerships and coalitions. The course includes readings, exercises, case studies and resources for further information.&nbsp; This course will help you to become an informed participant or perhaps even a leader in community development initiatives in your community.</p>
     <p><strong>Course Goal</strong></p>
     <p>The goal of this course is to&nbsp;increase the capacity of health promoters to engage and empower communities to improve their quality of life, through the application of community development values, concepts and strategies.</p>
     <p><strong>Course Objectives</strong></p>
     <p>Upon completion of the course, participants will have gained knowledge and skills in the following areas:</p>
     <ul class="unIndentedList">
      <li>Community development values, concepts and practice, and how it differs from community outreach and community-based programs</li>
      <li>Community asset mapping</li>
      <li>Aligning&nbsp;health services with community priorities and values</li>
      <li>Success factors in community partnerships and collaborations</li>
     </ul>
     <p><strong>Overview of the organization of the course content</strong></p>
     <p>The course will be divided into the following three modules, each of which will take about 3 hours to complete.</p>
     <p>Module 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concepts, Values and Principles</p>
     <p>Module 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strategies and Methods</p>
     <p>Module 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Community Collaboration</p>

     <h1 class="book-heading">Module One: Concepts, Values and Principles</h1> 
     <p>Most health promoters&nbsp;are not community developers, but in many ways they can facilitate and contribute to community development. Community Development can take place in many different settings and program contexts. In terms of their direct services to clients, health promoters often work with people to help them reach their goals, and&nbsp;provide programs, services and resources that meet community needs. Health promoters also learn from the community and adapt their programs, services, and policies to meet the community needs and interests.&nbsp;Beyond the scope of their specific mandate, health promoters&nbsp;may also partner with other organizations to provide resources and become engaged in community development initiatives that involve broad community collaborations. All of these activities can be viewed as community development practice.<a name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p> 
     <p>The following overview of the basic concepts, values and principles of community development will provide a general orientation that will enable you to contribute to community development within your organization and participate effectively in collaborative community development initiatives. It may also help you to identify and respond to opportunities for community development activities.</p>

      <h1 class="book-heading">Definition and Characteristics of Communities</h1> 
      <p>The term "community" is used extensively in almost all areas of our lives. It is used in both our common, everyday language and also by professionals, politicians and corporations. We frequently hear about "community care", "community revitalization", "community service" and many other references to community. Yet, while everyone seems to have a fairly common understanding of what is meant by "community" it eludes a clear and comprehensive definition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The word "community" is derived from Latin and has been used in the English language since the 14<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; It refers to both the development of a social grouping and also the nature of the relationship among the members. The term is most often associated with one or more of the following characteristics: </p>
      <ul class="unIndentedList">
       <li>common people, as distinguished from those of rank or authority; </li>
       <li>a relatively small society</li>
       <li>the people of a district;</li>
       <li>the quality of holding something in common</li>
       <li>a sense of common identity and characteristics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The concept of community was further developed in the 19<sup>th</sup> century to contrast the dynamics and relationships of residents within a local setting to that of larger and more complex industrial societies. It is related to the terms <strong><em>commune</em></strong> (French) and<em> <strong>Gemeinshaft</strong></em> (German), in terms of denoting particular kind of relationships. Relationships within a community were thought to be more direct, holistic and significant than the more formal and abstract relationships with the larger society.<a name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
      <p><strong><br>Today, three main types of communities are usually identified:</strong></p>
      <p>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Geographic communities</strong> share physical space, so that residents come into contact with each other by virtue of proximity, rather than intent. However, to be a "real" community, residents must feel a sense of belonging and hold at least some values and symbols in common. &nbsp;For example, a feature of the natural landscape, such as a river, that is important to many, or a local claim to fame; such as an internationally known theatre company. In geographic communities how power is distributed has a significant impact on how the community develops.</p>
      <p>ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Co</strong><strong>mmunities of interest </strong>are sometimes referred to as "communities within communities". Members of these communities choose to associate with each on the basis of a common interest (e.g. model railway club) or shared concerns (e.g. poor air quality). Sometimes communities are formed by self-identified members of a reference group based on characteristics outside of their control, e.g. a disability, ethnic group, or low income, which give them a sense of common identity and shared concerns.</p>
      <p>iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Virtual communities</strong> are groups of people that primarily interact via communication media rather than face to face.<a name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> If the mechanism is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">computer network</a>, it is called an <em>online community</em>. Online communities are "social aggregations that emerge from the Net when people carry on those public discussions long enough, with sufficient human feeling, to form webs of personal relationships".<a name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
      <p>An individual can belong to several different communities at the same time; e.g. a faith community, a business community and a neighbourhood community.</p>
      <p>Communities can be healthy or unhealthy, with most being somewhere in the middle. In an unhealthy community there may be an environmental disaster, such as the contamination of the water supply, a high level of poverty due to a major industry closing, or entrenched conflict over a divisive community issue. The path to becoming a healthy community starts with broad community engagement, leadership, the development of a shared vision and community goals, effective planning, local government commitment and collaborative use of internal and external resources. <a name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>

      <h1 class="book-heading">Definition and History of Community Development</h1> 
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>i) <strong>Definition</strong></p>
      <p>There are many definitions of community development but the basic concept was stated by the United Nations in 1948</p>
      <p><em>"Community Development is a process designed to create conditions of economic and social progress for the whole community with its active participation and fullest possible reliance upon the community's initiative." </em></p>
      <p align="right">(quoted in Head, 1979:101)</p>
      <p>ii) <strong>Brief History of Community Development</strong></p>
      <p>Community development practice has arisen from a variety of sources and settings. Its roots can be traced to the social reform movement in Britain and North America in the latter half of the 18<sup>th</sup>century. Community development principles were formulated and applied in third world development efforts following decolonization. In the 50's and 60's CD or community organization, as it came to be called, was used in deprived or underdeveloped urban and rural settings in North America (Smith, 1979: 52). CD was a response to the perceived disintegration of society due to rapid technological change, economic dislocations, disruption in traditional family and community structures and the extension of government and commercial services into personal and family life, with negative impacts on personal effectiveness and community ties (Carey, 1979:20).&nbsp; CD is eclectic, integrating specialized knowledge from education, public health, economic development and politics. (Head, 1979:101) However, it is also a discipline unto itself, with a body of theory, standards of practice and professional associations. Masters and doctoral programs in community development are usually associated with either a school of social work or rural development.</p>

      <h1 class="book-heading">Values and Principles of Community Development</h1> 
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Community development is sometimes confused with community-based programs, community research and other forms of community interventions. The most significant feature that distinguishes community development from other community work is its values and principles.</p>
      <p>Below are a list and a brief definition of the values and principles that are typically embodied in community development programs. Additional information on these terms is available in the glossary section of this course.</p>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Democratic: </strong>The will of the majority must be carried out, but only after all voices are heard and considered and minority rights are protected.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Inclusive:</strong> There are many barriers to participation in society; poverty, disability, age, race and ethnicity are some other characteristics that often marginalize people. A healthy community embraces diversity and recognizes that all community members have a right to be heard and participate in processes that affect their lives.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Non-authoritarian: </strong>Organizational structures are as flat as possible, with all participants being seen as equally important and having equal input.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Community self determination:</strong> Community members come together to discuss their concerns, assess options and arrive at their own conclusions. They may seek advice from "experts", but consider it along with other sources of information and their own experience and make their own decisions that are right for them.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Community Ownership: </strong>Communities thrive when they develop their own assets, but also when they "own" their problems and issues. When communities accept that it is "their" problem, then they are more likely to work together to develop a solution, and the solution will be better than one provided solely by an external "expert".</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Enhance natural capacities and networks: </strong>There are sources of strength in every community; for example, informal networks and social support systems, or certain individuals that have particular talents or are able to help others in need. A community developer identifies these existing community assets and works with them. It is important not to duplicate existing structures and functions as that may weaken rather than strengthen the community.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Social justice and equity:</strong> This is fundamental to community development and is at least implicit in all CD work, if not an explicit goal of a CD program.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Universality:</strong> Services are available to everyone, without requiring means or needs testing.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Service Integration:</strong> Often services provided to persons in need are fragmented, so that one service provider doesn't know what other services are available or being used, resulting in gaps, duplications and sometimes conflicting advice or treatments. <br><br>A community development approach would ensure that services are coordinated, that they enhance and strengthen natural community and family supports, that there is effective communication among all involved, and that services are directed by the individual receiving them, to the extent possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Upstream: </strong>The distinction between upstream vs. downstream approaches uses a river as a metaphor for the increasing impact of conditions and events which affect health over time and space, and relates to the point of intervention. For example, if there is a toxic spill upstream, it will affect the quality of the water in the river for everyone living downstream. You can focus either on dealing with the illnesses that are experienced by the downstream people (downstream approach) or you can stop the spill and prevent others from happening in the future (upstream approach).</li>

         <p>For the purposes of this course, the general community development process can be synthesized into the following basic steps. However, community development is an organic process, so that while the "steps" are presented in a logical order, in reality they may not follow sequentially and some steps may either be skipped or carried out simultaneously with other steps. Please click on the title of the step to learn more about each step.</p>

         <legend>1. Learn about the community</legend>
         <div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text"> 
          <p>Whether you want to be an active member of the community, an effective service provider or a community leader, you will have to be familiar with its issues, resources, needs, power structure and decision-making processes. Your initial orientation could include reading your local newspaper regularly, attending community events, reading reports and familiarizing with available services as well as community projects and activities. Close observation of the community as you interact with it will also provide significant insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the community.</p>

          <p>You won't be able to learn everything you need to know by reading and observation. You will need to talk to others about their interests and perceptions to put it into context. You can contact community members through formal channels, such as joining a local organization, or informally by chatting with people that visit the library or that you encounter in other situations, such as shopping at local stores or attending school activities. By listening to the community you may identify an area in which there seems to be a common interest in making a change.</p> 
          <p>Health organization staff need to maintain regular contact with the community to collect enough information to make sound recommendations and decisions on health services and priorities and to identify important community issues.</p>

         <div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text"> 
          <p>Once you have identified that there are some common interests among community members and you have identified a few individuals who seem willing to work on a community development initiative, the next step is to hold a community gathering. In some circumstances it may be appropriate to invite representatives of specific organizations or sector to attend, but more often it would be a public event for a neighbourhood or, for other types of communities, for all the identified members. The purpose of this gathering would be to develop a shared "community vision"; i.e., through imagining their ideal community and discussing their ideas together they will determine arrive at a common vision and some broad strategic directions that all are committed to working towards. You may also use this gathering to ask for support for the initiative, elicit community input or invite members to join a steering committee or help in other ways.</p>

        <fieldset class="collapse-text-fieldset collapsed-text-fieldset collapsible collapsed">
         <legend>4. Assess community assets and resources, needs and issues</legend>
         <div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text"> 
          <p>To be able to work effectively in a community development context, you will need to gather some information about your community. &nbsp;It is extremely helpful to undertake a comprehensive community assessment which will collect both <strong>qualitative </strong>and <strong>quantitative </strong>data on a wide range of community features.&nbsp; Unfortunately, often time and budget restraints will necessitate choosing between methods and limiting the assessment to particular areas of interest.&nbsp; Deciding what and how much information to collect may be aided by a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis of the community, which may point to particular areas being higher priorities for action.</p> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>There are many methods of community assessment used in community development practice. A few of the more common methods are listed below; additional information is contained in the resources section.</p> 
          <p>Compiling a community demographic profile is an excellent start. It is helpful to update the profile periodically so you will be able to track changes that occur within your community and respond accordingly. A demographic profile includes statistical information about age, gender, language, visible minority status, education, and family income.&nbsp; Community demographic profiles are available for approximately 6,000 communities in Canada, along with comparative figures for Ontario, from Statistics Canada's <em>Community Profiles </em>at www.statcan.ca.</p> 
          <p>Other community statistics may also be of interest to you, such as crime rates, morbidity and mortality rates, or availability of affordable housing. Some of these are available from Statistics Canada, but local data may be obtained from local agencies; e.g. the local police service will have crime statistics.</p> 
          <p>However, simply collecting information is not sufficient; it must be analyzed in order for it to be meaningful. For example, you might be interested in the relative proportion of seniors to youth in your community, or the proportion of the population for whom English is a second language. You may want to compare the most recent data available with previous years; perhaps to identify the rate of growth of the population, changes in ethno-cultural patterns or age distribution.</p> 
          <p>Statistical information isn't the only type of information that is important to collect. Finding out how residents perceive their community is also essential to effective community development practice.&nbsp; Community surveys, community asset mapping, environmental scans, focus groups and key informant interviews are other methods of obtaining community data.&nbsp; The City of Calgary has an excellent publication on community assessments. It contains background information on the need for community assessments, describes various methods and provides easy-to-follow worksheets for planning and implementing a community assessment process.<a name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>

         <legend>5. Help community members to recognize and articulate areas of concern and their causes.</legend>
         <div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text"> 
          <p>In any community development process, it is the community that is in the driver's seat. Community members will define the issues and the process for resolving them, which might be quite different than what would be proposed by an external "expert". However, it is the community members that are most familiar with the situation and, in many cases, have knowledge and wisdom that an external "expert" lacks. By providing tools, resources, meeting space and facilitation, community developers <strong>empower</strong> the community to start to take ownership of the issues and the development of solutions.</p> 
          <p><em>If we genuinely want to empower [communities], we must do it in such a way that they become independent of our charity, that they become self reliant, that they can sustain their own development without our help.<a name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3"><strong>[3]</strong></a></em></p>

         <legend>6. Establish a 'vehicle for change'</legend>
         <div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text"> 
          <p>In most circumstances it will be necessary to create a "vehicle for change" for an organizational change, which in most cases will start as a steering committee. Depending on the circumstances, this nature of the group could range from a few unaffiliated individuals or a coalition of organizations and institutions. In time, the steering committee may evolve into or be adopted by a community organization. There is a wide range of activities that the steering committee will need to undertake to ensure that it will be able to plan, organize, implement and evaluate the initiative effectively, including developing a charter or terms of reference, establishing governance policies, obtaining sufficient resources to carry out the work and identifying potential partners who can contribute to its success.</p>

         <div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text"> 
          <p>Assuming that the community as a whole has set the strategic directions for the initiative, the steering committee will now develop the action plan. Depending on the size of the group and the complexity of the initiative, there may be other steps between setting the strategic directions and the action plan. You may want to create a comprehensive strategic plan containing long, mid and short-term objectives, and mid-level plans for communications, resource development or human resources. In addition, if there are a number of activities or events to plan, you will need a separate action plan for each one.&nbsp; The point you need to arrive at is a well thought out plan that is easily comprehended by community members, clearly links activities with objectives and indicates responsibilities, time frames and resources required.</p>

         <legend>8. Implement action plan</legend>
         <div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text"> 
          <p>This is the heart of the initiative, in which financial and human resources, including volunteers and community members, are <strong>mobilized</strong> to take action. This may take many different forms. Perhaps the community has decided to establish a coalition against homelessness and is working to ensure all organizations that come into contact with homeless persons are able to provide referrals to appropriate sources of assistance. The actions might consist of:</p> 
          <ul type="disc"> 
           <li>working with community workers to identify needs and appropriate services;</li> 
           <li>developing informational brochures;</li>

           <li>meeting with organizational representatives to provide further information.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>In addition to implementing the various action steps, it is important to ensure that the factors that are required for the success of any community initiative are in place, such as:</p> 
          <ul type="disc"> 
           <li>shared vision and purpose</li> 
           <li>concrete, attainable goals and objectives</li>

           <li>clear roles and policy guidelines</li> 
           <li>mutual respect</li> 
           <li>open communications, including both formal and informal methods</li> 
           <li>recognition that there are "process" people and there are "action" people; ensure there is a variety of ways of participating in or contributing to the initiative</li>

         <div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text"> 
          <p>Traditionally, community development workers have relied more on their own experience, anecdotal evidence from others to guide their practice rather than formal evaluation procedures. Often it is difficult to find reasonable and appropriate measures in terms of the cost and time involved, especially when the desired outcomes, as is often the case with prevention and capacity-building initiatives, may not be seen for several years.&nbsp; However, there are many reasons why it is important to evaluate your work. Most importantly, you may need to demonstrate that you have not caused any harm to others through your actions. Other reasons to evaluate may be to demonstrate the effectiveness of the initiative so that it will be continued, to satisfy funder requirements and to provide information that will be useful to others or to subsequent initiatives. Evaluation plans may be formal or informal and tailored to the needs and resources of the group. IN community development, a participatory evaluation method is usually conducted in addition to or sometimes in place of more traditional method. Participatory evaluation involves program participants and/or community members in the evaluation design, data collection, and the analysis and interpretation of results.</p>

          <p>Allow time for the group to catch its breath before embarking on the next initiative. Thank everyone that contributed and make sure there is good follow up communication with media, partner and funders. Celebrate your successes and reflect on any disappointments that might have occurred. Discuss how well the organizational processes and structures worked and identify areas that need some attention before the next rush of activity occurs. Also, it is important to provide a space for participants to reflect on their personal development as a result of being part of the group. When the group is ready to tackle a new initiative, they might want to revisit the community assessment information and the strategic directions and decide whether either of those steps need to be repeated.</p>

      <h1 class="book-heading">Community Development Roles</h1> 
      <p>A community developer may take on a variety of different roles and s/he works with the community. However, in all the roles, the worker always respects the autonomy and self-determination of the community members and does not impose an externally directed agenda upon them. Their work conforms to professional standards and ethics and is comprehensive and systematic in its approach.</p> 
      <p>Currently, there are few positions that are explicitly named "Community Developer" and it is increasingly more common for managers and employees in a variety of settings to be expected to take a community development approach to their work. There are many opportunities for anyone who is involved with community members to incorporate a community development role into their practice.</p> 
      <p>In community development literature, the roles commonly ascribed to community development workers are enabler, guide, technical expert and liaison.<a href="#_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a></p> 
      <p><strong>Guide:</strong> As a guide, the worker helps the community identify their goals and find the means to achieve them.</p> 
      <p><strong>Enabler:</strong> The worker can enable the community in a variety of ways. S/he might facilitate a problem solving process with the community, which could include helping them to articulate dissatisfactions and identify their causes. The worker could also help them to organize and plan their activities and encourage positive interpersonal relationships. The enabler role is most associated with locality development strategies.</p> 
      <p><strong>Technical Assistant: </strong>This "expert" role is most associated with social planning. However, in all forms of community development there is usually some need by the community to access technical support, in areas such as community assessment, media relations, accessing information or project development.</p> 
      <p><strong>Liaison/Advocate: </strong>Depending on the nature of the community and the type of community development initiative it has taken on, there may be a need for the worker to assume a liaison or advocacy role. S/he may be the intermediary between the community and other bodies such as government, institutions or other community factions. The worker may be asked by the community to present their views, access information or negotiate an agreement.</p>

      <h1 class="book-heading">Tool: Mapping Your Community Assets</h1> 
      <p>Community <strong><em>asset mapping </em></strong>is a positive approach to building strong communities, developed by John Kretzmann and John McKnight, of the Asset-Based Community Development Institute at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. &nbsp;The Community Asset Mapping process outlined by Kretzmann and McKnight in their guidebook <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Building Communities from the Inside Out: A Path Towards Finding and Mobilising a Communit's Assets</span></em><a name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></em>describes in detail a process to mobilize a community to use its <strong><em>assets</em></strong> to develop a plan to solve its problems and improve residents' quality of life.</p> 
      <p>Traditional methods of community work tend to focus on a community's deficits; i.e. their needs and problems. Often, one of the first steps of a community worker is to undertake a needs assessment of the community, which usually focusses on issues :such as unemployment, poverty, crime and illiteracy, while ignoring the assets that exist in the community. Working from a "needs" perspective generally leads to external funds and services being sought&nbsp; to help the community. While these may indeed have positive benefits to community residents, often the result is a fragmented patchwork of services. Many of the services may not be appropriate to the culture and dynamics of that particular community, and do not contribute to building the <strong><em>capacity</em></strong> of the community or empower individuals to be self-sufficient. In a nutshell, "needs-based" assessments tend to lead to community dependence rather than community development.</p> 
      <p>Kretzmann and McKnight propose that community developers start with a "clear commitment to discovering a community's capacities and assets". (Kretzmann and McKnight 1993, p.1).&nbsp; The asset-based approach does not remove the need for outside resources, but makes their use more effective by:&nbsp;</p> 
      <ul class="unIndentedList"> 
       <li>starting with what is present in the community </li> 
       <li>concentrating on the agenda-building and problem-solving capacity of the residents </li> 
       <li>stressing local determination, investment, creativity, and control<a name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>Each community has assets to be preserved and enhanced. These assets can be used by residents as the foundation from which to build a postive future. Beyond developing a simple inventory, this 'mapping' process is designed to promote connections or relationships between individuals, between individuals and organizations, and between organizations and organizations. Combining community assets creates a synergy that exponentially increases the capacity of the community to meet the needs of its residents. The&nbsp; information collected through this asset-mapping process may also be used as the foundation for many other processes, such as strategic planning, community mobilization and community economic development.</p> 
      <p>Community assets include:</p> 
      <ul class="unIndentedList"> 
       <li>Skills, knowledge, talents and experience of local residents</li> 
       <li>Community associations, many of which provide benefits far beyond their mandate</li> 
       <li>Businesses</li> 
       <li>Schools, churches, libraries and other institutions that operate within the community </li> 
       <li>Municipal services such as police, fire, parks and recreation services</li> 
       <li>Other social services and community organizations</li> 
       <li>Physical structures; e.g. town square, heritage buildings</li> 
       <li>Natural resources; e.g. river, trees, green space</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>The first step in community asset mapping is to work with community members to develop a plan for documenting the community's assets.&nbsp; On the next page you will find some ideas for getting started on an asset-mapping project.</p>

      <p><strong>(a) Mapping Individual Capacity</strong></p> 
      <p>Different methods can be used for creating an individual capacity inventory. Personal interviews will yield more in-depth information bust is very costly. Other possibilities are</p> 
      <ul>
       <li>Mailing out a survey</li>
       <li>Dropping off surveys door-to-door</li>
       <li>Have surveys available at convenient locations for people to pick up and return</li>
       <li>Telephone calls</li>
       <li>Meet people in groups<a name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></li>
      </ul> 
      <p>Kretzmann and McKnight's guide provides a template for an individual capacity inventory to identify a wide array of skills and experience of residents which they are able to contribute to the community. It is critical that the capacity inventory is not seen as a study of neighbourhood residents, but as a community development tool.&nbsp; It should be designed and presented in a way that will encourage residents to view themselves as having valuable assets that they could contribute to the community and to connect people that that can help each other. The plan will also need to identify the human and financial resources required to complete the asset map. Once the plan is in place, an individual capacity assessment is conducted, followed by an inventory of other community assets. Once the assets are identified, they are analyzed to find their "points of connection"<a name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>, forming the basis of a community mobilization process.</p> 
      <p><strong>(b) Mapping Groups, Organizations and Institutions</strong></p> 
      <p>The Community Tool Box<a name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> provides a simple set of guidelines for taking an inventory of all the groups (associations, organizations, and institutions) that exist in the community. One method is to simply make a list. Here are some of their suggestions for getting starting:</p> 
      <p>1. Get out a pad and start writing. Begin with what you know. Write down anything that comes to mind. You can always correct your list later. <em>You can do this work by yourself; but it might be more useful and fun to work with others. This is also a great project for students or interns.</em></p> 
      <p>2. Use other sources of information to add to your list. These can include:</p> 
      <ul type="disc">
       <li>The yellow pages are a free, comprehensive, and often excellent source. </li>
       <li>Town directories, published for your community alone. </li>
       <li>Lists of businesses, probably available from the chamber of commerce. </li>
       <li>Lists of organizations - check your library or town hall. </li>
       <li>The local newspaper, newsletters and other print sources </li>
       <li>Bulletin boards. Physical bulletin boards, for sure; and also community-calendar type listings that might be found on local cable television. </li>
       <li>Your friends and colleagues. They may know about other lists available or of groups, organizations, and community assets that are not on anybody else's lists. </li>
      </ul> 
      <p>3. To expand your list further, check the <a href="http://ctb.ku.edu/tools/en/sub_section_tools_1043.htm#tools1#tools1">Community Capacity Inventory</a><a name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a>, provided by the Community Tool Box.</p> 
      <p>4. Learn more about each organization you have identified. You can inquire about available staffing, space, equipment, expertise, and willingness to help and get involved in a variety of ways. This will take more time but may be well worth it. For some possible questions you can ask, see <strong><a href="http://ctb.ku.edu/tools/en/sub_section_tools_1043.htm#tools2#tools2">Questions to ask while capacity mapping</a>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>5. Refine and revise your list. You can put it on a computer, if you haven't done so already. You can also break your list down in several different ways: alphabetically, geographically, by type of function, by size, by public/private membership or governance, or however you want.</p> 
      <p><strong>(c) Creating a Map</strong></p> 
      <p>"Mapping" involves identifying relationships, whether to the geographic landscape, to other organizations or to other community features. Maps are good visual aids: when you can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">see</span> the data right in front of you, your understanding and insight is often increased. There are several ways to go about mapping community assets:</p> 
      <p>One mapping method is to find a large street map of your community, with few other markings. (Your local Planning Department may help here.) Then just mark with a dot, or tag, or push-pin (maybe color-coded by type) the geographic location of the groups and organizations you have found. The patterns that emerge may surprise you. You may see, for example, that certain locations have different numbers or types of associations. Those areas where few associations exist may be good targets for community development later on.</p> 
      <p>This type of mapping can also be done by computer, with an appropriate software program. These programs are more sophisticated than paper-and-pushpin mapping, as you can create "overlays," visually placing one category of map over another, for a more comprehensive view of the community. &nbsp;</p> 
      <p>You can also just diagram your resources in a way that clearly show the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">linkages</span> among different categories of assets.</p> 
      <p><strong>(d) Using community assets</strong></p> 
      <p>While there is value just in raising awareness of what exists in your community, the real value of asset mapping is realized when these assets are put to work for the benefit of the community. Some ideas from the Community Tool Box are:</p> 
      <ul type="disc">
       <li>You can publish the assets identified and make them available to all community members. In doing so, you will stimulate public asset knowledge and use. It may also attract new businesses and other opportunities to your community, thus using existing assets to create new ones. </li>
       <li>You can use your knowledge of assets to tackle a new community project -- because now you may have more resources to work on that project than you originally thought. </li>
       <li>You can find new ways to bring groups and organizations together, to learn about each other's assets -- and perhaps to work collaboratively on projects such as the one above. </li>
       <li>You can publicize these assets, and attract new businesses and other opportunities to your community. In both this example, and the ones just above, (This is what makes community work exciting!) </li>
       <li>You can set up structured programs for asset exchange, which can range from individual skill swaps to institutional cost-sharing. </li>
       <li>You can establish a process by which community assets keep getting reviewed, perhaps on a regular basis. </li>
      </ul> 
      <p>Community Building Resources in Edmonton have reported the following examples of activities that have emerged from their Community Capacity Building and Asset Mapping© efforts:</p> 
      <ul type="disc">
       <li>a church beginning a community kitchen </li>
       <li>a church started an employment program for refugees </li>
       <li>a group developing a network of Walking Trails </li>
       <li>a group developing a baby-sitting registry for new parents </li>
       <li>a group working on community gardens </li>
       <li>a Capacity Study team member was able to provide connections to a bookkeeper and a carpenter who were willing to provide their services either for free or inexpensively</li>
       <li>a community group celebrating their history gathered 400 community citizens, conducted historical walks and bus tours in the community</li>
       <li>businesses developing a Community Resource booklet<a name="_ftnref7" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a></li>
      </ul> 
      <p>While Kretzmann and McKnight propose conducting a full community asset map, many have found using a scaled-down approach to mapping particular types of assets to be helpful.&nbsp; For example, in 2003 the Youth Community Asset Mapping initiative in Vancouver completed a mapping project focussed only on parks from a youth perspective. A core group of 13 youth was trained to facilitate workshops with youth in their communities, in which they mapped and evaluated their local park. The results of the workshops were compiled into 5 park maps and 1 ideal park map. The youth then presented the results of their park mapping to the Parks Board of Vancouver and engaged in discussions with the community on how to improve the park spaces for children and youth of the community.<a name="_ftnref8" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p> 
      <p><strong>(e) Community Asset Mapping and Health Organizations</strong></p> 
      <p>Health organizations may find themselves involved in an asset-mapping exercise initiated by another organization or community collaborative, or it may begin its own process, focussed on a specific area of interest. For example, many health organizations view their partnerships with other organizations as significant assets.&nbsp; By mapping your organization's current partnerships, it is possible to identify ways of strengthening existing relationships as well as areas in which new partnerships would be beneficial. Here is one way of creating a visual partnership map.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
      <ul type="disc">
       <li>Invite a diverse group of stakeholders to participate in this exercise</li>
       <li>Brainstorm all the partnerships, both formal and informal, that your organization currently has; name the specific organizations, not just the general category; e.g. "North London Kiwanis Club", not "service clubs".</li>
       <li>Record them on a flipchart in a circle around the name of your organization. You could differentiate between formal (written agreement) and informal partnerships by having an inner and outer circle</li>
       <li>Identify the type of partnership (e.g. funder, member, information-sharing)</li>
       <li>Identify the assets shared by the partners; indicate with arrows on the map whether the sharing is unilateral or bi-lateral </li>
       <li>Review the map and consider</li>
      </ul> 
      <p>(a) whether there may be additional resources that could be shared</p> 
      <p>(b) other ways in which the partnerships could be strengthened</p> 
      <p>(c) whether there are other community groups, organizations or institutions with which partnerhips may be beneficial.</p> 
      <ul type="disc">
       <li>Using the map as a point of reference, develop and implement a partnership strategy.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In this exercise you are asked to envision yourself working in a situation where you are invited to participate in a community development initiative. Use your imagination to fill in the details of the actions you take and their results. <br><br>You may choose to print this page and complete the answers.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You are the manager of a small health organization which has been established in a strip mall within a new suburban community. During its development, little thought was given to the needs of the residents once they moved in. There are no grocery stores or department stores within a 5 mile radius. There is a small stretch of green space along the river but no other parkland or playgrounds. There is an elementary school, surrounded by pavement but no playground equipment is in place. There is no pool, skating arena, public transportation or other community facilities. This is a mixed housing development, including smaller detached houses, townhouses, several three-story walk ups and an apartment building. Housing prices are lower in this community because of its proximity to a major highway and industries. Many of the residents are families with lower incomes who have moved to this location because of its relative affordability. Residents are from a variety of ethno-cultural groups but are scattered and do not have any facilities for gathering or worshipping together.</p>
      <p>You have been approached by another worker in the area to work with her to help create a more supportive environment that will meet more of the residents' needs and develop positive social networks. You have just taken the OHCC Online Community Development Course and are excited at the prospect of putting the "10 Steps to Community Development" to into action.</p>

      <hr>Step 2. Listen to community members
      <p></p>
      <p>(a)&nbsp; How can you connect informally with community members?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(b)&nbsp; How will you introduce yourself?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(b) Where will you hold the visioning session?</p>

      <hr>Step 4: Assess community assets and resources, needs and issues

      <p>Briefly describe two methods you might use to assess the community's assets, resources, needs and/or issues.</p>

      <hr>Step 5: Help community members to recognize and articulate areas of concern and their causes.
      <p></p>
      <p>Many issues and needs were raised at the community visioning session, along with several suggestions of possible sources of financial and in-kind resources. Five residents and several service providers indicated they would be interested in helping to work towards improvements in their community.</p>
      <p>Your task is to follow up with those that indicated an interest in being involved and help them to process the results of the community visioning session. You will explore with them the areas of concern that were voiced, in more depth than was possible at the visioning session, and examine their root causes. You have decided to tackle this task by organizing a meeting.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(a) Who will you invite?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(b) How will you invite them?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(d) When and where will you hold the meeting?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(e) What do you hope will be the outcome of the meeting?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
      <hr>Step 6:&nbsp; Establish a "vehicle for change" 
      <p></p>
      <p>In order for the community change effort to be effective, there needs to be some organizational structure and processes in place. In this case, at an initial meeting, those that indicated an interest in working together to improve the community decided to form a community coalition, made up of both organizations and residents.</p>
      <p>(a) In addition to community residents, what (if any) organizations do you think should be recruited to join the coalition?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(b) What are some of the governing principles you think the coalition should adopt?&nbsp; (e.g. How are decisions made? Who can speak on behalf of the coalition? How are coalition members informed of meetings and actions taken on behalf of the coalition?)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
      <hr>Step 7: Develop an action plan
      <p></p>
      <p>For the purposes of this exercise, imagine that the coalition has selected a particular goal to pursue (for example, developing a welcoming and supportive community for newcomers to Canada, or establishing a park and playground within their community) Use the action planning chart below to identify what needs to be done, when, who should do it and what resources will be required.</p>

       </tbody>
      </table>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
      <hr>Step 8: Implement action plan
      <p></p>
      <p>It is likely that funds will be required to implement the action plan.</p>
      <p>(a) What are the risks, from a community development point of view, in accessing external funding and developing close working relationships with funding sources? How can the risks be lessened?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(c) Are there local funding sources that could be tapped?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
      <hr>Step 9:&nbsp; Evaluate results of actions
      <p></p>
      <p>The community coalition has worked hard with its many partners and supporters to meet their goal. How will you evaluate whether your project has been successful?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(a) What are your criteria for success?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(b) Who will be involved in the evaluation process?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(c) Using simple procedures, how will you assess the degree of success of your initiative?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(d) How will you assess the process of the initiative; i.e. how well the coalition functioned?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
      <hr>Step 10: Reflect and regroup
      <p></p>
      <p>(a) What activities will help the group to "wrap up" the project?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(b) Are there any "spin off" benefits or unintended outcomes of the project? (use your imagination)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(c) How will you assess whether there is interest or energy for tackling another area of concern from the list developed at the community visioning session?</p>

      <h1 class="book-heading">Benefits of Collaboration</h1> 
      <p><br>In almost any kind of community initiative, finding other groups and organizations with similar interests, that are willing to work with you on common issues or projects, is strategically advantageous. <br><br>Below is a list of the benefits that can result from collaborating with others:<br><br><strong>Synergy</strong>: The synergy created from working collaboratively will result in greater accomplishments than each group working on its own could ever hope to achieve. If you work separately, it will fragment the efforts and the resources, possibly leading to less accomplishment. <br><br><strong>Community Awareness:</strong> Increased participation leads to increased community awareness. By involving a number of organizations, your issue or message can be transmitted to a great many more people, and, through word-of-mouth with their associates, to an exponentially larger pool of people.<br><br><strong>Share resources:</strong> The sharing of resources and expertise can make daunting tasks more manageable. Also, it may be that you require technical expertise, knowledge or facilities that your own organization cannot provide.<br><br><strong>Overcome Obstacles: </strong>Obstacles faced by one group may be overcome by another group.<br>Effective Representation: A partnership, coalition or network has more power to influence policy than a single organization because a larger and broader section of the community is represented. <br><strong><br>Avoid Duplication:</strong> Working together can help ensure efforts and services aren’t being unnecessarily duplicated, and that there is an appropriate distribution of resources.<br><br><strong>Access to Constituents:</strong> Sometimes one partner will have a high degree of organizational capacity for planning and implementing programs, but has not developed a trusting relationship with the community it wishes to serve, such as people with disabilities, aboriginal groups, grass roots community groups or particular ethno-racial communities. They may benefit from partnering with others who serve as a bridge into the community. <br><strong><br>Access to funding sources: </strong>There may be grant opportunities for which your organization is not eligible, but one of your partners is. By working as a collaborative these funds can be accessed to support your initiative.</p>

      <h1 class="book-heading">Types of Collaborations</h1> 
      <p>There are many different types of collaborative arrangements, ranging from loose network affiliations to fully collaborative structures with complex and formal relationships. The following is one set of categories used to indicate the nature of the relationship among collaborative members. However, in reality, collaboratives frequently develop a mix of the various attributes outlined in the following descriptions.<br><br>(i)&nbsp; <strong>Networks</strong><br><br>Members of a network have informal ties to each other and non-hierarchical relationships. There are few expectations of members and no official obligations.&nbsp; Informal networks may emerge simply due to the clustering of people and activities, but frequently networks are deliberately established to promote the sharing of information, tools and resources among individuals and organizations with similar interests. <br><br>Networks have many benefits; they can:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>enhance communication, co-operation and mutual support among organizations and community members</li>
       <li>raise the standards and quality of services;</li>
       <li>encourage the development of new models of service; and</li>
       <li>provide opportunities to form strategic partnerships.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Networks generally do not carry out work, per se, although members may collaborate on tasks and activities, and so generally require relatively little investment in their development and maintenance. However, successful networks require a certain degree of coordination and management. Communication vehicles must be established and maintained, the network must be promoter to prospective members and members must be engaged. <br><br>The Ontario Health Promotion Resource System established a set of indicators of network effectiveness which may have relevance to other types of networks as well. They are: </p>
      <ul>
       <li>the extent to which the relationships established within the network contribute to the planning and implementation of new programs or activities and take advantage of new opportunities; </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li>the extent to which the members actually function as a network; [e.g., share information and resources, use common tools and templates, adopt similar administration and reporting procedures, use each others’ materials, make referrals to each other, link websites and otherwise interact with each other]; </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li>&nbsp;the range of services and supports provided by the network as a whole; </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li>the strength of the relationships between and among network members </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li>the extent to which individual members of the network perceive the benefits of their involvement [1]&nbsp; </li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>(ii) &nbsp; <strong>Alliances</strong><br><br>Alliances involve more formal relationships among organizations and individuals, and usually focused on a particular issue or mission. While it is unlikely that there will be legal obligations in place, there will be clear expectations around task performance, contributions and conduct. Alliances are often formed as a means of influencing policy; either to formulate a strong response to a new policy that is seen as detrimental, or to advocate for the development of a policy. <br><br>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Coalitions<br></strong><br>A coalition is formal relationship among more than two organizations and perhaps involving individual members as well, which enables them to work together on a specific issue or project. Quite often the coalition will have its own funds and staff, either allocated from members’ own organizational budgets and human resources, or funded by an external source.&nbsp; <br><br>There are three main types of coalitions [2]:&nbsp; </p>
      <ul>
       <li>Grassroots coalitions form in times of crisis to pressure political decision-makers to act. They are usually organized by volunteers and are political, controversial and short-lived. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li>&nbsp;Professional coalitions may form in time of crisis or as part of a long-term strategy to increase their power and influence. Usually a lead organization is established that contributes significant staff and financial resources.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Community-Based coalitions have broad community representation and involve both professionals and volunteers/grassroots leaders. They tend to be focused on positive action to improve conditions in community, worksites, schools or other local institutions. Often one agency takes a lead administrative role and seeks funding to support the coalition and its activities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>(iv)&nbsp; <strong>Partnerships</strong><br><br>In business, a partner is someone who shares both the risks and profits of a business venture.&nbsp; Partnerships between non-profit organizations can be defined in similar terms – it is a relationship in which the organizations share resources and responsibilities to achieve a common objective, as well as any resulting rewards or recognition. Partnerships are formal relationships that are defined through a written agreement or contract.&nbsp; <br><br>The Hamilton Public Library has posted a PowerPoint presentation on their website at <a href="http://www.myhamilton.ca/myhamilton/LibraryServices/AboutTheLibrary/keyreports/" title="http://www.myhamilton.ca/myhamilton/LibraryServices/AboutTheLibrary/keyreports/">http://www.myhamilton.ca/myhamilton/LibraryServices/AboutTheLibrary/keyr...</a><br>which shows a number of partnerships they have established and gives tips on developing and maintaining successful partnerships. According to the presentation partnership development requires:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 
       <li>effort &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </li> 
       <li>small steps</li> 
       <li>shared success&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li> 
       <li>trust&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li> 
       <li>respect&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Full Collaboration</strong><br><br>When organizations fully collaborate on an initiative, the collaboration takes on its own identity.&nbsp; In a full collaboration, the new entity will have its own budget, constitution or terms of reference, dedicated human resources and a plan of action. For example, walkON[3] is a community partnership including local Heart Health projects, municipalities, and public health Units formed to promote walkable communities by raising awareness and educating the public. walkON has its own website and produces its materials under the walkON logo. It has its own funding sources separate from those of the collaborating organizations.</p>

      <h1 class="book-heading">Collaborative Roles</h1> 
      <p>There are many different roles that organizations can play in terms of their relationship with each other, such as:</p>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Convener:</strong> initiates a public discussion of a community issue</li>
       <li><strong>Catalyst:</strong> provides initial leadership and credibility but is committed to a longer-term strategy&nbsp;</li>
       <li><strong>Conduit:</strong> acts as the “lead” organization in that it manages the necessary contractual and financial obligations that come with receiving grants.&nbsp; It is important that the conduit not be allowed to dominate the initiatives as a result of taking on this role</li>
       <li><strong>Funder: </strong>provides financial resources, and may also be actively involved in the design and evaluation of the project.&nbsp; A clear understanding of the scope and limit of their authority is required.</li>
       <li><strong>Technical Assistance Provider:</strong> provides data, technical information, professional opinions or particular skills</li>
       <li><strong>Capacity-Builder:</strong> provides resources and skills training to community members to increase their ability to effect change. Capacity-builders aim to increase skills, knowledge and resources, but also community power and ownership.</li>
       <li><strong>Partner:</strong> shares in risks, responsibility, investment and rewards.</li>
       <li><strong>Advocate:</strong> focuses on changing policy or systems</li>
       <li><strong>Community Organizer: </strong>interested in who is “at the table”; i.e. who is involved and who has decision-making power. The community organizer works to maximize community participation and to ensure that those who are traditionally excluded from decision-making are included as full partners in the process.</li>
       <li><strong>Facilitator: </strong>assists in community problem-solving process by liaising among various players and being a source of fairness, encouragement</li>
       <li><strong>Evaluator:</strong> provides information about how well the collaborative is performing and whether its objectives are being met. [4] </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="book-heading">Challenges of Collaboration</h1> 
      <p>While the vision of a collaborative may be very compelling, every day realities may pose considerable challenges and tensions. Before starting or joining a collaborative, it is important to have a clear understanding of the risks, challenges and expectations that are involved. Each organization has to assess the level of risk the collaborative entails to the organization, in terms of finances, reputation, time, energy and other “lost” opportunities, and decide if it is acceptable. You will want to have a clear understanding of the conditions for withdrawing from the collaborative, and be prepared to absorb any failures. What sounds good in theory may not work as well in practice, especially working within community settings where there are many variables beyond your control. <br><br>Probably the biggest challenge in developing and managing a successful collaborative is finding the time and energy to nurture the positive relationships required to function effectively, particularly in times of rapid change or increased pressure on resources. It is often commented that working collaboratively takes longer and is more complex, difficult and sometimes frustrating, but we may also develop superior solutions and have a greater impact.<br><br></p>

      <h1 class="book-heading">Factors That Contribute To Successful Collaborations</h1> 
      <p>The Ontario Prevention Clearinghouse (OPC) ( now known as Health Nexus) produced a tip sheet on “Dynamic Partnerships “in 1997 that provides reflections, references and resources about partnerships. It explains that “partnering with other organizations to support a common goal involves “an interdependence of elements along with increasing complexity that requires less competition and more crossing of boundaries and sectors”. <br><br>They identified eleven factors that contribute to successful partnerships and collaborations.<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>People</strong>: Organizations do not work together, people do – thus individual characteristics will be a factor in whether the collaborative is successful or not.&nbsp; Check out the “chemistry” between people and their level of commitment to the collaborative.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Vision</strong>: Create a shared vision and common goals that incorporate all of the members’ perspectives and interests, and identifies mutual needs that cannot be met by one organization alone.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Trust</strong>:&nbsp; Take some time to explore your common ground. “Trust is built through mutual respect for each person’s experience, knowledge and contribution. “ <br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Time</strong>: Do not give in to the pressure for speed and action.&nbsp; Getting to know each other in order to developing a solid partnership takes time, as does planning and implementation.<br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Planning</strong>:&nbsp; Working together effectively requires a great deal of planning. All aspects of the collaborative, including purpose, function, decision-making process, the risks and benefits to each member and anticipated results needs to be considered, agreed upon and committed to (usually by signing a written agreement). Subsequently, every meeting, every workplan, every approach to a prospective member or funder, has to be planned.<br><br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Communication</strong>: There needs to be a transparent flow of information among members, and mechanisms for ensuring that all members are kept up-to-date on matters relating to the collaborative and have clear means of voicing concerns and suggestions.<br><br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Learning Together</strong>: Partnerships involve learning about each other, about the issues or needs that are being addressed, and about how to work together effectively.<br><br>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Decision-Making</strong>: It is crucial that how decisions are made is agreed upon right at the start of the partnership and adhered to throughout its duration. Partners should also agree on a problem resolution process.&nbsp; Agreements regarding the investment of people, time and resources need to be negotiated and clearly understood by all partners.<br><br>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Leadership</strong>: There are many options for leadership; e.g. elect a Chair or Co-Chairs, or establish different roles for different members. It may be formal or informal. Shared leadership can renew energy and increase commitment. <br><br>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Technology</strong>: Electronic communication can enhance and support the work of the partnership by facilitating connections and opportunities for innovation. An assessment of current systems and technical capacities of each of the members is required before effective information and communications systems can be established.<br><br>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Flexibility</strong>: As circumstances change, one or more members may not be able to contribute to the extent originally intended, or may not be able to remain involved at all. The remaining members will have to make adjustments accordingly.</p>

      <h1 class="book-heading">Working Effectively Across Different Organizational Cultures</h1> 
      <p>Conflict within collaboratives is often inevitable, due to different organizational values, cultures, levels of experience and degree of expertise among organizations. These differences make it difficult to work in harmony. Despite common concerns, organizations have their own “take” on the problem, and their own set of assumptions and preferred solutions. They may also have different expectations around decision making processes, information flow, time commitments, and how power, authority and responsibility is shared. Collaborating organizations don’t need to have the same culture in order to be successful, but they do need to understand and accommodate differences among them. <br><br><strong>Questions that might be useful to ask before committing to the collaborative are: </strong></p>
      <ul>
       <li>Do partners have similar mandates? Do they overlap? Is there duplication?</li>
       <li>Is there a conflict of interest among any of the participating organizations or with the aims of the collaborative? For example, is there likely to competition for funds?</li>
       <li>How are decisions to be made?&nbsp;</li>
       <li>How will the work load be shared?</li>
       <li>What constraints does each of the partners have in terms of costs, political concerns and approval processes?</li>
       <li>What are the expectations in terms of time commitment; both in terms of the amount of time required for effective participation and whether there needs to be strict adherence to time frames; e.g. meetings stopping and staring on time, critical deadlines for task completion.&nbsp;</li>
       <li>Is there an expectation that some work will be handled by volunteers? How are they to be recruited? Who is responsible for their training and supervision? Are participating organizations or individuals expected to perform some work on their own time?</li>

         <p>In his book, <em>Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft,</em> published in 1887, <strong>Ferdinand </strong>Tönnies suggested that societies evolve from Gemeinschaft to Gesellschaft. Gemeinschaft (loosely translated as "community") is the earlier form, and is organized around family, village, and town. The economy is largely agricultural and political life is local. Gesellschaft societies are organized at the larger levels of metropolis and nation-state, and the economic system is based on trade and modern industry. Tönnies did not conceive of the evolution from Gemeinschaft to Gesellschaft in unilinear terms; any society always has to some degree both Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft.</p>
