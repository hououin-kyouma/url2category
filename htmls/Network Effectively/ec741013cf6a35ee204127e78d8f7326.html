       <p><strong><strong>FIN-650607, International Financial Management, 3cr</strong></strong></p> 
       <p>The learning objective of this course aims at having the students develop an understanding that with the world having become a global village, the essence of global corporate financial management is producing where it is most cost-effective, selling where it is most profitable, and sourcing capital where it is cheapest, without having to worry about national boundaries. Towards achieving this, the framework for this course emphasizes on learning international financial management tools and techniques that are designed to maximize shareholder wealth over time. The course will help students analyze the foreign exchange market with respect to purchasing power and interest rate parity conditions, foreign currency derivatives, risk management and hedging involving operating, transaction, and translation exposure management, and multinational capital budgeting and portfolio diversification.</p> 
       <p><strong>FIN-650608, Quantitative Methods in Finance, 3cr</strong></p> 
       <p>The purpose of this course is to expose students to modern data analysis with an emphasis on a specific domain of application: finance. Students are expected to have an understanding of basic statistics, since concepts such as random variables, expectation, correlation and statistical inference (estimation, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals) are fundamental to the analyses addressed in the course. It is also expected that students have a basic understanding of linear algebra. The course relies on real financial data and uses spreadsheets and statistical softwares to cover a range of topics, from exploratory data analysis techniques and simulations, to regression analysis methods, with a strong emphasis on their application.&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><strong>FIN-651700, Investment Analysis, 3cr</strong></p> 
       <p>The purpose of this course is to engage students with procedures and tools necessary to evaluate investment variables, determine value and analyze risk and return characteristics of financial assets namely, equity, fixed income securities, mutual and hedge funds and to study risk diversification and optimum portfolio analysis.The students will develop a better understanding of the investment environment, and the functioning of different asset classes and financial instruments, that include the money market, the bond market, the equity market, and financial derivatives.

       <p>Within this course, participants will explore the ways to use digital tools, devices, applications, and simulations (called “devices” herein) to engage diverse learners in the varied applications of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Within a common course framework, participants will study the devices of their particular interest, considering the educational needs of the intended audience or learners, finding educational and psychological solutions for challenges learners may have with these devices, and constructing instructional supports and assessment approaches to help their learners work productively with these devices. Throughout the course, participants will share their emerging ideas about effective instructional approaches, gaining insights from these peer interactions. Synchronous meetings occur periodically within this online environment. Participants are welcome from all STEM and healthcare areas if they need to ensure their intended audience is understanding and using these devices appropriately. Participants must supply their own device.</p> 
       <p><strong>EDU-681124, Socially-networked Learning: Understanding, Designing and Evaluating, 3cr</strong></p> 
       <p>The rapid advances in communication and learning technologies have opened new arenas for educators and communicators, however, a conceptual framework about the value and design of these new and rich type of interaction needs to be developed. Plus, for effective educational uses, one needs to assess what happens to the learners and learning and to evaluate the overall productivity of the socially networked environment itself.&nbsp; In this course, participants will study the research about various aspects of these emerging social networks, considering the sociology and the psychology of the individuals and interactions. Working then with their own needs, they will frame and design a social network to meet a learning or communication goal for their students or clientele, developing an implementation, assessment and evaluation plan and articulating a theoretical/conceptual framework to validate their design. (Participants can also choose to work on a project with the instructor.)&nbsp; Learning Outcomes: during this course participants will have an opportunity to: · examine the psychology, sociology, and assessment aspects of socially-networked learning as it is emerging in the world today;&nbsp; · locate social learning within scenarios relevant to their interest, researching ways these environments could be serving actual or emerging needs within these environments;&nbsp; · develop and conceptually-frame a socially-networked learning project for their own (or instructor) needs that determines ways to network, assess, and evaluate student or client learning.</p>

       <p>From the 19th century on in the U.S., the profession of medicinehas played an increasingly important role in naturalizing the social constructions of gender and sexuality. From the development of mid- 19th century gynecological surgeries and treatments to curb female sexual drives which were perceived as socially dangerous, through the forced sterilizations of the eugenics movement, to the involuntary treatment of intersex infants in the present, medicine has had an important role in regulating gender and reinforcing social gender roles. At the same time, medicine has had potentially liberatory effects on social sexual restraints and provided a public arena to contest repressive social practices. From the development of birth control to the women’s health movement, medicine has been used to reframe social debates on acceptable sexual beliefs and practices.&nbsp; This course satisfies one 3-credit elective requirement of the American Studies or the Women’s and Gender Studies advanced certificates.</p>
