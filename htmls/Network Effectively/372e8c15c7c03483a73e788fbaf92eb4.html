         <p> Every day, everyone at EY is part of building a better working world — for their clients, their families, their communities and themselves. Advisory builds a better working world by helping to strengthen industries, improve businesses and build trust and confidence in the capital markets. Everything we do — every process we help improve, every risk we identify, every interaction with a client or colleague — contributes to making the world work better.</p>
         <p> More than 42,000 EY professionals find ways to help clients respond to the outside forces that are fundamentally, and permanently, reshaping their worlds. We help them assess and protect their organizations, grow revenues, improve processes and innovate their businesses. We do this through a sharp focus on leadership, alignment, execution and adoption.</p>
         <p> Our Advisory service line works across many industry sectors to help clients in three distinct areas:</p>
         <p> <strong>Performance Improvement: We help clients design and improve their business processes.</strong><br> We help finance functions keep pace with evolving business priorities; sales and marketing functions attract and retain valuable customer relationships; and supply chains deliver lower costs, more revenue and more shareholder value. We also help our clients develop and implement their performance strategies, manage the complexities of implementing those strategies as well as help shape and shepherd the resulting change journeys.</p>
         <p><strong>Performance Technology: We help clients design and implement technologies that drive business performance.</strong><br> Cloud. Mobile. Big data. Analytics. Social media. These are more than buzz words. They represent a host of new technologies that are changing how organizations make decisions and manage information. We help our clients make sense of all of the existing and emerging technologies out there and help them use these technologies to their advantage.</p>
         <p><strong>Risk: We help clients manage risk while they improve their performance.</strong><br> We help clients evaluate, understand and manage risk and associated controls to improve business and technology performance, protect against known risks and understand the impact of emerging risk.</p>

          <h3 class="careers-question"> Tax sub-service lines</h3> 
          <div> 
           <p class="careers-answer"> At a high level, EY Tax breaks down into six different areas:</p> 
           <h4> Business Tax</h4> 
           <p> <img alt="EY - Business Tax" assetid="MD-USDD-9ZYT4E" border="0" class="borderimage" height="81" src="/Media/vwLUImages/14H02584_RF_Abacus_144x81/$FILE/14H02584_RF_Abacus_144x81.jpg" title="EY - Business Tax" width="144"></p> 
           <p> In our business tax service, you’ll work with clients to help build sustainable tax strategies, provide deep accounting and compliance knowledge, help clients assess, improve and monitor their tax function’s process, controls and risk management and support clients in effectively managing relationships with tax authorities.</p> 
           <h4> Global Compliance and Reporting</h4> 
           <p> <img alt="EY - Global Compliance and Reporting" assetid="MD-USDD-9ZYT5V" border="0" class="borderimage" height="81" src="/Media/vwLUImages/14H02874_RF_Night-on-busy-street_144x81/$FILE/14H02874_RF_Night-on-busy-street_144x81.jpg" title="EY - Global Compliance and Reporting" width="144"></p> 
           <p> Compliance and reporting make huge demands on tax and finance functions today. In our global compliance and reporting practice, you’ll help clients reduce risk and inefficiencies and improve value cost-effectively. You’ll combine strong, local compliance and accounting experience with EY’s next-generation global data management model, giving clients an integrated, consistent, quality service that unlocks the potential of your compliance function, with tax compliance, statutory accounts preparation and tax accounting calculation support.</p> 
           <h4> Indirect Tax</h4> 
           <p> <img alt="EY - Indirect Tax" assetid="MD-USDD-9ZYT6X" border="0" class="borderimage" height="81" src="/Media/vwLUImages/14H04253_RF_Buildings-at-night_144x81/$FILE/14H04253_RF_Buildings-at-night_144x81.jpg" title="EY - Indirect Tax" width="144"></p> 
           <p> Indirect taxes, ranging from VAT and customs duties to environmental levies, affect a company’s entire supply chain and financial system. They pose unique challenges to multi-national tax functions, since they must be managed accurately and in real time. These often invisible taxes can have significant impacts — on cash flow, absolute costs and risk exposures. As part of our Indirect Tax team, you’ll advise clients on these and other cross-border issues. You’ll also bring a global perspective to helping clients identify potential risk areas and sustainable planning.</p> 
           <h4> International Tax Services</h4> 
           <p> <img alt="EY - International Tax Services" assetid="MD-USDD-9ZYT7X" border="0" class="borderimage" height="81" src="/Media/vwLUImages/14H02255_RF_Billboards-on-buildings_144x81/$FILE/14H02255_RF_Billboards-on-buildings_144x81.jpg" title="EY - International Tax Services" width="144"></p> 
           <p> Chief financial officers and tax directors of multinationals are operating in an environment of intense scrutiny and challenge. Transactions, inter-company pricing, supply chains, structuring and funding are increasingly under the spotlight. More than ever, executives are looking to align their global tax position with their overall business strategy, to be competitive and provide value to shareholders. In our International tax services you’ll help clients manage their business tax responsibilities including managing global tax risks and meeting cross-border reporting obligations. You'll help them manage global operational changes and transactions, capitalization and repatriation issues, transfer pricing and supply chain — from forward planning, through reporting, to maintaining effective relationships with the tax authorities.</p> 
           <h4> Transaction Tax</h4> 
           <p> <img alt="EY - Transaction Tax" assetid="MD-USDD-9ZYT8Y" border="0" class="borderimage" height="81" src="/Media/vwLUImages/14H03691_RF_Analyzing-graph_144x81/$FILE/14H03691_RF_Analyzing-graph_144x81.jpg" title="EY - Transaction Tax" width="144"></p> 
           <p> Every transaction has tax implications, whether it’s an acquisition, disposal, carve outs, refinancing, restructuring or public offering. In our transaction tax service, you’ll help clients understand and plan for these implications, mitigating transaction risk, enhancing client opportunity within the deal and providing crucial negotiation insights. You will work with clients throughout the transaction life cycle, from initial due diligence through post-deal implementation, helping clients achieve their commercial and strategic objectives.</p> 
           <h4> Human Capital</h4> 
           <p> <img alt="EY - Human Capital" assetid="MD-USDD-9ZYTA4" border="0" class="borderimage" height="81" src="/Media/vwLUImages/14H01806_RF_Pedestrian-crossing_144x81/$FILE/14H01806_RF_Pedestrian-crossing_144x81.jpg" title="EY - Human Capital" width="144"></p> 
           <p> As part of the Human Capital team, you’ll assist clients with the design and implementation of total reward strategies to engage their people and drive the organization’s business strategy. You'll also help clients manage HR compliance and risk, HR and payroll transformation, as well as technology advisory services and project management. You'll work with clients to integrate the people agenda into clients’ business strategy, helping them improve their businesses in the evolving global economy and realize sustainable economic growth.</p>

          <h3 class="careers-question"> Diversified paths</h3> 
          <div> 
           <p class="careers-answer"> EY offers a unique opportunity for you to learn about EY Tax while balancing both the breadth and depth of your experience.

          <div> 
           <p class="careers-answer"> We do hire some candidates directly into one of our niche tax specialty areas. They seek candidates with a specific skill set, and the nature of their day-to-day work means candidates hired into these niche areas benefit from receiving specialized and focused training and experiences as opposed to receiving a broader, diversified background. Learning and experience requirements are different for each focused path and roles require different types of certifications (for example, HR certification). Examples of focused paths we most commonly recruit for on campus include our National Tax Department and Transfer Pricing. Please see your recruiter for more information on the focused paths in our Tax practice.</p>

These professionals are among the country's top tax practitioners, and many of them have held policy-making positions at the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The combination of knowledge, government experience, and transactional work forms the basis for helping clients evaluate increasingly complex tax laws and implement intricate M&amp;A transactions.</p> 
           <p> As a member of the National M&amp;A Tax team, you’ll work directly with client and firm professionals, to perform tax technical research and analysis as part of the client service team in multiple client engagements. You will also deliver tax advice to the firm’s M&amp;A clients and other tax professionals located in various Ernst &amp; Young LLP offices.</p>
