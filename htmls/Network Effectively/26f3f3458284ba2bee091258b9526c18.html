        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it. <br> � Herbert Simon</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> The nation that makes a great distinction between its scholars and its warriors<br> will have its thinking done by cowards and its fighting done by fools.<br> � Thucydides</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> Fantasy, abandoned by reason, produces impossible monsters; united with it, she is the mother of the arts and the origin of marvels.<br> � Goya</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> When a task cannot be partitioned because of sequential constraints, the application of more effort has no effect on the schedule. The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.<br> � Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> Some ideas are so stupid that only intellectuals could believe them.<br> � George Orwell</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> Intelligence is like a four-wheel drive. It allows you to get stuck in more remote places.<br> � Garrison Keillor </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> Do one thing every day that scares you.<br> � Eleanor Roosevelt </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> My ability to keep cool in a crisis is based entirely on not knowing all the facts.<br> � Garrison Keillor </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> The one common experience of all humanity is the challenge of problems.<br> � R. Buckminster Fuller </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. <br>We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.<br> � Albert Einstein </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> The development of general ability for independent thinking and judgment should always be placed foremost, not the acquisition of special knowledge. It a person masters the fundamentals of his subject and has learned to think and work independently, he will surely find his way and besides will better be able to adapt himself to progress and changes than the person whose training principally consists in the acquiring of detailed knowledge.<br> � Albert Einstein, in <em>Ideas and Opinions</em>, p. 62 </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> It is not enough to teach a man a speciality. Through it he may become a kind of useful machine but not a harmoniously developed personality. It is essential that the student acquire an understanding of and a lively feeling for values. He must acquire a vivid sense of the beautiful and of the morally good. Otherwise he � with his specialized knowledge � more closely resembles a well trained dog than a harmoniously developed person. He must learn to understand the motives of human beings, their illusions, and their sufferings in order to acquire a proper relationship to the individual fellow-men and to the community�Overemphasis on the competitive system and premature specialization on the ground of immediate usefulness kill the spirit on which all cultural life depends, specialized knowledge included. It is also vital to a valuable education that independent critical thinking be developed in the young human being, a development that is greatly jeopardized by overburdening him with too much and with too varied subjects. Overburdening necessarily leads to superficiality.<br> � Albert Einstein, in <em>Ideas and Opinions</em>, p. 66-67 </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful.<br> � Samuel Johnson </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it.<br> � Samuel Johnson </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> Iron rusts from disuse, <br>stagnant water loses its purity and in cold weather becomes frozen; <br>so does inaction sap the vigors of the mind.<br> � Leonardo da Vinci </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is the probable reason why so few engage in it.<br> � Henry Ford </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> In the field of observation, chance favors the prepared mind.<br> � Louis Pasteur </font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.<br> � T. S. Eliot</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1"> The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.<br> ... <br> A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. � 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' � Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. <br> � Ralph Waldo Emerson, in his essay �Self-Reliance�</font></p>

In doing so, this essay will propose principles of critical and creative thinking applicable to the military profession to provide a common vocabulary that describes the type of thinking we do.

           <ul> 
            <li>Another sign of bad strategy is fuzzy strategic objectives. One form this problem can take is a scrambled mess of things to accomplish�a dog�s dinner of goals. A long list of things to do, often mislabeled as strategies or objectives, is not a strategy. It is just a list of things to do. Such lists usually grow out of planning meetings in which a wide variety of stakeholders suggest things they would like to see accomplished. Rather than focus on a few important items, the group sweeps the whole day�s collection into the strategic plan. Then, in recognition that it is a dog�s dinner, the label �long term� is added, implying that none of these things need be done today. </li>
            <li>Bad strategy has many roots, but I�ll focus on two here: the inability to choose and template-style planning�filling in the blanks with �vision, mission, values, strategies.� </li>
           </ul> <p> </p></li>

           <ul> 
            <li>How we got to the point where our best and brightest are able to offer only tired and uncreative strategies is not as important as what we need to do now. We must develop, nurture, and promote strategic thinkers. We define <em>strategic thinkers</em> as those officers who understand the inherent linkages between the abstract and concrete, between thinking and doing, and who eschew old checklists for new ideas and apply those ideas to potential future situations. </li>
            <li>The Air Force should seek out those officers who have a balanced brain�those who can not only intuit well and rapidly, but who also understand when it may be necessary to look for theories that can be generalized. Instead, the Service teaches �people, processes, and products� that make up the Air Operations Center at its command and staff college. </li>
            <li>There is no career path for strategists or strategic thinkers, and indeed there appears to be a trend away from intellectualism. </li>
            <li>Rather than disdaining intellectualism, senior leaders should be encouraged to read recent scholarship on strategic decisionmaking and ask themselves if they can learn something there. In addition to the long list of histories of command and leadership, Air Force senior leaders should have to read Scott Page�s <em>The Difference</em>, Malcolm Gladwell�s <em>Blink</em> and <em>Outliers</em>, James Surowiecki�s <em>The Wisdom of Crowds</em>, and most importantly, Alec Fisher�s <em>The Logic of Real Arguments</em>. </li>
            <li>The balance between Gladwell and Surowiecki should be lessons that all senior officers learn en route to becoming strategists. Giovanni Gavetti and Jan Rivkin, in <em>How Strategists Really Think</em>, tell us that one of the greatest mistakes leaders make is applying the wrong experiential analogies to the situation at hand. In today�s military, senior leaders disdain empirical evidence for �gut-based� decisions made quickly in high-visibility situations. As Watts mentions, too many of our leaders go on experience and apply lessons from the past to the problem at hand. The current problem, however, is rarely like any they previously faced; thus, the lessons they bring forward are not relevant. Experience is important, but for senior leadership we should seek out those who can adapt to the situation no matter what it is. Effective strategists also use academic and intellectual rigor en route to solving problems�not just effective gut-checking. </li>
            <li>We mentioned earlier the trend toward relying on experience rather than critical thinking and inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is not hard merely for military officers, but for almost everyone. In Taleb�s <em>The Black Swan</em>, he argues that because humans rely so much on past experience, they cannot conceive of a situation that has not happened before. </li>
            <li>Inductive reasoning is only one attribute of successful strategists. They must also exhibit: 
             <ul> 
              <li>creativity </li>
              <li>curiosity </li>
              <li>confidence </li>
              <li>high intelligence without subject fixation </li>
              <li>ability to collate and make sense out of massive amounts of data </li>
              <li>great and diverse intellect </li>
              <li>thorough knowledge of the means </li>
              <li>intuitive understanding of the ends. </li>
             </ul> </li>
            <li>We place creativity at the top because crafting strategies, like war itself, is an art. We posit that educating an officer to be a strategist is for naught if the first four traits are not present. </li>
            <li>We must demand more of our officers�not in terms of time or energy (most give more than their fair share whether they have it or not), but in terms of how they <em>think</em>. </li>
            <li>Let us be clear on one point: deductive thinking is required in campaign planning and in airpower theory, especially when it comes to establishing quantifiable metrics and measuring against them. Pressed up against the realities of war, deductive thinkers do a great job killing the enemy, but it is inductive thinkers who master how to discourage enemy forces from wanting to continue to fight. And it is inductive thinkers who are best able to determine how to achieve victory on a variety of battlefields against innumerable conflicts and challenges. The metrics to measure each are very different. One is an empirical count while the other cannot be measured. </li>

            <li>Ideas and the ability to generate them seem increasingly likely, in fact, to be more important than weapons, economic potential, diplomatic acumen, or technological advantage in determining who exercises global leadership and enjoys superpower status. Thus it is imperative to develop, nurture, and engage strategic thinkers at all levels�critical, creative, broadgauged visionaries with the intellect to dissect the status quo, grasp the big picture, discern important relationships among events, generate imaginative possibilities for action, and operate easily in the conceptual realm. </li>
            <li>Almost by definition, strategic thinkers are broadly educated, not narrowly trained. They seek not simply direction but to grapple with the underlying questions of whether, why, and what if. </li>
            <li>A broad-based education expands�and fuels the self-guided growth of�one�s horizons. It develops the intellect and inculcates the spirit of inquiry for a lifelong pursuit of learning. The measure of education, far from being the level or even the sum of formal schooling, rests more in the degree of open-mindedness and active mental engagement it engenders. </li>

           <ul> 
            <li>The current demand by the military for welldefined objectives is eloquent evidence of how far our thinking has drifted toward the tactical domain. The insistence on operationally planning based on enemy capabilities, while tactically prudent, is the antithesis of strategic thinking, which should concentrate on enemy vulnerabilities. Although defeating enemy forces may sometimes be necessary to achieve our objectives, it is not always the Nation�s or the military�s best option. </li>

              <li>Given the notable shortcomings many ascribe to U.S. strategic thinking over the last decade -- some deeply involving senior military leaders -- we must seriously question whether our program of PME today is on the right track. In my estimation, we are drifting off course, and if uncorrected, our marked advantage in the intellectual capital of warfare, in the face of an increasingly uncertain future, is at risk. </li>
              <li>Thus, for almost all senior officers -- all our generals and admirals -- the final fifteen to twenty years of their career is almost entirely largely lacking in extended developmental experiences. This fact becomes more troubling when correlated with the reality that decision-making and complexity at the senior levels -- especially regarding strategic and grand strategic issues -- is immensely more complex and uncertain than the relatively simpler worlds of tactics and operations. So-called "wicked problems" unresponsive to set-piece solutions abound. </li>

              <li>The cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan suggests that the United States can no longer afford an approach resting on the comfortable assumption that commanders can acquire skills on the fly to deal with the new and different complexities that each conflict will bring in its wake. As General James Mattis suggested in an email to a professor at National War College, �We have been fighting on this planet for 5,000 years and we should take advantage of that experience. �Winging it� and filling body bags as we sort out what works reminds us of the moral dictates and the cost of competence in our profession.� The depressing story of our flawed efforts to handle a burgeoning insurgency during the post-invasion period in Iraq suggests that too many senior officers had never studied the lessons of Vietnam, much less the experiences of the British in their efforts to defeat the 1920 insurgency in Iraq. </li>

One should note that these are not quite the same thing. Only a small number of officers will develop into strategists of the first rank, but these are so important that the PME system must do as much as it can to encourage them to develop their talents to the maximum degree possible. </li>

            <li>A leader can develop more effective strategic thinking skills. This is done by exploiting any opportunity to better understand yourself, how you think about complex problems, and how to go about making decisions. This understanding of yourself is critical, since this information that forms the foundation for developing your strategic thinking capabilities necessary in the strategic environment. The more you understand yourself, the more control you have over both the process, and the products you produce. </li>
            <li>Virtually all of you will be required to serve in strategic environments. This means there will be many opportunities for you to function as a strategic thinker or advisor. You must, therefore, continue to develop a new and broader set of thinking skills. The SLDM course, and the overall ICAF experience have been designed to help you understand and develop effective strategic thinking skills to solve the complex, fast changing, unstructured problems you will soon encounter. </li>

As is often quoted, �we�re out of money, its time to think�. We as Marines, especially the Staff NCOs and company grade officers, need to do better at taking responsibility for our own organization. The following are some ideas of how Disruptive Thinkers can be more effective. [ed. - all are expanded in the article] 
             <ul> 
              <li>Be a Disruptive Doer, not just a Disruptive Thinker. </li>
              <li>Be ready for a bureaucratic knife fight. </li>
              <li>Don�t forget that the Marine Corps is a warfighting institution, not a think tank. </li>
              <li>Sometimes you can do more good outside of the military. </li>
             </ul> </li>
            <li>"With that being said, some responsibility does lie on leadership. We do a very poor job at leveraging our best minds and our most talented leaders. The Marine Corps leadership can change this in several different ways: 
             <ul> 
              <li>Bring �centralized command, decentralized control� back to the Marine Corps. Innovation is often a bottom up process, where those closest to the fight have the best solutions. Giving subordinate commanders flexibility to make these decisions will allow the most creative junior leaders to develop innovative solutions to existing problems. </li>
              <li>Strive to keep the best and brightest officers and SNCOs in the Marine Corps. ... If you want effective Colonels and Generals you need to keep effective Lieutenants and Captains. </li>

              <li>The crowd must be diverse, which allows the individual members to bring different pieces of relevant information to the table. </li>
              <li>It needs to be decentralized so that no individual member is dictating what the answer should be. </li>
              <li>It needs a mechanism for distilling the group�s opinion into a collective verdict. </li>
              <li>The individual crowd members have to be independent, so they remain true to their own information and perspective while not worrying about what the other members of the group think of them. </li>
             </ul> </li>
            <li>Surowiecki explains: "The paradox of the wisdom of crowds is that the best group decisions come from lots of independent individual decisions." </li>

           <ul> 
            <li>We live in an interconnected world where information is becoming the currency of the realm. According to UC Berkeley School of Information we produce more than 550,000 Terabytes of data each year and our current adversaries are leveraging this wealth of information into concrete operational advantages better then we can. By shying away from traditional operational security principles and moving to what could be described as open source warfare, they can adapt more quickly to a given situation. A striking example of open source can be found in the Iraqi insurgency. It took only 12 months to reach (and surpass) capabilities for the deployment of the full spectrum of IEDs in Iraq that took over 30 years for the IRA to achieve under more rigorous operational security (OPSEC) conditions in Ulster. </li>
            <li>This paper will propose that a concept of open source warfare will be far more effective in supporting a campaign design methodology during complex emergencies as opposed to the traditional compartmentalized approach favoured in today�s military planning process. First of all, we will look where this concept can be employed and why it would work. Having identified where open source can be useful for the military, we will turn our attention to the need of changing our understanding of OPSEC. Finally, we will propose an open source planning model which will allow us to better leverage information during campaign design and execution. </li>

           <ul> 
            <li>Outliers are data and hypotheses that analysts may too quickly dismiss. They may be the imaginative, even prescient analyses policymakers cannot bring themselves to believe. Intelligence analysts generally possess healthy doses of skepticism to help them avoid the pitfalls of hubris and self-delusion, but, sadly, this is insufficient, for the outliers that ultimately prove to be the seeds of surprise are outlandish, unthinkable, and wholly anomalous. </li>
            <li>Our interest in outliers was born out of Internet-based surveying that Clint Watts undertook on 2 January 2011. The purpose of that survey was to test the ability of crowds to make accurate hypotheses about future counterterrorism issues in the event of Usama Bin Laden�s death. </li>

            <li>This is an example of crowdsourcing, collaboration, game mechanics and social networking at its best. Instead of doing each of these activities in isolation, these elements were brought together as a powerful tool to solve a real world problem. �The researchers noted that much attention has been given to the possibilities of crowd-sourcing and game playing in scientific discovery. Their results indicate the potential for integrating online video games into real-world science.� </li>
            <li>In cases where we have the basics of social/new media covered, let�s keep advancing and level up to thinking about game mechanics as another tool in our problem solving toolbox.

              <br>3. "essence" and "form" are the two characteristics of a solid collaboration.

            <li>Some of the critical practices and principles for successful wikis are listed below. 
             <ul> 
              <li>Wikis work best when they solve a problem that is evident to most of a group. </li>
              <li>Wiki use needs to replace an existing work process, not add to work. </li>
              <li>Wikis need advocates and advertising. </li>
              <li>Seeding the wiki with valuable content helps jump-start the process; with a blank page, no one knows where to start. </li>
              <li>Gradual growth is fine, and starting small helps a core group of users become accustomed to the wiki (think pilot study). </li>
              <li>A wiki that serves a niche need is okay; it does not need to be all things to all people. </li>

            <li>This report presents inquiry based learning (IBL) as an instructional strategy addressing the Army�s need for training flexible and adaptive leaders. Distinguishing tenets of IBL are characterized in contrast to the Army�s current direct instruction strategy. Elements of IBL, including characterization of the orienting problem, learner support by the instructor, and assessment of learner outcomes are outlined. Considerations for developing an IBL curriculum are addressed, and details of an example of an Army IBL course of instruction are provided. </li>

           <ul> 
            <li>This paper reports a series of research efforts embodied in the U.S. Army�s Think Like a Commander training program. The work is interesting because it seeks to train a cognitive behavior � thinking � using methods that have traditionally been applied to training more observable and measurable behaviors, e.g., marksmanship and gunnery, sports performance. In short, it does not greatly respect a traditional distinction between such things as physical movements, perceptions, and cognitions when it comes to training, rather treats these all as behaviors that are amenable to the same training methods and principles. Deliberate practice techniques were applied to develop exercises to train the task of adaptive thinking in tactical situations. </li>

            <li>Change in the College comes in how we accomplish our educational mission, as well as within the content of our courses. This change is an active, evolutionary educational process that drives the institution to reexamine itself on a frequent basis. The operational environment is dramatically different than in previous times. Additionally, there has been a tremendous growth in understanding of adult learning and professional education, and CGSC is leveraging this new science. We are educating a different generation of emerging leaders who bring incredible experience to the classroom to share. Our teaching methods account for this shift in our students� background and experience. The most obvious difference over the previous 30 years is that more than 90 percent of our Army students have recent combat experience and nearly 70 percent have multiple combat tours. Based on this background, and the ever-changing operating environment that is our world, it is easy to see that change remains a constant in the process of leader development and education for the Army. </li>

"Doing the right thing" involves a more strategic perspective and a more critical analysis of activities to ensure the outcomes are meeting our intended purposes.

            <li>The ability to be creative, or think creatively, has long been recognized as a core component to successful leadership at all levels of command. Especially at the strategic level, the ability to think creatively and adapt to changing circumstances is often the difference between life and death, victory and defeat. ... And despite general agreement to this fact by most senior leaders, the military on the whole is ill-equipped for producing leaders who are adaptable, flexible, and who can think creatively. Rather, its personnel makeup, focus on operations, and sheer bureaucracy all combine to create and reward leaders who are risk-averse, conformists, and good at maintaining the status quo. </li>

                <li>Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) has published "The Innovator's Guide," Aug. 29, to help innovators of all ages - but particularly the Navy's junior leaders - become more innovative and facilitate the transformation of good ideas into real warfighting capabilities. </li>
                <li> As the <a href="https://www.nwdc.navy.mil/ncfi/">Navy Center for Innovation</a>, NWDC is spearheading a campaign to reinvigorate a culture of innovation within the Navy, and the guide is an important component of that endeavor. </li>
                <li>In addition to defining innovation and why it is important, the guide provides advice on how to identify and define problems that need solving, proven techniques for finding creative solutions, and how to move these ideas through a large organization to drive towards implementation. </li>
                <li>"Junior leaders are often uniquely positioned to recognize emerging problems, and employ new technologies to solve them. It's up to us to give them the tools and the open channels to be successful," said Rear Adm. Terry B. Kraft, commander, NWDC. </li>
                <li>In his introduction, Kraft challenges the junior leaders to think deeply, question continuously, debate vigorously, read broadly, write boldly and never give up on a good idea. </li>

            <li>A military�s ability to adapt its organization, doctrine, and technology strategy to meet the threats of its time influences the state�s capacity to maintain great power status. This thesis uses a historical overview of military innovation among great powers throughout history to draw lessons for the U.S. military today. </li>
            <li>... Finally, and most importantly, this study finds it essential to foster a climate and institutional culture receptive to innovation. </li>
            <li>A true meritocracy would allow leaders to promote the most promising soldiers and officers despite their inability to meet any time-in-service requirements. The "year-group" promotion system codifies a rigid bureaucratic structure that ensures slow change and little innovation. </li>
           </ul> <p> <a name="powerpoint"></a> </p></li>
          <li><img src="graphics/spiffy.gif" alt="spiffy"> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=How+PowerPoint+Stifles+Understanding%2C+Creativity%2C+and+Innovation+Within+Your+Organization+%7C+Small+Wars+Journal">How PowerPoint Stifles Understanding, Creativity, and Innovation Within Your Organization</a>, by Zweibelson, in <em>Small Wars Journal</em>, 4 Sep 2012 - includes eight recommendations at the end, to "restore the briefer as a critical thinker" 
           <ul> 
            <li>PowerPoint provides a useful vehicle for sharing and developing concepts among military professionals in a variety of venues. Unfortunately, the U.S. military tends to lose track of the supportive context for PowerPoint and instead shackles organizations to institutional processes and rigid �group-think.� We tend to burden our military professionals with an exhausting and high-maintenance requirement to churn out repetitive and non-explanatory slide decks for nearly every conceivable information requirement. Rarely do we conduct a meeting without the ever-present bright projection of PowerPoint upon a screen. </li>
            <li>When you attend a briefing and the majority of slides and material attempt to reduce, measure, categorize, or describe something, we are often merely admiring the problem. </li>
            <li>Instead of thinking about why something is occurring, we are usually required to answer precise information that satisfies a descriptive (WHAT-centric) procedure instead of a critical line of inquiry. Many military professionals refer to this as �feeding the beast� in PowerPoint-centric organizations, where we openly acknowledge that our own hierarchy often demands volumes of often meaningless or irrelevant information for illusionary pretexts. If descriptive thinking blinds your organization to critical and creative thinking, then PowerPoint is the drug of choice for continuing the reductionist and highly tacticized mentality across an organization that fears uncertainty. </li>
            <li>Additionally, a recent trend of cramming four slides onto one �quad chart� slide is another work-around that compresses a larger slide show into fewer yet more cluttered slides and supports the �quantity over quality� tension. This recent staff technique defeats the purpose of a quadrant chart that uses two separate tensions in an overlapping geometric structure to demonstrate patterns and explore complex relationships. �Quad charts� are not interrelated if you apply one simple test. By removing one quadrant of a true �quad chart�, you will render the entire slide incomplete. Each quadrant in a quad chart should systemically relate to the other quadrants in terms of context. If you are only removing one component while the three remaining quadrants maintain their coherence, your staff has merely shoved ten pounds of dirt into a five pound bag for you, by condensing four slides into one. This reduces total slide numbers, but does little to improve organizational learning. </li>
            <li>Many military organizations use �read-ahead� packets that provide an advanced copy of the PowerPoint briefing slides in advance of the briefing. In theory, this implies an alternate route for information sharing that, when combined with a briefing, could function in tandem. In practice, this requires two commitments that are rarely met. First, all attendees must endeavor to actually read the �read-ahead� packet. This prepares an audience to enter a briefing cognizant of the topics, context, and prepared to offer relevant discourse to drive emergent thought. Secondly, the briefer must resist using any slides in the �read-ahead� except for ancillary or expository reasons during the brief. Simply following the exact slide format as the �read-ahead� drags those that invested time to read it earlier back through redundant information, and reward those that came to the meeting unprepared. </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>Many organizations live and die by good new ideas. The challenge they face is to cultivate good ideas by giving innovators just the right blend of freedom and support. One simple approach that is not taken often enough is to let the innovators themselves decide how the organization can help them develop their ideas. A manager asking, �What do you need from me?� has a good chance of finding the sweet spot between no support (�Do what you want as long as I don�t know about it�) and idea-killing interference. </li>

               <ul> 
                <li>Wikis work best when they solve a problem that is evident to most of a group. </li>
                <li>Wiki use needs to replace an existing work process, not add to work. </li>
                <li>Wikis need advocates and advertising. </li>
                <li>Seeding the wiki with valuable content helps jump-start the process; with a blank page, no one knows where to start. </li>
                <li>Gradual growth is fine, and starting small helps a core group of users become accustomed to the wiki (think pilot study). </li>
                <li>A wiki that serves a niche need is okay; it does not need to be all things to all people. </li>

            <li>Leadership must be committed to learning, underwrite experimentation, and create an environment that generates creative thought and innovation. Doctrine must incorporate more aspects of innovation, creative and critical thinking and innovative leadership.

The most critical area the Army must focus change in is within Professional Military Education for field grade officers. </li>

           <ul> 
            <li>Field Manual 1-0, The Army, states that �Army leaders are continuing to foster creative thinking.� They are �challenging inflexible ways of thinking, removing impediments to institutional innovation, and underwriting the risks associated with bold change.� </li>
            <li>Perhaps this statement is true, but given the contemporary use of the word �innovation,� it is also meaningless. Claiming to be innovative carries about as much weight as declaring a love for puppies; it�s easy to say and unpopular to challenge. When words represent some indistinct idea, they are susceptible to reinvention or distortion with potentially significant unintended consequences. </li>

           <ul> 
            <li>Still, I worry that our inability to match the achievements of the 1960s space program might be symptomatic of a general failure of our society to get big things done. </li>
            <li>Innovation can�t happen without accepting the risk that it might fail. The vast and radical innovations of the mid-20th century took place in a world that, in retrospect, looks insanely dangerous and unstable. </li>
            <li>Today�s belief in ineluctable certainty is the true innovation-killer of our age. In this environment, the best an audacious manager can do is to develop small improvements to existing systems�climbing the hill, as it were, toward a local maximum, trimming fat, eking out the occasional tiny innovation�like city planners painting bicycle lanes on the streets as a gesture toward solving our energy problems. Any strategy that involves crossing a valley�accepting short-term losses to reach a higher hill in the distance�will soon be brought to a halt by the demands of a system that celebrates short-term gains and tolerates stagnation, but condemns anything else as failure. In short, a world where big stuff can never get done. </li>

In doing so, this essay will propose principles of critical and creative thinking applicable to the military profession to provide a common vocabulary that describes the type of thinking we do. To expand and improve critical and creative thinking, military professionals need a common vocabulary that accurately describes the very thinking we are to expand and improve on. </li>

              <li>Sir Ken Robinson outlines 3 principles crucial for the human mind to flourish -- and how current education culture works against them. In a funny, stirring talk he tells us how to get out of the educational "death valley" we now face, and how to nurture our youngest generations with a climate of possibility. </li>
              <li>"There are three principles on which human life flourishes, and they are contradicted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor and most students have to endure." 
               <ul> 
                <li>"The first is this, that human beings are naturally different and diverse." 
                 <ul> 
                  <li>Education under No Child Left Behind is based on not diversity but conformity. What schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement. </li>
                 </ul> </li>
                <li>"The second principle that drives human life flourishing is curiosity." 
                 <ul> 
                  <li>So in place of curiosity, what we have is a culture of compliance. Our children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms rather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity. </li>
                 </ul> </li>
                <li>"And the third principle is this: that human life is inherently creative." 
                 <ul> 
                  <li>We all create our own lives through this restless process of imagining alternatives and possibilities, and what one of the roles of education is to awaken and develop these powers of creativity. Instead, what we have is a culture of standardization. </li>

              <li>he states that everyone is creative; the important thing is to "ship" (your product, i.e., do something with your idea) </li>

              <li>"A researcher at the London think tank Demos, Charles Leadbeater was early to notice the rise of "amateur innovation" -- great ideas from outside the traditional walls, from people who suddenly have the tools to collaborate, innovate and make their expertise known." </li>

           <ul> 
            <li>Although military technology is increasingly available and affordable, not all states have the capacity to improve military effectiveness by acquiring hardware. Integrative difficulties � in command structures, doctrine and tactics, training, and support � are common in the developing world, and many states will have to find some level of innovation to overcome such difficulties if they are to use military technologies effectively. This annotated briefing documents a research effort aimed at understanding and predicting how militaries may improve their battlefield effectiveness. The briefing first analyzes military innovation conceptually and then formulates a framework for predicting the likelihood of innovative success. The research synthesizes a broad literature on innovation and provides a useful tool for assessing future military developments. </li>

           <ul> 
            <li>The following pages discuss why it is so hard for Army senior leaders to change their minds. We do this by first introducing the concept of frames of reference and then discuss how neuroscience sheds some light on why changing one�s mind is not so easy. We then examine the role of organizational variables on this process. Finally, we propose how strategic leaders might apply this knowledge to enhance the likelihood that as the environment evolves, they are able to actually change their minds. </li>
            <li>In large hierarchical organizations such as the Army, consistency of thought is the norm, and not the exception. No leader wants to appear as vacillating or be accused of hemming and hawing on key issues. Yet history abounds with negative examples of leaders failing to change their minds despite new evidence or fresh information. </li>

            <li>A series of experiments on more than 300 people from the U.S. and Korea found that thinking in a second language reduced deep-seated, misleading biases that unduly influence how risks and benefits are perceived. </li>
            <li>The researchers believe a second language provides a useful cognitive distance from automatic processes, promoting analytical thought and reducing unthinking, emotional reaction. </li>

           <ul> 
            <li>Simple cognitive errors can have disastrous consequences�unless you know how to watch out for them. [The article has specific examples of each of the errors below.] 
             <ul> 
              <li>Redlining. Anytime we plan a mission that requires us to set a safety parameter, there's a risk that in the heat of the moment we'll be tempted to overstep it. </li>
              <li>The Domino Effect. "In stressful situations, you see a failure in the working memory, which is involved in inhibiting impulses," says Sian Beilock, a psychology professor at the University of Chicago. "People lose the ability to think about the long-term consequences of their actions." </li>
              <li>Situational Blindness. Full situational awareness requires incorporating outside information into a model of your environment, and using that model to predict how the situation might change. If all you're doing is following the line of the GPS, and it turns out to be wrong, you'll be completely clueless about what to do next. </li>
              <li>Double or Nothing. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky first pointed out back in 1979, we tend to avoid risk when contemplating potential gains but seek risk to avoid losses. For instance, if you offer people a choice between a certain loss of $1,000 and a 50-50 chance of losing $2,500, the majority will opt for the riskier option, to avoid a definite financial hit. </li>
              <li>Bending the Map. Such errors of overconfidence are due to a phenomenon psychologists call <em>confirmation bias</em>. "When trying to solve a problem or troubleshoot a problem, we get fixated on a specific option or hypothesis," explains Kring, "and ignore contradictory evidence and other information that could help us make a better decision." </li>

            <li>Fortunately, some have come to see the shortcomings of the classical MDMP process. It is illsuited for the analysis of problems exhibiting high volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. </li>
            <li>When combining hindsight bias and retrievability biases, we potentially fail to guard against an event popularized euphemistically as a <em>black swan</em>. </li>
            <li>Instead of the usual striving toward a �best practices� methodology, which is also full of potential heuristic biases, reflective practice calls for �valuing the processes that challenge assimilative knowledge (i.e. continuous truth seeking) and by embracing the inevitable conflict associated with truth seeking.� </li>

            <li>The Analytic Pathologies framework yields four insights that are crucial both to accurate diagnosis and to developing effective remedies. First, the framework enables analysts to identify individual analytic impediments and determine their sources. Second, it prompts analysts to detect the systemic pathologies that result from closely-coupled networks and to find the linkages among the individual impediments. Third, it demonstrates that each of these networks, and thus each systemic pathology, usually spans multiple levels within the hierarchy of the Intelligence Community. Fourth, the framework highlights the need to treat both the systemic pathologies and the individual impediments by focusing effective remedial measures on the right target and at the appropriate level. </li>

             <ul>
               These investigators found that 
              <em>there is a general bias, based on both innate predispositions and experience, in animals and humans, to give greater weight to negative events or attributes</em>. This is evident in four ways: 
              <ul>
                (a) negative potency (negative entities are stronger than the equivalent positive entities), 
               <br>(b) steeper negative gradients (the negativity of negative events grows more rapidly with approach to them in space or time than does the positivity of positive events), 
               <br>(c) negativity dominance (combinations of negative and positive entities yield evaluations that are more negative than the algebraic sum of individual subjective evaluations would predict), and 
               <br>(d) negative differentiation (negative entities are more varied, yield more complex conceptual representations, and engage a wider response repertoire). 
              </ul> The authors review this taxonomy, with emphasis on negativity dominance, including literary, historical, religious, and cultural sources, as well as the psychological literatures on learning, attention, impression formation, contagion, moral judgment, development, and memory. They suggest that one feature of negative events that make them dominant is that negative entities are more �contagious� than positive entities.

           This was the pivotal insight of the Scientific Revolution: that the advancement of knowledge depends on current theories collapsing in the face of new insights and discoveries. In this model of progress, errors do not lead us away from the truth. Instead, they edge us incrementally toward it.

Instead of turning away in denial when you make a mistake, you should become a connoisseur of your own mistakes, turning them over in your mind as if they were works of art, which in a way they are. � The trick is to take advantage of the particular details of the mess you�ve made, so that your next attempt will be informed by it and not just another blind stab in the dark.<br> � Daniel Dennett, in <em>Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking</em></p>

             You want to have a mind that�s open enough to accept radical new ideas,

            <p> Imagination is more important than knowledge. <br>For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, <br>while imagination embraces the entire world, <br>and all there ever will be to know and understand.<br> � Albert Einstein</p>

            <p> For myself, I found that I was fitted for nothing so well as for the study of truth; as having a Mind nimble and versatile enough to catch the Resemblances of Things (which is the chief point) and at the same time steady enough to fix and distinguish their Subtler Differences; as being gifted by Nature with Desire to seek, patience to Doubt, fondness to Meditate, slowness to assert, readiness to consider, carefulness to dispose and set in order; and as being a man that neither affects what is new nor admires what is old, and that hates every kind of Imposture. So I thought my Nature had a kind of familiarity and Relationship with Truth.<br> � Francis Bacon, <em>On the Interpretation of Nature</em>, 1603</p>

              <li>However, despite both instructors and students enjoying the critical thinking classes, many graduates were failing to think critically where it mattered most�on the job. </li>
              <li>The first key is to establish an effective talent management program at the earliest possible opportunity, preferably from the start. Until an organization gets talent management right, with a high degree of person-job and person-organization fit, it will have very limited success with its other functions. </li>
              <li>The second key to teaching critical thinking skills is to ensure the organizational climate values critical and innovative thinking. Building upon, and made possible by, a talent management program, an organization demonstrates its commitment to these values by expecting and rewarding critical thinking and innovation. </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>A better strategy for the Army�s PME is to adopt an educational philosophy that focuses less on knowledge and content and more on the ability to question and argue. Critical thinking means the ability to construct and defend an argument using reason, applying intellectual standards of epistemic responsibility, and recognizing and countering logical fallacies as we see them in others and ourselves. </li>
              <li>If we pay attention to our doctrine, this shift in thinking about professional education is a strategic imperative. We now accept as common knowledge that military operations defy rules, calling them instead �human endeavors, characterized by the continuous, mutual adaptation of give and take, moves, and countermoves among all participants.� We agree that war is about identifying and solving ill-defined problems where experts can and do disagree on the range of solutions. </li>
              <li>The problem is that we have a PME system that relies on an educational approach in which instructors are guides for each new class to rediscover the same hackneyed truths as their predecessors. </li>
              <li>Mission command requires that we do more than allow for minor heresies. It demands that we develop �heretics��leaders capable of challenging convention to create imaginative solutions regardless of the operational environment. An inquiry-based educational approach is the best way to develop these �heretics� because it is about questioning, and good questioners unequivocally make better thinkers. </li>

              <li>This issue of MIPB focuses on the integration of critical thinking and scientific inquiry throughout the military intelligence curricula. </li>
              <li>It is our contention that critical thinking and problem solving skills are best taught in learning environments that encourage students to consistently engage in the implementation of the scientific method. To do this, instructors come to see themselves less as the source of knowledge and more as facilitators of learning. Although most courses within USAIC include practical exercises, many continue to include hours of lecture, followed by objective tests. Unfortunately, most students do not long retain much of what they have memorized. Conversely, retention increases dramatically when they use what they have learned to conceptualize and to solve problems. Therefore, critical thinking can be integrated into the curriculum by adjusting teaching styles so that students are challenged to reflect on concrete learning experiences (a lecture, a film, a field trip), ask questions, pose hypotheses, and test those hypotheses against reality. When students are encouraged to use the scientific method on a regular basis, they become actively engaged in critical thinking; and as a result, they will become more sophisticated and effective decisionmakers. </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>The Command and General Staff College endeavors to instill critical thinking as a skill practiced by its graduates. To this end the college has introduced the concept of critical thinking as a class within the core curriculum. Students must take a �critical thinking test� both before and after the block of core instruction, and numerous graphic training aids line the classroom walls in an attempt to reinforce these ideas. However, it remains questionable whether or not the concepts of critical thought, that are taught by the school, have made their way into the course work and class structure within the college. This thesis will contend that to create critical thinkers CGSC must incorporate the tenets of critical thinking throughout its curriculum and course design. Grading rubrics for papers and tests, exam questions written to steer answers in a certain �correct� direction all to a degree contradict the tenets of critical thought, yet exist within the course of study. Ideally, CGSC can stand as a seminal experience in the development of officers. An experience akin to that found in civilian graduate level education can be attained, but it will require a cultural revolution within the faculty to transition from a model based on training to a model based on education. </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>[from the introduction] Dick Heuer's writings make three fundamental points about the cognitive challenges intelligence analysts face: 
               <ul> 
                <li>The mind is poorly "wired" to deal effectively with both inherent uncertainty (the natural fog surrounding complex, indeterminate intelligence issues) and induced uncertainty (the man-made fog fabricated by denial and deception operations). </li>
                <li>Even increased awareness of cognitive and other "unmotivated" biases, such as the tendency to see information confirming an already-held judgment more vividly than one sees "disconfirming" information, does little by itself to help analysts deal effectively with uncertainty. </li>
                <li>Tools and techniques that gear the analyst's mind to apply higher levels of critical thinking can substantially improve analysis on complex issues on which information is incomplete, ambiguous, and often deliberately distorted. Key examples of such intellectual devices include techniques for structuring information, challenging assumptions, and exploring alternative interpretations. </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>The Analytic Pathologies framework yields four insights that are crucial both to accurate diagnosis and to developing effective remedies. First, the framework enables analysts to identify individual analytic impediments and determine their sources. Second, it prompts analysts to detect the systemic pathologies that result from closely-coupled networks and to find the linkages among the individual impediments. Third, it demonstrates that each of these networks, and thus each systemic pathology, usually spans multiple levels within the hierarchy of the Intelligence Community. Fourth, the framework highlights the need to treat both the systemic pathologies and the individual impediments by focusing effective remedial measures on the right target and at the appropriate level. </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>We are, in fact, better at generating problems than at solving them. Rarely can we say unequivocally that we have solved a problem, particularly if it is a hard one. Rather we keep plugging away at it heuristically. Often enough we manage to satisfice�to achieve a �best-possible� solution so that we can take up something else. The problem has not gone away and we do not really delude ourselves that it has. But being realists (i.e., heuristic individuals to the core), we accept the results and live with them�recognizing that sometime we may find ourselves returning to the problem once more. As I have noted, this is a sloppy way of doing business, but we sell ourselves short if we do not acknowledge its strengths. It deals as well as anything yet developed with the fact, to use Jerome Bruner�s words, that our �ability to deal with knowledge is hugely exceeded by the potential knowledge contained in man�s environment.� </li>

              <li>This primer highlights structured analytic techniques�some widely used in the private sector and academia, some unique to the intelligence profession. It is not a comprehensive overview of how intelligence officers conduct analysis. Rather, the primer highlights how structured analytic techniques can help one challenge judgments, identify mental mindsets, stimulate creativity, and manage uncertainty. In short, incorporating regular use of techniques such as these can enable one to structure thinking for wrestling with difficult questions. </li>

              <li>Relying largely on the military�s design, testing and implementation, this paper proposes Critical Thinking (CT) training to augment current Recognition Primed Decisionmaking training (RPD). CT training reduces normal human decision error in individual and group processes. Individual CT can reduce or, in a specific case, close a hole in the Swiss Cheese model. In a group, CT can also move the hole out of alignment. Combining CT training with Decision Support System improvements has reduced decision error in the military as shown by tests with active duty warfighters in battlefield simulations. </li>

It is a very brief abridgment of Cohen, Salas, &amp; Riedel (2001), which provides more depth and detail, but is still only a start. The research had two main goals: First, to draw a map that links disparate regions of the critical thinking field, and second, to use the map to navigate toward a more insightful theory of critical thinking, which will support the development more effective methods for improving it in Army battlefield command teams. </li>
                <li>The essence of our theory is that critical thinking skill is exemplified by <em>asking questions about alternative possibilities in order to achieve some objective</em>. Asking and answering questions is a skill of <em>dialogue</em>. Alternative possibilities are represented by <em>mental models</em>. A process of questioning mental models is adopted because of its <em>reliability</em> for achieving the purposes of the participants within the available time. </li>

              <li>"I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backward. That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. In the everyday affairs of life it is more useful to reason forward, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically."

            <li><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.09/rugg.html">Scientific Method Man</a>, article in <em>Wired</em>, Sep 2004 - discussing "verifier approach" to problem solution, as used by Gordon Rugg 
             <ul> 
              <li>With the verifier approach, Rugg begins by asking experts to draw a mental map of their field. From there, he stitches together many maps to form an atlas of the universe of knowledge on the subject. "You look for an area of overlap that doesn't contain much detail," he says. "If it turns out there's an adjoining area which everyone thinks is someone else's territory, then that's a potential gap." </li>
              <li>His approach is built on the observation, noted as far back as the 1970s, that experts tend to cut to the chase. In their zeal to get to an answer, they make many little mistakes. (A recent study of work published in <em>Nature</em> and <em>British Medical Journal</em>, for example, found that 11 percent of papers had serious statistical errors.) Experts unknowingly fudge logic to square data with their hypotheses. Or they develop blind spots after years of working in isolation. They lose their ability to take a broader view. If all this is true, he says, think of how much big science is based on flawed intuition. </li>
              <li><img src="graphics/spiffy.gif" alt="spiffy"> The verifier method boils down to seven steps: 
               <ul> 
                <li> 1) amass knowledge of a discipline through interviews and reading; </li>
                <li> 2) determine whether critical expertise has yet to be applied in the field; </li>
                <li> 3) look for bias and mistakenly held assumptions in the research; </li>
                <li> 4) analyze jargon to uncover differing definitions of key terms; </li>
                <li> 5) check for classic mistakes using human-error tools; </li>
                <li> 6) follow the errors as they ripple through underlying assumptions; </li>
                <li> 7) suggest new avenues for research that emerge from steps one through six. </li>
               </ul> </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>Senior officers capable of critical and creative thinking are needed more than ever to plan and conduct operations in strategic and operational environments that offer ever-changing uncertainties in increasingly complex conditions. Officers who have a broad body of knowledge gained through experience and extensive study and capable of identifying and evaluating potential military response options within the context of a grand strategy are necessary to achieve the goals of the nation. The development of such officers requires a shift in their extensive focus from the operational and tactical environments to the strategic environment. This is a tremendous undertaking given that by far one spends the majority of one�s career at those lower levels of war and promotion to senior ranks relies upon excellence in tactical thinking and execution. The aim of the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, is to educate strategically minded officers with the ability to view military affairs in the broadest context. </li>
              <li>This essay posits that integrating design as a process within JOPP is a shortsighted attempt to legislate thinking whereas the more appropriate option would be to develop officers capable of design thinking. To develop senior officers who possess the requisite worldview, critical and creative thinking must underpin the concept of design. Senior officers must understand the role constraints play within design and how the strategic environment is affected. Two accepted approaches in design thinking, analysis/synthesis and conjecture/analysis, could provide senior officers with the unique perspectives necessary for planning at all levels of war. In addition, the unique skills that specific personality types possess that make strategic-thinking and design thinking more inherently natural must be recognized and promoted. </li>
              <li>Strategically minded thinkers possess the ability to think critically and creatively. To think critically, one needs the ability to break concepts or objects into simpler parts and understand the relationship and organization of the parts relative to the whole. To think creatively, one needs the ability to rearrange the components or ideas into a new whole; in other words, to produce something through imaginative skill. Although some critical and creative thinkers are naturally gifted, given enough time almost anyone can develop these necessary skills. Unfortunately, for the majority of senior military leaders, time is something that is not in vast supply. In fact, given the relatively short duration of time that senior officers spend operating in the strategic environment and the even shorter periods they serve in any one position, it is a natural desire to attempt to develop a checklist or shortcut that will guide these officers through the wicked problems rife within complex environments. </li>

              <li>Great design does not come from great process; it comes from great designers. </li>
              <li>The critical thing about the design process is to identify your scarcest resource. </li>
              <li>You have to make sure your whole team understands what scarce resource you're optimizing. </li>

              <li>Edwin Land, inventor of the Polaroid camera, once said that his method of design was to start with a vision of what you want and then, one by one, remove the technical obstacles until you have it. </li>

             The one common experience of all humanity is the challenge of problems.
            <br> � R. Buckminster Fuller 
            <p> I am enthusiastic over humanity's extraordinary and sometimes very timely ingenuities. If you are in a shipwreck and all the boats are gone, a piano top buoyant enough to keep you afloat may come along and make a fortuitous life preserver. This is not to say, though, that the best way to design a life preserver is in the form of a piano top. I think we are clinging to a great many piano tops in accepting yesterday's fortuitous contrivings as constituting the only means for solving a given problem.<br> � R. Buckminster Fuller</p>
            <p> If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.<br> � Albert Einstein</p>
            <p> Intellectuals solve problems; geniuses prevent them.<br> � Albert Einstein</p>
            <p> We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.<br> � Albert Einstein</p>
            <p> The biggest problem in the world could have been solved when it was small.<br> � Witter Bynner</p>
            <p> There is always an easy solution to every human problem�neat, plausible, and wrong.<br> � H.L. Mencken</p>
            <p> If a problem has no solution, it may not be a problem, but a fact - not to be solved, but to be coped with over time.<br> � Shimon Peres</p>

             <ul> 
              <li>Preparing Soldiers to learn from problem-solving experiences requires that Army instructional practices become more responsive to individual student need, better attuned to operational requirements, and more representative of social learning contexts. To help instructors achieve this goal, the principles for facilitating problem-based learning must be investigated and their implications for professional development explicated. In this research, the instructor characteristics and competencies required to implement problem-based learning were explored. Techniques for instructor professional development in civilian and military contexts then were examined to identify best practices. </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>Since Apollo 17's flight in 1972, no humans have been back to the moon, or gone anywhere beyond low Earth orbit. No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10. (Since the last flight of the supersonic Concorde in 2003, civilian travel has become slower.) Blithe optimism about technology's powers has evaporated, too, as big problems that people had imagined technology would solve, such as hunger, poverty, malaria, climate change, cancer, and the diseases of old age, have come to seem intractably hard. </li>
              <li>It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology; we can. We must. But all these elements must be present: political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem, our institutions must support its solution, it must really be a technological problem, and we must understand it. </li>

              <li>There are two broad approaches to addressing ill-structured problems. First, a problem-focused approach which prioritizes a robust knowledge of the environment from which the problem has emerged. Second, a solution-focused approach that emphasizes the power of proposing solutions as the vehicle to gain understanding of the ill-structured problem. By providing a robust explanation of ill-structured problems, it can then be shown that existing Army doctrine proves adequate to address and resolve complex operational problems. </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>Traditional hierarchical military staff organizations at the operational level of command remain suited for executing status quo and slowly evolving military operations focused on simple problems. However, these same hierarchies are rendered ineffective when faced with complex or wicked problems�an increasingly common occurrence. Replacing traditional staff structures with flat, self-organizing networks at the operational level of command and war will allow commanders to efficiently synchronize vast resources and more effectively attack rapidly evolving, complex and wicked problems. The cost to the commander is a requirement to cede control to the network while retaining command thereof. This paper looks at the limitations of hierarchical organizations, the advantages of leveraging self-organizing networks in a contemporary military context, and how such networks should be created and commanded. Finally, the paper provides recommendations to operational commanders concerning when and how to employ self-organizing networks within operational level staffs. </li>

            <li>How to Think<strong>:</strong> Wicked Problems, Reflections from Dr Jack, Combined Arms Center Blog, 11 Nov 2008 
             <ul> 
              <li>"The term �wicked problems� was coined by Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber in 1973 to describe problems in planning that defy analytical methods for solutions" </li>
              <li>includes Rittle and Webber's 10 criteria for defining a "wicked problem" - with a brief description of each </li>
              <li>"There are a number of key implications from the concept of �wicked problems.� One issue is that there must be constant framing and reframing of a wicked problem to identify the second and third order effects of a plan or operation. A great plan may be only treating a symptom and not the underlying causes of the problem � potentially making the situation worse. Constant reframing and assessment are necessary to identify this throughout planning and operations." </li>
              <li>"Another issue with �wicked problems� is that there are frequently multiple problems and issues within a problem set. The tendency to identify a problem as a familiar and simple problem � looking for simple cause and effect relationship � may mask multiple problems and lead to wrong solutions." </li>
             </ul> <p> </p></li>
            <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">Wicked problem</a>, entry in Wikipedia - includes descriptions of several strategies to cope witih wicked problems, and includes the following list of characteristics (from Ritchey, referring to Rittel and Webber) 
             <ol> 
              <li>There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem (defining wicked problems is itself a wicked problem). </li>
              <li>Wicked problems have no stopping rule. </li>
              <li>Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but better or worse. </li>
              <li>There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem. </li>
              <li>Every solution to a wicked problem is a "one-shot operation"; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial and error, every attempt counts significantly. </li>
              <li>Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan. </li>
              <li>Every wicked problem is essentially unique. </li>
              <li>Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem. </li>
              <li>The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem's resolution. </li>
              <li>The planner has no right to be wrong (planners are liable for the consequences of the actions they generate). </li>

             <ul> 
              <li><strong>Wicked problems are complex problems that change when you apply a solution.</strong> </li>
              <li> </li>
              <li>What�s the best way to solve a wicked problem � by working in a large group sharing ideas via the intranet or as individuals? That�s the question George S. Davidson and his research team at Sandia National Laboratories attempted to resolve this summer. </li>
              <li>... </li>
              <li>�We were amazed at the length and quality of the responses, both from the people working as a group and those working individually,� Dornburg says. �People were very engaged, often writing long, detailed responses.� </li>
              <li>She adds that what was most interesting is that the quality of ideas from the people responding as individuals was �significantly better across all three quality ratings.� </li>
              <li>Dornburg says the finding that individuals are more successful than groups in computer-mediated brainstorming suggests a time- and cost-saving potential for companies. Generally, when electronic group brainstorming is compared to face-to-face brainstorming, it is touted as having the advantages of shorter meetings, increased participation by remote team members, better documentation via electronic recording, and cash savings. But the Sandia research suggests that people working to solve problems on their own might involve less time and, thus less expenses, than electronic group brainstorming. </li>
              <li>While individuals working alone nominally faired better in this study, Davidson says, the research also indicates that group on-line brainstorming can be effective when ideas are needed from large numbers of people. </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>What is a wicked problem? Conklin draws his definition from the work of the late urban planner Horst Rittel, who coined the term over thirty years ago: 
               <ol type="1"> 
                <li>You don't understand the problem until you have developed a solution. </li>
                <li>Wicked problems have no stopping rule. You simply run out of time or money. </li>
                <li>Solutions to wicked problems are not right or wrong. They are "better," "worse," "good enough," or "not good enough." </li>
                <li>Every wicked problem is essentially unique and novel. </li>
                <li>Every solution to a wicked problem is a "one-shot operation." </li>
                <li>Wicked problems have no given alternative solutions. </li>
               </ol> </li>
              <li>So where does that leave the project manager? The short answer � what Conklin calls "the Holy Grail of effective collaboration" � lies in "creating shared understanding about the problem, and shared commitment to the possible solutions." </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>Globalization and the information age have created an environment in which small unit leaders have operational and strategic importance. The demands of the Irregular Warfare require small unit leaders within the General Purpose Forces to be more culturally aware; intellectually adaptable; seasoned in their decision-making requiring fundamental changes in the way they are educated, trained, and gain experience. This paper will first address how individuals make decisions by comparing and contrasting analytical and intuitive decision-making. Second, it will address the strengths and weaknesses in current training and educational paradigms via an analysis of the Systems Approach to Training. Third will be a proposal for the inclusion of new initiatives for developing small unit leader intuition and adaptability in IW. Following this are recommendations for inculcating critical thinking and decision-making skills in small unit leaders by adopting methods of instruction found in Outcomes Based Training and Education and Adaptive Leaders Methodology as well as the experiential based learning that immersive training environments provide. </li>

              <li>Although humans restrict information in a variety of ways, the focus here is on three specific forms that affect human information processing: (a) the tendency to see patterns where none exist, (b) the tendency to seek confirmatory evidence, and (c) the use of preconceived biases. </li>
              <li>Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman presented three heuristics, i.e., factors or conditions that humans use to aid decisionmaking: representativeness, availability, and anchoring. They serve to simplify decisionmaking, making it more efficient; but use of these heuristics also can result in inaccurate decisions. </li>

              <li>Relying largely on the military�s design, testing and implementation, this paper proposes Critical Thinking (CT) training to augment current Recognition Primed Decisionmaking training (RPD). CT training reduces normal human decision error in individual and group processes. Individual CT can reduce or, in a specific case, close a hole in the Swiss Cheese model. In a group, CT can also move the hole out of alignment. Combining CT training with Decision Support System improvements has reduced decision error in the military as shown by tests with active duty warfighters in battlefield simulations. </li>

              <li>The three military decision-making models reflect a parallel progression in the evolution of systems thinking. Initially, rational military decisionmaking supported solving well-structured problems such as those found in a mechanistic system. Decision-making primed by recognition subsequently evolved to address problems occurring in natural settings with which the decision-maker had experience. An intuitive decision-making process then emerged to cope with those situations for which decision-makers had no previous experience. </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>The Army values MDMP as the sanctioned approach for solving problems and making decisions. This stolid template is comforting; we are familiar with it. However, what do we do when our enemy does not conform to our assumptions embedded in the process? We discovered early in Iraq that our opponents fought differently than we expected. </li>
              <li>Fortunately, some have come to see the shortcomings of the classical MDMP process. It is illsuited for the analysis of problems exhibiting high volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. The Army�s nascent answer, called �Design,� looks promising. As outlined in the new version of FM 5-0, Operations Process, Chapter 3, Design is defined as �a methodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand, visualize, and describe complex, ill-structured problems and develop approaches to solve them.� Instead of a universal process to solve all types of problems (MDMP), the Design approach acknowledges that military commanders must first appreciate the situation and recognize that any solution will be unique. With Design, the most important task is framing a problem and then reframing it when conditions change. </li>
              <li>In this article, we will survey three important heuristics to military decision making: availability, representativeness, and anchoring. </li>
              <li>When combining hindsight bias and retrievability biases, we potentially fail to guard against an event popularized euphemistically as a <em>black swan</em>. </li>
              <li>Instead of the usual striving toward a �best practices� methodology, which is also full of potential heuristic biases, reflective practice calls for �valuing the processes that challenge assimilative knowledge (i.e. continuous truth seeking) and by embracing the inevitable conflict associated with truth seeking.� </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>A sophisticated reader ought to view with great skepticism the prospect of answering questions about the long-term future. The checkered history of predicting the future � from the famous declarations that humans would never fly to the Limits to Growth study to claims about the �New Economy� � has dissuaded policymakers from considering the effects of their decisions more than a few months or years ahead. However, today�s choices will significantly influence the course of the twenty-first century. New analytic methods, enabled by modern computers, may transform our ability to reason systematically about the long term. This report reviews traditional methods of grappling with the morrow, from narratives to scenario analysis, which fail to address the multiplicity of plausible long-term futures. The authors demonstrate a quantitative approach to long-term policy analysis (LTPA). Robust decision methods enable decisionmakers to examine a vast range of plausible futures and design near-term, often adaptive, strategies to be robust across them. Reframing the question �What will the long-term future bring?� as �How can we choose actions today that will be consistent with our long-term interests?� these methods provide powerful analytic support to humans� innate capacity for �what-if-ing.� </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>Effectiveness measures provide decision makers feedback on the impact of deliberate actions and affect critical issues such as allocation of scarce resources, as well as whether to maintain or change existing strategy. Currently, however, there is no formal foundation for formulating effectiveness measures. This research presents a new framework for effectiveness measurement from both a theoretical and practical view. ... Finally, the pragmatic nature of the approach is illustrated by measuring the effectiveness of a notional, security force response strategy in a scenario involving a terrorist attack on a United States Air Force base. </li>

              <li>In short, the military systems (including weapons) now on the horizon will be too fast, too small, too numerous, and will create an environment too complex for humans to direct. Furthermore, the proliferation of information-based systems will produce a data overload that will make it difficult or impossible for humans to directly intervene in decisionmaking. This is not a consideration for the remote science-fiction future. Weapons and other military systems already under development will function at increasingly higher levels of complexity and responsibility--and increasingly without meaningful human intervention. </li>

               <ul> 
                <li>A lack of Combatant Commander (COCOM) critical thinking in the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP) is a causal factor in military failure at the operational level. However, critical thinking can improve the MDMP of the COCOM. This paper analyzes the effects of critical thinking on the combatant commander�s decision making process by: defining critical thinking; illustrating its impact on intuitive and analytical decisions; demonstrating barriers to critical thinking and proposing practical ways to use critical thinking in the MDMP. </li>

              <li>Considering the request for assistance and the proposed application of the MDM, the DoD IG Team created a �universal� model that can be used to assess the capability and capacity of any organization founded on democratic principles and the �Rule of Law.� For the purposes of this model, the definition of �organization� includes the full spectrum of organizational structures�from a nation-state to any type of government-, military-, or business-related entity. Consequently, the DoD IG Team built the attached model and identified the high-level elements common to most organizations that should be considered to establish a viable, stable, and selfsustaining institution. This document, therefore, includes the Management Decision Model, instructions on how to use the model, and a comprehensive description of the various elements embedded in the model�s architecture. </li>

              <li>Numerous studies show no matter how many factors are important, the human mind normally can handle only about seven factors (e.g., seven-digit telephone numbers). </li>
              <li>People are not always aware of which factors dominate their decision process. Although we say �safety first,� this doesn�t mean it�s necessarily first in actual decisions. Also, people are seldom aware of the few factors they actually are processing so tend to be overconfident in their decisionmaking ability. </li>
              <li>Studies also show that our linear thinking tends to underestimate hazards, particularly if the hazard is increasing at a logarithmic or exponential rate as can happen on the fireline. An example would be estimating rates of fire spread. A computer would give the better decision in a heartbeat. People would tend to underestimate the rate of spread and have difficulty deciding on an appropriate course of action. And so it is important to understand the limits of how we process information and common types of errors that can occur. </li>

              <li>Note 18. Intuitive decisionmaking more appropriate for the vast majority of tactical/operational decisions: A 1989 study by Gary A. Klein (based on 1985 observations) estimated that decision makers in a variety of disciplines use intuitive methods 87 percent of the time and analytical methods 13 percent of the time. Evidence now suggests that this study was actually biased <em>in favor of analysis</em>. More recent studies estimate the breakdown at more nearly 95 percent intuitive to 5 percent analytical. G. A.

             <ul> 
              <li>Nearly all missions this century will be complex, and the kind of thinking we have called �operational art� is often now required at battalion level. Fundamentally, operational art requires balancing design and planning while remaining open to learning and adapting quickly to change. Design is not a new idea. Command has always entailed responsibility for designing operations while penetrating complexity and framing problems that planners have to solve. Individual ability to learn effectively, adapt rapidly and appropriately, and to solve problems has always been self-evidently valuable to commanders. Yet, collectively, a command�s overall quality of design, learning, and adaptation is what determines results. Military leaders may value individual creativity, critical thinking, continuous learning, and adaptability in their staffs and subordinate commanders, but individual traits do not necessarily add up to collective abilities needed for the best outcomes. <p> </p></li>
              <li><strong>Complicated versus complex systems.</strong> Merely complicated systems are composed of numerous parts and structures, all logically separable from their environment. An example would be the system for deploying units on a time table for an operation like D-day. Such a schedule could be accurately analyzed in the abstract. Complex systems are made up of dynamic, interactive, and adaptive elements that cannot be separated from interaction with their environments. The significant elements of complex systems are human beings and their relationships. An example would be the action-reaction interplay of the various actors in cooperation and contention on D-day. Analysis could never predict the relationships that were the most important part of the flow of events.<p> Where merely complicated systems require mostly deduction and analysis (formal logic of breaking into parts), complexity requires inductive and abductive reasoning for diagnostics and synthesis (the informal logic of making new wholes of parts). Because the elements of complex systems we care most about are human ones, making sense of relationships requires hypothetical synthesis in the form of maps or narratives. Such maps and narratives evolve as informal products that reflect a dimly perceived truth at a moment of understanding in time. To make the best sense of human relationships, interactions, trends, and propensities, military commands have to adopt a habitually skeptical approach to such non-deductive conclusions. Such habituation implies a new intellectual culture that balances design and planning while evincing an appreciation for the dynamic flow of human factors and a bias toward perpetual learning and adapting. </p></li>

            <li><a href="sam/complex-complicated.pdf">Adding to the Toolkit: Three Conceptual Tradeoffs (<font color="red">local copy</font>)</a>, by Austin, SAMS paper, AY10 
             <ul> 
              <li>This monograph shows how understanding three conceptual tradeoffs of complex versus complicated, complexity at large-scale versus fine-scale, and exploration of potential problems versus exploitation of known solutions can help the military practitioner better learn, anticipate and adapt to difficult problems. It does so by defining the three conceptual tradeoffs and then applying them to Operation Iraqi Freedom for the United States in 2003 and the Israeli incursion into Southern Lebanon by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2006. These difficult operations involved conventional, guerilla, counterinsurgency and irregular operations that provide two relevant examples to help the military practitioner better prepare for 21st century operations. <p> </p></li>
              <li>Being a complicated or complex problem does not imply that one is easier or harder to manage than the other. They are just different. Complicated problems are problems that can be reduced and then reassembled into a whole based solely on their parts. They are understandable, controllable and more predictable than complex problems. Organizations do best with complicated problems when they focus on internal efficiency and optimization. Complex problems are not as predictable due to interdependencies and feedback. Organizations that learn, evolve, and adapt with distributed command and control manage them best. Although the ends may be the same, the ways and means to solve complex versus complicated problems are different. <p> </p></li>
              <li>To help understand how organizations orient towards complex problems, the scientist William Ross Ashby created a useful concept called the Law of Requisite Variety. It states that a problem can only be controlled if the variety of the controller matches the variety of the situation to be controlled. Put another way, the complexity of a task must be matched by the complexity of a system trying to perform the task effectively. <p> </p></li>
              <li>Much as hierarchically controlled organizations are able to focus on efficiency and optimization, the more distributed the command and control of an organization, the less efficient it becomes, despite its potential ability to manage more complexity. Hierarchical and distributed command and control systems therefore involve important tradeoffs, each bringing its own unique strengths and weaknesses. </li>

             <ul> 
              <li>While all decisions are a guess about the future, as complexity builds upon complexity decision-makers must increasingly rely on their intuition and judgment. This chapter explores the decision-making process for complex situations in a complex environment (complex adaptive messes) in terms of: laying the groundwork for decision-making, understanding and exploring complex situations, discussing human additive factors, preparing for the decision process and mechanisms for influencing complex situations. Laying the groundwork introduces the concepts of emergence, the butterfly effect, the tipping point, feedback loops and power laws. Mechanisms for influencing complex situations include structural adaptation, boundary management, absorption, optimum complexity, simplification, sense and respond, amplification, and seeding. The authors forward that decision-makers may be able to construct a strategy that guides problem resolution through a sequence of decisions and actions leading toward an acceptable solution. </li>

              <li>The Department of Defense is a large and complex social system with many interrelated parts. As with any system of this type, when changes are made to one part, many others are affected in a cascading and often unpredictable manner.

              <li>Peter Senge submits, in <em>The Fifth Discipline</em>, that systems thinking provides just the type of discipline and toolset needed to encourage the seeing of �interrelationships rather than things, for seeing patterns of change rather than static �snapshots.�� Senge argues that this shift of mind is necessary to deal with the complexities of dynamic social systems. </li>

              <li>Abstract - This effort's objective was to identify and hybridize a suite of technologies enabling the development of predictive decision aids for use principally in combat environments but also in any complex information terrain. The technologies required included formal concept analysis for knowledge representation and information operations, Peircean reasoning to support hypothesis generation, Mill�s canons to begin defining information operators that support the first two technologies and co-evolutionary game theory to provide the environment / domain to assess predictions from the reasoning engines. The intended application domain is the IED problem because of its inherent evolutionary nature. While a fully functioning integrated algorithm was not achieved the hybridization and demonstration of the technologies was accomplished and demonstration of utility provided for a number of ancillary queries. </li>
              <li>Figure 1 [on PDF page 5] shows a decision making paradigm </li>
              <li>The reasoning engine is based on C.S. Peirce�s model of scientific inquiry. This philosophical construct provides the foundation for how we as humans reason about situations new to us. This model consists of three reasoning capabilities; Abduction, deduction and induction. A crude way of looking at this suite of logic is abduction provides plausible hypotheses to explain an observation, deduction provides a basis for selecting from that set of hypotheses, and induction is the means to validate the hypothesis selected. </li>

For example, using induction, a child learns to associate the color red with heat and heat with pain, and then to generalize these associations to new situations. Rigorous induction depends upon demonstrating the validity of causal relationships between observed phenomena, not merely associating them with each other. </li>
                <li>2. Deduction: Deductive reasoning applies general rules to specific problems to arrive at conclusions. Analysts begin with a set of rules and use them as a basis for interpreting information. For example, an analyst who follows the nuclear weapons program of a country might notice that a characteristic series of events preceded the last nuclear weapons test. Upon seeing evidence that those same events are occurring again, the analyst might deduce that a second nuclear test is imminent. However, this conclusion would be made cautiously, since deduction works best in closed systems such as mathematics, making it of limited use in forecasting human behavior. </li>
                <li>3. Abduction: Abductive reasoning describes the thought process that accompanies �insight� or intuition. When the information does not match that expected, the analyst asks �why?,� thereby generating novel hypotheses to explain given evidence that does not readily suggest a familiar explanation. For example, given two shipping manifests, one showing oranges and lemons being shipped from Venezuela to Florida, and the other showing carnations being shipped from Delaware to Colombia, abductive reasoning is what enables the analyst to take an analytic leap and ask, �Why is citrus fruit being sent to the worldwide capital of citrus farming, while carnations are being sent to the world�s primary exporter of that product? What is really going on here?� Thus, abduction relies on the analyst�s preparation and experience to suggest possible explanations that must then be tested. Abduction generates new research questions rather than solutions </li>

An imaging study of deductive and inductive reasoning</a>, by Goel et al, Dept of Psychology, York U., North York, Ontario, CA -- abstract posted by National Library of Medicine <p> </p>
             <ul>
               We carried out a neuroimaging study to test the neurophysiological predictions made by different cognitive models of reasoning. Ten normal volunteers performed deductive and inductive reasoning tasks while their regional cerebral blood flow pattern was recorded using [15O]H2O PET imaging. In the control condition subjects semantically comprehended sets of three sentences. In the deductive reasoning condition subjects determined whether the third sentence was entailed by the first two sentences. In the inductive reasoning condition subjects reported whether the third sentence was plausible given the first two sentences. The deduction condition resulted in activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 45, 47). The induction condition resulted in activation of a large area comprised of the left medial frontal gyrus, the left cingulate gyrus, and the left superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 8, 9, 24, 32). Induction was distinguished from deduction by the involvement of the medial aspect of the left superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 8, 9). These results are consistent with cognitive models of reasoning that postulate different mechanisms for inductive and deductive reasoning and view deduction as a formal rule-based process.

             <ul> 
              <li>Counterfactual reasoning is the process of evaluating conditional claims about alternate possibilities and their consequences (i.e., �What If� statements). These alternatives can be either past possibilities (e.g., �If the United States had not abolished the Iraqi army in 2003, then the Iraqi insurgency would have been significantly smaller in 2005�) or future possibilities (e.g., �If Iran had nuclear weapons, then it would provide this technology to Hezbollah�). Counterfactuals are essential to intelligence analysis because they are implicit in all strategic assessments. </li>
              <li>Counterfactual claims are widespread among our national security analysts, strategists, and decision makers. Unfortunately, this is not widely recognized. Furthermore, there is no comprehensive model of counterfactual reasoning to which anyone may turn if they do become aware of the ubiquitous nature of counterfactuals within intelligence and national security. Instead, there are several fragmented approaches in philosophy, logic, history, political science, and psychology. To make matters worse, none of these approaches has been applied to the unique challenges of intelligence and security. In response, this work seeks to demonstrate both the structure and the significance of counterfactual reasoning. It offers not only the first complete system of counterfactual reasoning (of which this author is aware), but the first one specifically designed to address the domain of intelligence analysis and national security. Furthermore, this work proposes three major claims about the place of counterfactual reasoning in analysis and strategy. Therefore, this work is not only intended to serve as an <em>education</em> in counterfactual reasoning, but also as an <em>exhortation</em> to counterfactual reasoning. </li>
              <li><strong>First Major Proposal</strong> (The Strategic Presumption of Counterfactuals): All strategies (and analyses of them) are grounded in a series of counterfactual claims about alternate possibilities, their consequences, and the relationships between them. </li>
              <li><strong>Second Major Proposal</strong> (The Systematic Potential of Counterfactuals): Major extant methods for assessing alternate possibilities, their consequences, and the relationships between them may be viewed as ultimately not distinct, but as aspects of a single process�counterfactual reasoning. </li>
              <li><strong>Third Major Proposal</strong> (The Structural Priority of Counterfactuals): All assessment of alternate possibilities, their consequences, and the relationships between them should ultimately be conditional (as it is in counterfactual reasoning). </li>

                <li>System 1, or fast thinking, operates automatically and quickly with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. </li>
                <li>System 2, or slow thinking, allocates attention to the mental activities that demand effort, such as complex computations and conscious, reasoned choices about what to think and what to do. </li>
                <li>Kahneman focuses much of the book on the interactions of System 1 and System 2 and the problems inherent in those interactions. Both systems are �on� when we are awake. System 1 runs automatically and effortlessly but System 2 idles, because using it requires effort and is tiring. System 1 generates impressions and feelings, which become the source of System 2�s explicit beliefs and deliberate choices. System 1, when it encounters something it cannot quickly understand and did not expect (in other words, a surprise), enlists System 2 to make sense of the anomaly. The alerted System 2 takes charge, overriding System 1�s automatic reactions. System 2 always has the last word when it chooses to assert it. </li>

              <li>Human reactions appear to be controlled by two separate types of mental processes: one fast, automatic, and unconscious and the other slow, deliberate, and conscious. With the attention in the literature focused on the taxonomy of the two processes, there is little discussion of how they interact. In this paper, we focus on modeling the slower process's ability to inhibit the fast process. We present computational cognitive models in which different strategies allow a human to consciously inhibit an undesirable fast response. </li>

              <li>Carl Von Clausewitz explains that events in warfare are surrounded by uncertainty, and that there are few universal truths. Because of this, leaders must sort through this �fog� to find the truth, often a daunting endeavor that�s permeated by chance. The commander must sift through this information and decide what pieces are relevant and require action. Clausewitz specifically refers to the capability of the mind to discriminate information allowing quick, correct decisions. He describes this ability as <font color="red">coup d�oeil, �the quick recognition of a truth that the mind would ordinarily miss or would perceive only after long study and reflection</font>.�<sup>2</sup> Napoleon faced such a scenario in the battles of Jena-Auerstadt. With limited information, he turned an entire field army in place to seek decisive battle with the Prussians and won the day.

              <li>The man has a machine strapped to his head, an array of electrodes called an electroencephalogram, or EEG, which is recording his brain activity as each image skips by. It then sends the brain-activity data wirelessly to a large computer. The computer has learned what the man's brain activity looks like when he sees one of the visual targets, and, based on that information, it quickly reshuffles the images. When the man sorts back through the hundreds of images�most without structures, but some with�almost all the ones with buildings in them pop to the front of the pack. His brain and the computer have done good work. </li>
              <li>That display was a demonstration of a new technology being developed through a collaboration between the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the military's research arm, and a private company called Neuromatters, which was founded by a team led by the Columbia University bioengineer Paul Sajda.

   <li>In this talk, Richard J. Davidson will explore recent scientific research on the neuroscience of positive human qualities and how they can be cultivated through contemplative practice. Distinctions among different forms of contemplative practices will be introduced and they will be shown to have different neural and behavioral consequences, as well as important consequences for physical health in both long-term and novice practitioners. New research also shows that meditation-based interventions delivered online can produce behavioral and neural changes. Collectively, this body of research indicates that we can cultivate adaptive neural changes and strengthen positive human qualities through systematic mental practice.

             <ul> 
              <li>Imagine living a life in which you are completely aware of the world around you but you're prevented from engaging in it because you are completely paralyzed. Even speaking is impossible. For an estimated 50,000 Americans this is a harsh reality. It's called locked-in syndrome, a condition in which people with normal cognitive brain activity suffer severe paralysis, often from injuries or an illness such as Lou Gehrig's disease. Boston University neuroscientist Frank Guenther works with the National Science Foundation's Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science and Technology (CELEST), which is made up of eight private and public institutions, mostly in the Boston area. Its purpose is to synthesize the experimental modeling and technological approaches to research in order to understand how the brain learns as a whole system. In particular, Guenther's research is looking at how brain regions interact, with the hope of melding mind and machine, and ultimately making life much better for people with locked-in syndrome. </li>
