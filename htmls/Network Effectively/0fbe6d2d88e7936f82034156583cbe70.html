        Yet, according to a survey conducted by global career experts at Right Management,&nbsp;
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2011/06/07/networking-is-still-the-best-way-to-find-a-job-survey-says/" title="Link: http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2011/06/07/networking-is-still-the-best-way-to-find-a-job-survey-says/">networking is the best way to land a job</a>.&nbsp;It's so much more powerful than blindly sending job applications into the Internet abyss. Although n
        <span>etworking can be great, it can <i>also</i> be uncomfortable and difficult to master. It's easy to be polite</span>&nbsp;and just go through the motions, but making that lasting powerful connection that will actually lead you somewhere you want to be is what makes it all worthwhile.&nbsp;

        After attending several career boot camp workshops and doing a little more online research, I realized a few of the things I've been doing wrong while networking and corrected them. Sure enough, after taking it all in, my next few networking experiences gradually became easier, less painful, and I eventually got a job out of all of the work. So, with the help of Frank Underwood's social graces, here are seven of the most common networking mistakes to avoid.
       </div> 
       <h2>1. Being Insincere&nbsp;</h2> 
       <div>
        <attachment data-provider-id="%3Ciframe%20src=%22//giphy.com/embed/d6K4zOlca8YRq%22%20width=%22480%22%20height=%22481%22%20frameBorder=%220%22%20class=%22giphy-embed%22%20allowFullScreen%3E%3C/iframe%3E%3Cp%3E%3Ca%20href=%22http://giphy.com/gifs/house-of-cards-kevin-spacey-d6K4zOlca8YRq%22%3Evia%20GIPHY%3C/a%3E%3C/p%3E" data-provider="generic" data-type="embed" data-content="<div class=&quot;article-body-embed&quot;><iframe src=&quot;//giphy.com/embed/d6K4zOlca8YRq&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;481&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen></iframe></div>" data-attribution="" contenteditable="false">

       </div> 
       <p>One of the reasons professional networking gets such a bad rap is because so many people make the mistake of being fake. Asking for things is difficult and puts you in a vulnerable position, especially when you're trying to pitch yourself to someone. When networking starts to become a chore, no one ends up happy. Do it honestly. Know why you're doing it and identify what you want out of it. At the same time, it's not all about you. If you flip your mindset to think of what the other person wants and how you can help them achieve it, that's when the magic happens.&nbsp;</p> 
       <div>
        Along with this, it's good to be more selective in who you choose to network with. According to Dean Mercado a marketing strategist, in an 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.onlinemarketingmuscle.com/how-to-choose-where-to-network/" title="Link: http://www.onlinemarketingmuscle.com/how-to-choose-where-to-network/">article for Online Marketing Muscle</a>, choosing your target market — aka finding people in industries you're interested in and what events they attend — is one of the most important parts of networking. Don't exchange business cards with absolutely every human you come in contact with. While having a big network is helpful, a network with dead-end connections made by spreading yourself too thin won't be as effective.

       <h2>2. Avoiding Conversation</h2> 
       <div>
        <attachment data-provider-id="%3Ciframe%20src=%22//giphy.com/embed/Jzk8q62krr04M%22%20width=%22480%22%20height=%22240%22%20frameBorder=%220%22%20class=%22giphy-embed%22%20allowFullScreen%3E%3C/iframe%3E%3Cp%3E%3Ca%20href=%22http://giphy.com/gifs/house-of-cards-frank-underwood-claire-Jzk8q62krr04M%22%3Evia%20GIPHY%3C/a%3E%3C/p%3E" data-provider="generic" data-type="embed" data-content="<div class=&quot;article-body-embed&quot;><iframe src=&quot;//giphy.com/embed/Jzk8q62krr04M&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen></iframe></div>" data-attribution="" contenteditable="false">

       <p>Approaching that super cute guy or girl at the bar pretty much equates to the awkward nightmare that is striking up conversation with a potential professional contact. In both cases, being the wallflower has no perks. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/88720-how-to-make-small-talk-with-strangers-no-matter-how-much-awkward-sauce-you-usually-put">Initiating conversation with a stranger</a>&nbsp;not only provides a powerful first impression, but gets you one step closer to making a great connection by having the actual conversation you want to have.&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>It helps to master the art of closing a conversation, too. You may know when a convo has run its course, but can't find a polite enough way to end it. Chances are, the other person is feeling just as uncomfortable by the end and will absolutely love you for so impressively salvaging the situation.&nbsp;CEO &amp; Founder of FindSpark&nbsp;Emily Miethner gave some great <a target="_blank" href="https://www.findspark.com/how-to-start-end-networking-conversations/" title="Link: https://www.findspark.com/how-to-start-end-networking-conversations/">tips for conversation starters and closers</a> that'll make for smooth intros and graceful exits. Like a true networking ninja.&nbsp;</p> 
       <h2>3. Being Unprepared</h2> 
       <div>
        <attachment data-provider-id="%3Ciframe%20src=%22//giphy.com/embed/1guRIRStl9oVReXGxJS%22%20width=%22480%22%20height=%22418%22%20frameBorder=%220%22%20class=%22giphy-embed%22%20allowFullScreen%3E%3C/iframe%3E%3Cp%3E%3Ca%20href=%22http://giphy.com/gifs/house-of-cards-kevin-spacey-are-you-serious-1guRIRStl9oVReXGxJS%22%3Evia%20GIPHY%3C/a%3E%3C/p%3E" data-provider="generic" data-type="embed" data-content="<div class=&quot;article-body-embed&quot;><iframe src=&quot;//giphy.com/embed/1guRIRStl9oVReXGxJS&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;418&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen></iframe></div>" data-attribution="" contenteditable="false">

       <p>Do your research or run the risk of dealing with ultimate Frank Underwood sass. Don't make the rookie mistake of thinking you can get by with general questions and talking points. Being unprepared is what leads to the first mistake of insincerity listed here. <b></b>Ask thoughtful questions that show you're familiar and actually interested in the company or the individual. For example, ask&nbsp;about a recent project or accomplishment of the person's company.<span>&nbsp;This means doing your research.</span></p> 
       <p><i>Forbes&nbsp;</i>contributor and&nbsp;CEO of&nbsp;Digital Talent Agents&nbsp;John Hall said t<span>he more <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhall/2013/01/15/the-8-networking-rules-you-should-never-break/" title="Link: http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhall/2013/01/15/the-8-networking-rules-you-should-never-break/">information you have about a person, the better</a> you’ll be able to relate to him or her. At the very least, he suggests to look at their LinkedIn profile to get a feel for the different ways you can work together.&nbsp;</span></p> 
       <h2>4. Being <i>Too</i> Prepared</h2>

       <p>I know it's been said that there's no such thing as being too prepared, but sometimes that's the very thing that may hurt you. You want to avoid going in with a rigid agenda. It's good to have an overall plan, but be wary of the blinders you put on. Keep an open mind and leave those preconceived notions at the door. You never know what hidden opportunity you may miss out on because you were too busy sticking to your plan and fulfilling your expectations.&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>For example, I once waltzed into an internship fair with the very specific intention to only seek out writing opportunities in print. It wasn't until the very end — at the food table, of course — that I struck up casual conversation with a representative for a TV show. She mentioned a unique writing opportunity at the station, that would also introduce me to TV production, which was something I'd always entertained as an idea, but never thought about seriously. It turned out to be one of the best internship experiences I've had.<br></p>

       <p>That being said, it's important to have a good idea of what you want. You don't have to have every nitty gritty detail mapped out perfectly, but be sure to present yourself with a clear-enough focus. Not being specific enough shows problematic indecisiveness that suggests you may not be a person with whom people can effectively work. You can have a variety of interests and goals, as long as they're not thrown all over the place in conversation.&nbsp;As&nbsp;Darrah Brustein, founder of&nbsp;Network Under 40<i>&nbsp;</i>told&nbsp;<i>Forbes,&nbsp;</i>the more&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2014/07/22/17-tips-to-survive-your-next-networking-event/" title="Link: http://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2014/07/22/17-tips-to-survive-your-next-networking-event/">specific you can be about what you do</a>, the easier it'll be for others to help you achieve that.&nbsp;Try to find a consistent thread amongst everything to ensure that those aspirations — however lofty and scattered — can become a reality.&nbsp;</p>

So, with the help of Frank Underwood's social graces, here are seven of the most common networking mistakes to avoid.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e1.

Asking for things is difficult and puts you in a vulnerable position, especially when you're trying to pitch yourself to someone. When networking starts to become a chore, no one ends up happy. Do it honestly. Know why you're doing it and identify what you want out of it. At the same time, it's not all about you. If you flip your mindset to think of what the other person wants and how you can help them achieve it, that's when the magic happens. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eAlong with this, it's good to be more selective in who you choose to network with. According to Dean Mercado a marketing strategist, in an \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onlinemarketingmuscle.com/how-to-choose-where-to-network/\" title=\"Link: http://www.onlinemarketingmuscle.com/how-to-choose-where-to-network/\"\u003earticle for Online Marketing Muscle\u003c/a\u003e, choosing your target market — aka finding people in industries you're interested in and what events they attend — is one of the most important parts of networking. Don't exchange business cards with absolutely every human you come in contact with. While having a big network is helpful, a network with dead-end connections made by spreading yourself too thin won't be as effective.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e2.
