             <p>These are questions that are challenging institutions in UK further and higher education (<span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="further education"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr></span> and <span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="higher education"><abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr></span>).&nbsp;</p>
             <p>This guide will address key challenges like these and support institutions to develop digital environments which meet students’ expectations and help them to progress to higher levels of study and employment.</p>
             <p>By sharing research findings and good practice, we aim to support staff and students to make the most effective use of digital technologies by kickstarting discussions within institutions and directing people to guidance, resources and opportunities to collaborate with others in the sector who are working on similar issues.&nbsp; The emphasis is on developing solutions appropriate to your context and the needs of your students and your institution.</p>
             <p>The snapshot case studies used to illustrate key points within the guide are drawn primarily from <span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="further education"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr></span> and <span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="higher education"><abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr></span> institutions and contain key lessons and examples of innovative practice relevant to both sectors.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>The emphasis is on developing solutions appropriate to your context and the needs of your students and your institution.</p>
             <h2>Support from Jisc</h2>
             <p>All institutions supported by Jisc have a <a href="/contact/your-account-manager">dedicated account manager</a> who can help them develop digital capability solutions.&nbsp; The service is scalable, ranging from brief advice to more detailed and involved support.</p>

             </blockquote>
             <h2>Changing student demographics and changing relationships</h2>
             <p>For higher education&nbsp;this includes changing student demographics with more mature, part-time, distance and online students, increasing student numbers (including the recruitment of more students from outside the UK), exploration of overseas markets, strained or declining finances and pressure on physical estates and the need to develop employability skills in graduates.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>In addition to strained and declining finances, <span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="further education"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr></span> is charged with meeting the needs of a diverse student body spanning a broad spectrum of levels as well as developing new relationships with employers to:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>Secure greater employer engagement</li>
              <li>Enhance the vocational relevance of training programmes</li>
              <li>Increase ‘line of sight’ to employment</li>
             </ul>
             <p>A planned government review of post-16 education and training institutions will also impact on the communities that colleges serve.&nbsp; The intention of the review is to</p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>“enable a transition towards fewer, larger, more resilient and efficient providers, and more effective collaboration across a range of institution types”<br><strong><a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/post-16-education-and-training-institutions-review">Post-16 education and training institutions review policy paper: 20 July 2015</a></strong></p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>Furthermore, student fees and student loans for both&nbsp;FE&nbsp;and&nbsp;HE&nbsp;are changing the relationship between students and institutions.&nbsp; There is an increased recognition of the proactive role that students can play as partners in their education that looks to the future and is both rewarding and satisfying.</p>
             <h2>Changes in the way we work</h2>
             <p>A <a href="http://www.policyconnect.org.uk/sites/site_pc/files/report/602/fieldreportdownload/skillscommission-stillintune.pdf">Skills Commission report</a> has identified that the way in which people work is changing with technology being a part of the change.&nbsp; Their research indicates that flexibility is a major characteristic of the way people now work and that technology is changing job roles and has influenced the way we communicate and work.</p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>“The application of new technologies is changing the identity and the skills needs of industries, particularly as greater interconnectivity drives innovation between sectors.”<br><a href="http://www.policyconnect.org.uk/sites/site_pc/files/report/602/fieldreportdownload/skillscommission-stillintune.pdf"><strong>Still in tune?

             <h2>Strategic importance of digital technologies</h2>
             <p>With so many competing pressures educational leaders do not always recognise the strategic and operational importance of digital technology or realise the potential transformative effect this could have on their institutions, the wider sector, employers and society.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>This potential has been identified by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (<span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills"><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr></span>) in their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/320242/bis-14-841-government-response-to-recommendations-from-the-FELTAG-action-plan.pdf">response to the FELTAG recommendations</a> and is providing the impetus for the <span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="further education"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr></span> and skills sector to deliver more learning online, to develop the capability and capacity of the <span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="further education"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr></span> and skills workforce to empower learners to exploit technology.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>The 2014&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/digcap">UCISA digital capabilities survey report</a> makes recommendations to <span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="higher education"><abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr></span> on creating effective, strategic cross-institutional approaches to developing digital capabilities.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

             <p>This should&nbsp;encompass:&nbsp;physical spaces and digital services; workforce capability; student and staff digital literacy skills; and, the effective gathering and use of information on student expectations and experiences of technology to inform future institutional strategies.</p>
             <h2>Origin of challenges and research</h2>
             <p>This guide draws on <a href="/rd/projects/digital-student">our digital student project</a>, an extensive and ongoing research and consultation process involving students and staff as well as work that we have been conducting across the whole student experience theme including:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>The <a href="/student-innovation">Summer of Student Innovation</a></li>
              <li>Work on <a href="/guides/developing-students-digital-literacy">developing students digital literacies and staff capabilities</a></li>
              <li><a href="/blog/evaluating-digital-services-a-visitors-and-residents-approach-11-mar-2014">Evaluating digital services: a visitors and residents approach</a></li>

             <p><a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SJ3fWmLEKnQ?rel=0">Watch our digital student interviews from 2013.</a></p>
             <p>From this research Jisc has identified seven key challenges that institutions need to address as part of their efforts to enhance the student digital environment.&nbsp; These are to:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>Deliver a relevant digital curriculum</li>
              <li>Deliver an inclusive digital student experience</li>
              <li>Deliver a robust, flexible digital environment</li>
              <li>Engage in dialogue with students about their digital experience and empower them to develop their digital environment</li>
              <li>Develop coherent policies for ‘bring your own’ (devices, services and data)</li>
              <li>Prepare and support students and staff to study and work successfully with digital technologies</li>
              <li>Take a strategic, whole-institution approach to developing the student digital experience</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Our <span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="further education"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr></span> digital student research identified some additional challenges for <span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="further education"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr></span>:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>Learners’ digital experiences are strongly dependent on the confidence and capabilities of their teachers, but currently staff workload and career pathways are hindering staff development</li>
              <li>Lecturers are not well-supported and incentivised to integrate digital resources into their teaching. Where there is high staff turnover or heavy reliance on casual staff, this is exacerbating the problem</li>
              <li>The lack of funding for research into the learner experience in the <span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="further education"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr></span> and skills sector leads to out of date research and assumptions about students’ level of digital literacy.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>As in higher education, there is also the challenge of ensuring a consistent student experience using technology, by providing support for all users, a relevant digital curriculum and a robust, flexible digital environment.</p>
             <p>We have produced a <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6096/1/FE_digital_student_brief_2015.pdf">brief for FE college leaders and managers</a> on <span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="further education"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr></span> learner expectations and experiences of technology, outlining the key challenges and learning provider solutions as well as a more <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6083/1/JR0043_FE_DIGITALSTUDENT_REPORT_A.pdf">comprehensive report of the FE digital student study.</a></p>
             <h2>Who is this guide for?</h2>
             <p>This guide is aimed at a wide range of staff in UK higher education, further education and skills including:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>Learning and teaching staff, trainers and assessors</li>
              <li>Librarians and learning resources staff</li>
              <li>Student support services</li>
              <li>IT</li>
              <li>Estates</li>
              <li>Staff and educational developers</li>
              <li>E-learning/ILT staff</li>
              <li>Senior managers with responsibility for the digital experience/environment</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>How to use this guide</h2>
             <p>There is no set order for working through the seven challenges and each can be tackled individually.&nbsp; We don’t necessarily envisage that you will work through the challenges in a linear fashion.&nbsp; Rather, we hope that you will select the challenge that seems most relevant to your current situation and work from there.&nbsp; The exception is that of taking a strategic, whole-institution approach: this is the central challenge which will support and be informed by all the others.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Each challenge ends with suggestions for how you could make a difference to the student experience in your organisation.</p>

              <p>“Staff and students have different digital literacy skills sets.&nbsp; Combining the digital bravery (R Sharpe and G Benfield) of the students with staff knowledge and expertise of a given domain can allow you to critically investigate digital practice in a subject.”<br><strong>Jim Pettiward, blended learning facilitator, Centre for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching (CELT), London Metropolitan University</strong></p>
             </blockquote>
             <h2>Fulfil student expectations</h2>
             <p>The pervasive use of technology in so many aspects of our lives means that students will come to further or higher education with some experience of technology and the expectation that it will feature in their learning journey.&nbsp; They will expect digital services like Wi-Fi to be freely and easily accessible as a core entitlement and that efficient administration processes and wrap around services will support their overall experience.&nbsp;</p>
             <h2>Explain how technology will be used to support learning within the curriculum</h2>
             <p>Our research <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5572/1/JR0006_STUDENTS_EXPECTATIONS_EXEC_SUMMARY_v2.pdf">on student experiences and expectations of technology</a> (Beetham, H and White, D. 2013) shows that the personal digital skills that students already have will vary widely and some may find it difficult to transfer these skills into academic practice.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Our <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6083/1/JR0043_FE_DIGITALSTUDENT_REPORT_A.pdf">FE digital student research</a> reinforces this point and advises against making assumptions about students' experience with, or attitudes towards, technology - reporting that students generally felt less confident and needed more ongoing support than their lecturers expected.</p>
             <p>Make it clear how and why technology is being used to support learning from induction and at the start of new modules to establish an institutional digital entitlement.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Embed digital activities</h3>
             <p>Reinforce this by embedding digital activities and assessment opportunities as part of the curriculum design to set the expectation that students will use technology throughout their study.&nbsp; Accompany this with responsive support to establish a base level of digital literacy and confidence and a platform to explore and develop subject and discipline specific uses.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Technology can be particularly useful in bridging the gap between study and work.&nbsp; Apprentices and students on work placement can use technology to access resources, monitor their own progress and keep in touch with employers, tutors and assessors.</p>
             <h3>Build confidence</h3>
             <p>Students appreciate time to develop their practice in a safe environment – a metaphorical walled garden – with paths out to a more public domains as their confidence and competence expands.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Our&nbsp;<a href="/guides/evaluating-digital-services">detailed guide to evaluating digital services: a visitors and residents approach</a>&nbsp; suggests a mapping activity that can help users to reflect on their digital practices, how they use technology and for what purpose.</p>

             <h3>Encourage independent learning and new approaches</h3>
             <p>As students progress along their learning journey and embedded digital activities become the norm reducing the explicit signposting of technology may be preferable in order to encourage a more independent and responsive style.&nbsp; This will allow space for new approaches to emerge, developed by staff and students, to reflect the changing environment, emerging technologies and to respond to learner needs and task requirements.</p>

             <p>Our research shows that disciplinary context is important and that students respond most favourably to authentic and meaningful digital activities that are directly linked to, and embedded in, their programmes of learning and assessment and that are relevant to their future employment ambitions.</p>
             <p>In <span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="further education"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr></span>, the strong focus on preparing learners for the workplace also raises learners' expectations that colleges will provide industry standard hardware and software.</p>
             <p>Confident modelling of this use by lecturers emphasises the professional value.&nbsp; This works best when aligned to opportunities for students to practice and become proficient themselves.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Differentiated approaches</h3>
             <p>The variety of contexts and differentiated learning programmes means that what is relevant for a given programme of study will need to be carefully thought through and perhaps applied differently in different circumstances.</p>

               <p>At <a href="http://www.howcollege.ac.uk">Heart of&nbsp;Worcestershire College</a> their innovative Scheduled Online Learning and Assessment (SOLA) approach to blended learning means they have already met the target and are approaching 20% in a number of key areas. The SOLA model has been applied to all Level 2 and 3 full-time programmes of study.&nbsp; It involves highly-structured, weekly online learning sessions delivered through the virtual learning environment.</p>
               <p>This model has had a positive impact within the college allowing efficiency savings of over £200k per year. Success rates in the college have improved by over 11% since blended learning was first implemented and in addition to this learners develop crucial independent learning skills.&nbsp;</p>

             <p>Curriculum design will continue to evolve in response to new developments, analysis and technologies.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Some suggestions for how you could use technology to develop a relevant digital curriculum in your institution include:&nbsp;</p>
             <h2>Starting out?</h2>
             <ul>
              <li>Design for all – <a href="/guides/enhancing-the-digital-student-experience/deliver-an-inclusive-digital-student-experience">inclusive learning&nbsp;</a>benefits&nbsp;all students</li>
              <li>Create learning and assessment activities which require students to communicate ideas, express views, produce artefacts, analyse data and solve problems using digital technologies, not simply to consume digital information</li>
              <li>Explore and promote the pedagogical benefits that different technologies offer with staff and students – take a look at our&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17h11OH4MuSTsYNpsXMPNyuPNWeCOb1k-qryNg46-vOk/edit?pli=1">list of digital experiences</a>&nbsp;for ideas you could adopt or adapt to suit your own needs</li>
              <li>Ensure that digital enhancements and opportunities are considered in curriculum design and review processes</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Embedding change?</h2>
             <ul>
              <li>Be clear about the digital entitlement that you offer for your students and how you expect learners to use technology in their programmes of learning</li>
              <li>Contextualise by promoting authentic workplace and professional digital practices using industry standard software and equipment (or reputable open source alternatives)</li>
              <li>Review workload modelling and timetabling to ensure they are sufficiently flexible to facilitate innovative delivery models</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Going further?</h2>
             <ul>
              <li>Ensure staff are rewarded and recognised for trying different modes of learning</li>
              <li>Map assessment practices across whole programmes of learning to ensure variety, avoid duplication of effort</li>
              <li>Use digital activities to build links beyond the course to support the transition to professional lives</li>
             </ul>

Draffan, research staff in web and internet science, University of Southampton</strong></p>
             </blockquote>
             <h3>Avoid common errors</h3>
             <p>While use of technology and digital content opens up new opportunities it is still possible to create accessibility barriers, for example, use of podcasts without transcripts or text summaries.</p>
             <h2>Meet your legal responsibilities and ‘reasonable expectations’</h2>
             <p>Universities, &nbsp;colleges and other learning providers have a legal responsibility to take measures to ensure that learning is accessible to all and to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ under the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents">Equality Act 2010</a> to anticipate and respond to learner needs.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Prepare for legislative changes and variances in funding rules</h3>
             <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/higher-education-student-support-changes-to-disabled-students-allowances-dsa">Changes to the way Disabled Student Allowances (DSA) come into effect from 1 September 2015</a> require higher education institutions to give greater consideration to the delivery and assessment of their courses and how best to provide support.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>The changes are intended to rebalance the responsibilities between government funding and institutional support and to encourage greater use of the technology available to reduce reliance on DSA funding for those with mild difficulties.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>In colleges and learning providers, there is an expectation that technology will be used to support high needs students (HNS).&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Guidelines on how funding for HNS in further education is administered is available from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-education-high-needs-funding#high-needs-funding">Education Funding Agency</a> (students up to 18 and young people 19-25 who have a Learning Difficulty Assessment or Education, Health and Care Plan) and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-funding-rules-2014-to-2015">Skills Funding Agency</a> (students over the age of 19).&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Learning providers will also be aware that all awarding bodies<a class="footnote" id="footnoteref2_ohdq7h7" href="#footnote2_ohdq7h7">2</a> now have to offer an accessible digital version of formal exams.</p>
             <h3>What is reasonable?</h3>
             <p>Our learner-focused guide <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5902/1/transitions-reading-accessible.pdf">‘reasonable expectations’</a> outlines what accessibility and assistive technology support a learner can reasonably to expect to be available in post-16 providers.&nbsp;</p>
             <h2><a id="keypolicies" name="keypolicies"></a>Use policies to establish and reinforce accessibility and inclusion</h2>
             <p>As organisations seek to enhance the digital student experience it is vital that accessibility is at the forefront of planning, procurement, training and delivery. Joining up policy to practice is perhaps the most significant way of ensuring that technology is routinely considered as one way of making a sustainable difference.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Amplify accessibility benefits</h3>
             <p>Policy decisions that ignore accessibility are bad for disabled learners and also potentially create negative impacts for many more learners and the whole organisation, including substantial legal risks.&nbsp; Conversely, policies that embed accessibility offer benefits far beyond their target audience as the table below shows:</p>

              <li>Introduce digital issues to curriculum design and review processes</li>
              <li>Involve disabled people in planning and testing new systems, resource types or teaching and learning approaches</li>
              <li>Explore some of the strategies for using technology for studying on the <a href="http://www.lexdis.org.uk/">LexDis project website</a></li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Embedding change?</h2>
             <ul>
              <li>Use your policies to establish and reinforce accessibility and inclusion including curriculum design and review processes (including alternative assessment methods)</li>
              <li>Adopt digital activities that encourage communication, participation and learner independence</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Going further?</h2>
             <ul>
              <li>Review digital practices and strategies such as bring your own device for their impact on students with different backgrounds and preferences</li>
              <li>Involve a wide range of students as advisors on digital projects and representatives of the student voice</li>
              <li>Ensure procurement processes have accessibility as a key criterion in order to reduce support costs later down the line</li>

             <p>Easy and secure access to institutional networks and wireless local area networks (Wi-Fi) are generally available at most institutions although these do not always work as seamlessly as students would like.&nbsp;</p>
             <p><a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6083/1/JR0043_FE_DIGITALSTUDENT_REPORT_A.pdf">FE digital student research</a> revealed that some learners who are skilled and enthusiastic in their use of technology found their college environments restrictive and not representatives of the industries they were preparing to work in.</p>
             <p>Institutions should endeavour to provide these free of charge and with sufficient bandwidth and coverage to extend to all areas of the campus and halls of residence.&nbsp;</p>

             <p>The common use of online platforms as a means of making information and resources more widely available means that free Wi-Fi is considered a basic entitlement by many students<a class="footnote" id="footnoteref1_fdgjw2c" href="#footnote1_fdgjw2c">1</a>.&nbsp; The growth in use of tablet computers, mobile phones and other portable and personal technologies requires institutions to make their systems and content accessible to a wider variety of devices.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Institutions are legally obliged to ensure their IT infrastructures are accessible and support the use of assistive technologies.</p>
             <p>Many disabled learners use the built-in assistive technologies in their phones and tablet devices to access course content therefore good Wi-Fi provision may be a way of improving disability support while simultaneously reducing the need for additional assistive hardware or software.</p>
             <h3>Single sign-on and federated access</h3>
             <p>Students find it frustrating to have to log-on separately to different systems like virtual learning environments (VLEs), library systems, online resource and data sets etc.&nbsp; Our guide on <a href="/guides/identity-management">access and identity management</a> provides guidance on federated access and single sign-on including a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65ct24b9IAI">introductory animation</a>.</p>

             <h2>Recognise the importance of personal digital practices</h2>
             <blockquote>
              <p>“Each digital ambassador came from a different subject discipline, used different tools and had individual preferences as to how they used those tools.&nbsp; This meant that we were able to cater for the needs of students from a variety of faculties and every student went away from the workshops with something of relevance to them.”<br><strong>Helen Long’a Tongu, Student, London Metropolitan University</strong></p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>The distinction between academic use of technology and social use is blurred – many students use personal networks and social media to support their learning as well as a broad range of apps and software, much of which will not necessarily be provided or supported by the institution.</p>
             <h3>Offer core and extended services</h3>
             <p>One approach is the onion or layered approach adopted by <a href="http://www2.mmu.ac.uk">Manchester Metropolitan University</a> whereby core services are identified that will be made available to all students with appropriate support and further outer layers are wrapped-around the core offer, providing or highlighting other technologies that may be available with varying levels of support.</p>
             <h2>Explore open and disaggregated options</h2>
             <p>Students operate in an open environment where a significant quantity of information is easily available.&nbsp; Facilitating access to this content and data can provide variety in learning, support innovation and help to build and maintain partnerships.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Maximise use of resources</h3>
             <p>Signposting quality resources and <a href="/guides/developing-students-digital-literacy">developing digital literacy skills</a> will ensure students and staff can analyse the quality of resources for themselves and are aware of protocols governing copyright, intellectual property and acceptable use.&nbsp; In turn, this will build confidence in using and sharing open resources as well as creating new resources where lack of appropriate resources is an issue.</p>

               <p>With the introduction of a greater variety of technologies and the desire to encourage students to bring their own devices the college identified a need to improve the speed and resilience of digital services and has become the first college to sign up to Jisc’s&nbsp;<a href="/news/first-fe-college-joins-national-data-centre-for-education-and-research-03-aug-2015">shared data centre&nbsp;</a>for education and research.</p>

             <h2>Secure affiliation and provide clear boundaries</h2>
             <p>The digital opportunities you afford your students are part of your overall learning offer.&nbsp; Students may not realise the full extent of the resources and facilities you offer or be able to distinguish services paid for by the institution from those freely available in the public domain.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Apply institutional branding</h3>
             <p>Similarly, they may not know when they are in a closed or institutional space or when they are crossing boundaries into more open spaces.&nbsp; Consider applying an institutional brand or identity to build student loyalty and make sure that students realise the full extent of the digital offer provided by your institution, including any outsourced services and support.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Moving from ‘walled gardens’ to public domains</h3>
             <p>In the early stages of study students need opportunities to practice in secure and closed spaces where perceived failure carries a low risk.&nbsp; As they progress through their learning they need access to more open spaces and to learn how to manage their academic and professional identities.&nbsp; Providing semi-permeable boundaries that provide a ‘walled garden’ with pathways out to more public spaces can support this transitional process.</p>

             <h2>Reprofile IT support services to ensure a flexible user-centred approach</h2>
             <p>Robust technical systems are a given but alongside this there must be support for users (students and staff) that focus on developing their digital capabilities, including use of personal and mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>This is especially important given that our <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6083/1/JR0043_FE_DIGITALSTUDENT_REPORT_A.pdf">FE digital student research</a> revealed that learners are strongly dependent on the confidence and capabilities of their teachers when using technology and the recommendation that staff and students should be supported to use digital technologies in more innovative ways.</p>
             <p>The technologies, services and support options should be clearly signposted to all users and comprehensively referenced in induction sessions and at key points throughout programmes of learning. Similar support should also be made available to support all those engaged in curriculum redesign.</p>

             <h3>Actively engage all stakeholders</h3>
             <p>Invite all stakeholders and user groups including disabled students and the Students' Union, to play an active role in making decisions on developing the digital environment to establish a user-centred approach.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Offer a range of different opportunities to engage these stakeholders including encouraging and consulting with informal user groups and special interest groups (SIG) that may be trying out particular technologies.</p>
             <h2><a id="data" name="data"></a>Help users to access and work with personal data</h2>
             <p>So much data is collected but it only has any real value when it is analysed, interpreted and used to inform practice and performance.&nbsp; Student dashboard systems that draw on institutional data sets and learner analytics can help students to manage their academic progress and learning experience.&nbsp;</p>

             <h3>Customise information</h3>
             <p>Systems need to provide customised data and services tailored to the needs of individuals rather than to push generic data and information sets to large groups.&nbsp; Students appreciate being able to personalise the notifications they receive via the devices and services they choose.</p>
             <p><a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5657/1/Learning_analytics_report.pdf">Learning analytics: the current state of play in UK higher and further education</a> looks at the uses and intentions behind the use of learner analytics in 12 institutions and one organisation that provides outsourced services to other institutions.&nbsp; The report explores some of the legal and ethical issues involved.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Following recommendations from phase one and two of the <a href="/rd/projects/digital-student">digital student project</a>, Jisc is exploring the development of a prototype service to support the collection and analysis of data on student expectations, experiences, attitudes and satisfaction with digital technologies in their studies in UK higher and further education.</p>

             <h2>Provide clarity, consistency and equality of access</h2>
             <p>Different courses require different technologies and approaches but students will quickly become aware of any variances in provision or lack of parity in resourcing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure students can see that there is a rational approach to procurement and make the reasons for any differences clear.</p>
             <h3>A level playing field</h3>
             <p>Although some institutions are providing students with personal tablets to create a level playing field there are many ways to tackle issues of equality of access, ease of curriculum development and the development of digital literacy skills which do not require significant investment, for example: providing materials online, out-of-hours access, specific resource rooms and even materials on a USB drive&nbsp; Consider what flexible provision and support can be made available and how this can be tailored to meet individual requirements.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

             <h2>Starting out?</h2>
             <ul>
              <li>Consult stakeholders including students – find out what works well and what frustrates them when using institutional systems and involve them in designing and testing solutions</li>
              <li>Strengthen affinity with students by promoting the digital resources and services you offer to your students</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Embedding change?</h2>
             <ul>
              <li>Create flexible places for learning and collaborative learning</li>
              <li>Adopt a user-centred approach that focuses on supporting people rather than systems</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Going further?</h2>
             <p>Explore how learner analytics could be used to benefit your learners and inform future developments and be aware of the <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/code-of-practice-for-learning-analytics">code of practice for learning analytics</a>, which sets out the responsibilities of educational institutions to ensure that learning analytics is carried out responsibly, appropriately and effectively.</p>

             <p>In recent years the focus has moved away from listening to students’ views to engaging in meaningful and collaborative dialogue and partnership initiatives to identify what helps or hinders learning.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/digcap">UCISA Digital Capabilities Survey</a> reports that 30% of respondents are working with students as change agents with another 46% of respondents ‘working towards’ this.</p>
             <h3>Beyond surveys</h3>
             <p>Surveys provide vital information but over-use can lead to ‘survey fatigue’ and the tendency is to ask the questions and prioritise the issues that the institution thinks are important which may differ from those identified by students.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>A combination of surveys, statistical data and collaborative exploration, perhaps using our <a href="/guides/evaluating-digital-services">evaluating digital services: a visitors and residents approach</a> mapping process, will provide a richer discourse and lead to deeper understanding for all and potentially the co-design of new solutions to jointly identified problems.&nbsp; It is vital that such feedback is acted upon and that students continue to be actively engaged throughout the development and implementation process.</p>
             <h3>Principles of student engagement</h3>
             <p><a href="http://tsep.org.uk/">The Student Engagement Partnership</a> (TSEP) have identified a set of <a href="http://tsep.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/4-8f8ea0c4180f64d078700886483e4a08/2014/09/The-Principles-of-Student-Engagement.pdf">principles of student engagement</a> covering learning and teaching, the quality assurance and enhancement processes and decision making, governance and strategy.</p>

             <h2>Respond to different needs</h2>
             <p>There is no such thing as ‘a typical student’.&nbsp; Rather, there will be a multiplicity of different and distinct user groups with different needs, experiences, backgrounds and aspirations who are managing sometimes complex work, social and personal commitments and adopting varying modes of study.&nbsp; Effective use of technology can enhance the learning experience by, for example, providing additional channels of support or opening up enriched opportunities for learning and communicating for those who may otherwise find it difficult to participate.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Personal and contextualised learning</h3>
             <p>The challenge is for institutions to <a href="/guides/enhancing-the-digital-student-experience/deliver-an-inclusive-digital-student-experience">create an inclusive environment</a> where students feel that their personal learning experience is important, that their learning needs will be met and that they will be both supported and challenged as they prepare for future work and study.&nbsp; In a digital society, making innovative and appropriate use of technology is an essential part of that preparation, contextualised according to the subject or discipline studied.</p>
             <p>Students who feel an affinity with their learning institutions and who feel the institution cares about their experience are more likely to succeed, to maintain good relationships beyond their initial study and contribute through alumni activities.</p>
             <h2>Advantages of joint enterprise</h2>
             <p>The fast pace of change is often cited as a barrier in terms of staff keeping abreast of technological developments and yet feedback from students tells us that they are less concerned at what equipment is used and more concerned that it is used appropriately, purposefully and competently with clear benefits for the learning experience (Beetham, H and White, D (2013), <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5572/1/JR0006_STUDENTS_EXPECTATIONS_EXEC_SUMMARY_v2.pdf">students’ expectations and experiences of the digital environment</a>,&nbsp; Jisc).&nbsp;</p>
             <p>The perception that students are more confident in using technology than staff is too simplistic and an over-generalisation.&nbsp; Both groups have different skills sets and expertise to contribute and it may be more appropriate to think about internet users as having&nbsp;‘<a href="/blog/evaluating-digital-services-a-visitors-and-residents-approach-11-mar-2014">visitor’ or ‘resident’</a> motivations (A Le Cornu, D White).&nbsp;</p>
             <p>It is clear from our work on the <a href="/student-innovation">Summer of Student Innovation</a> (SoSI) and research on <a href="/guides/what-students-really-want">what students really want</a> that there is no shortage of innovative ideas and well-considered solutions to student identified problems.</p>

             <p>Wherever you start or whatever progress you have already made engagement is a continually evolving cultural process and there will always be new opportunities emerging to develop the digital student experience.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Some suggestions for how you might take this work forward include:</p>
             <h2>Starting out?</h2>
             <ul>
              <li>Capture and analyse what students say they want and do and compare this with what they actually do</li>
              <li>Identify or create opportunities for meaningful dialogue – perhaps use the <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5872/1/JLF0002_digitalstudent_POSTERS_ALL.pdf">digital students are different posters</a> and <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5873/1/JISC_digital_student_postcards.pdf">enhancing the digital student experience: conversations that count postcards</a> to stimulate discussion or explore our <a href="http://digitalstudent.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2015/02/19/conducting-learner-experience-focus-groups/">resources designed to assist providers to conduct learner research</a></li>
              <li>Consider whether <a href="http://digitalstudent.jiscinvolve.org/wp/files/2015/01/JFL0003_FEDS_Social-Media-Learners-Conversations.pdf">using social media can help you to engage learners in conversations about their learning</a></li>
              <li>Take care not to treat students as one homogenous group and to recognise subject or discipline differences and needs</li>
              <li>Recognise also that there may be movement or transiency in terms of individual student engagement with changing commitments and&nbsp;academic pressures. The structure of the&nbsp;academic year means there may be times when students are easily able to participate and times when this is more difficult – plan for these from the outset</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Embedding change?</h2>
             <ul>
              <li>Use the <a href="http://tsep.org.uk/resources/">TSEP principles of engagement</a> to develop and promote initiatives that model collaboration between staff and students (user need aspects as well as curriculum, employability and digital literacy development initiatives)</li>
              <li>Use the <a href="/guides/developing-successful-student-staff-partnerships/viewpoints">Viewpoints toolkit</a> comprising effective practice points, prompt questions, top tips, workshop and planning activities as well as links to sector resources to help you develop a student-staff partnership model suited to your particular needs and your institutional culture.</li>
              <li>Explore the <span class="lexicon-term has-tooltip" title="National Union of Students"><abbr title="National Union of Students">NUS</abbr></span> <a href="http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/winning-for-students/resources/building-a-framework-for-partnership-with-students">Framework for Partnership with Students&nbsp;</a>and their <a href="http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/resources/a-manifesto-for-partnership">manifesto for partnership</a></li>
              <li>Make funding available for collaborative student-staff initiatives and promote opportunities to participate</li>
              <li>Encourage students and staff to sign up for the <a href="http://can.jiscinvolve.org/wp/change-leader-award/">change agents’ network change leader award</a>.</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Going further?</h2>
             <ul>
              <li>Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6uDpnlwXk8&amp;list=PLbKeiLya4JyDJ2soh2cTlSAdTquLp8Kr0#t=12">FASTECH video case study</a> – showing how students at the University of Winchester and Bath Spa University are working in partnership with staff to transform the assessment and feedback landscape</li>
              <li>Empower and reward students by ensuring their successes are recognised and promoted</li>

             <blockquote>
              <p>“Student focus groups are an integral part of our system design processes – our systems have to work across all campuses and students need to be able to access resources from anywhere via their phones and mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>We consult students on aspects such as layout and appearance and aim to present things in a user-friendly way for both students and staff.”<br><strong>Michael Malone, director of curriculum, South Eastern Regional College (SERC)</strong></p>
             </blockquote>
             <h2>Defining ‘bring your own’ (BYO)</h2>
             <p>‘Bring your own’ is the term used to describe the use of personal devices, services, data, apps and software in institutional settings.&nbsp; Many institutions manage this through a policy or set of policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
             <h2>Investigate the needs of BYO users</h2>
             <p>BYO use introduces a tension between the institutional need to gather and manage data in closed digital systems and the desire by students and staff to use systems outside the control of the institution and push against restrictions that impact on preferred ways of working.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Further tensions exist when implementing BYO in safeguarding the security of institutional systems, data protection and other legal responsibilities.</p>

              <p>“The student experience is inherently digital. It is up to us whether we play an active role in shaping that experience or not.</p>
              <p>As educators we can support positive digital practices - those critical, thoughtful, professional and scholarly uses of technology that we know give learners the best chance of success.</p>
              <p>Or we can leave them to their own devices, which I believe has many risks for their learning and for our relevance as educators in the modern world.”<br><strong>Helen Beetham, consultant in higher education</strong></p>

             <h2>Use digital technologies to establish online relationships</h2>
             <p>For many students the relationship with an institution begins online – the quality of information and the experience during initial investigations and the responses to any queries will make an impression.&nbsp; Increasingly institutions are reaching out to prospective students to offer preparatory and open study modules to establish relationships before formal study commences; to maintain interest and facilitate independent learning; to introduce key topics; or perhaps to support widening participation.&nbsp;</p>

             <p>Giving guidance on recommended devices, the software and services students can expect to use during their course of study and explaining how technology will be used in the curriculum will provide clarity and establish the expectation that digital activities will feature in the overall learning experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Building digital identities and professional profiles</h3>
             <p>Showing students how to develop a positive public digital identity will help to establish safe and ethical working practices and build confidence.&nbsp; Establishing use of an e-portfolio or other means of recognising and promoting achievement, and where appropriate publishing work as a digital or live Curriculum Vitae, from the outset will also help to establish a professional profile.</p>
             <p>Treat the signing-on to your institutional systems as the foundation block that will support students throughout their whole learning experience with you and consider rewarding their progress in doing so with badges, credits or some other recognition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

               <p><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/beingdigital/">Being Digital: Skills For Life Online</a> is an award-winning interactive resource developed by the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk">Open University</a> comprising a set of 40 distinct digital activities organised into four themes -&nbsp; finding information, using information, creating information, and workplace skills.&nbsp;</p>
               <p>Each activity takes no more than 10 minutes to complete and users can browse for activities that meet their immediate needs or follow one of several 'pathways'.&nbsp;</p>
               <p>The resources have been used extensively by a range of students from sixth form to doctorate programmes as well as staff.</p>

             <h3>Minimum expectations</h3>
             <p>There will still be a need to provide focused and differentiated support, training and guidance for staff as well as for students.</p>
             <p>Simple approaches like establishing minimum expectations setting out what staff should reasonably be expected to do will guide staff and provide a base level from which customised practice can develop (eg create resources in digital formats, upload resources to institutional learning platforms and adhere to basic accessibility practices).</p>

             <p>Previously we identified&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/developing-students-digital-literacy">seven elements of digital literacy</a>&nbsp;that were pertinent to both students and staff.&nbsp;This model has been recognised and well-used but research conducted as part of our <a href="/rd/projects/building-digital-capability">building digital capability project</a> highlighted emerging issues in ‘data literacy’ and ‘digital well-being’.&nbsp;</p>

               <p>In <a href="/podcasts/thriving-in-a-connected-age-digital-capability-and-digital-wellbeing-06-jul-2015">our podcast</a> Helen Beetham, leader of the&nbsp;<a href="/rd/projects/building-digital-capability">digital capabilities framework project</a>, discusses the increasing importance of digital capabilities and digital wellbeing, and the challenges that these pose to universities and colleges.</p>

             <p>We have therefore revised the model and framework to show six elements of digital capability, combining ‘information literacy’ with ‘media literacy’ as a result of feedback that suggested users had difficulty distinguishing between the two.&nbsp; Helen Beetham provides further information on the rationale for the revised model on the <a href="http://digitalcapability.jiscinvolve.org/wp/revisiting-digital-capability-for-2015/">digital capability blog</a>.</p>
             <p>These six elements of: ICT proficiency; information, data and media literacies; digital creation, innovation and scholarship; communication, collaboration and participation; digital learning and self-development; and digital identity and well-being provide opportunities for the contextualised development of personal and professional digital literacy skills.</p>
             <p>Our quick guide on <a href="/guides/developing-students-digital-literacy">developing students’ digital literacy</a> provides an overview of the topic and signposts further information and resources, while our our <a href="/guides/developing-digital-literacies">detailed guide to digital literacies</a> provides further resources, support and examples of how others are supporting digital literacy skills development.</p>

               <p>At <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk">Imperial College London</a>&nbsp;a digital literacies course - addressing all <a href="/guides/developing-students-digital-literacy">seven elements of digital literacy</a> we've identified - has been introduced into the medical curriculum (MBBS) as part of the Foundations of Clinical Practice Theme.</p>

             <p>The <a href="http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/digcap">2014 UCISA Digital Capabilities Survey</a> identified that students were generally offered greater variety in training, development and accreditation than staff.</p>
             <p>They recommend that institutions are supported to harness the potential or emerging practices to provide a broad portfolio of opportunities to motivate and reward students and staff positively.</p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>“Is our model of tailored staff training and mentoring support affordable?&nbsp; We can’t afford not to do it!&nbsp; You have to get the fundamentals right. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>When you consider the positive impact on student lives that a positive learning experience makes, then the cost is minimal -&nbsp;all it takes is for one student to be retained on a programme to recoup the cost of the staff mentoring process.”<br><strong>Michael Malone, director of curriculum and Paula Philpott, ILT pedagogy mentor co-ordinator, South Eastern Regional College (SERC)</strong></p>
             </blockquote>
             <h2>Provide clarity over contractual relationships</h2>
             <p>Students prioritise relationships with course groups, co-curricular activities, societies and friendship groups (Beetham, H and White, D (2013), <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5572/1/JR0006_STUDENTS_EXPECTATIONS_EXEC_SUMMARY_v2.pdf">students’ expectations and experiences of the digital environment</a>,&nbsp; Jisc)&nbsp; and expect these to be the main focus of their online activity.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>The contractual aspects of the relationship between students and institutions should be clear but should not dominate digital spaces.&nbsp; Policies such as acceptable use, use of own devices and others should be clearly expressed and readily available along with essential information such as access and response times to faults or queries, what support students can expect and how they can access this.</p>
             <h2>Provide meaningful and personal data</h2>
             <p>Do your students know how well they are doing?&nbsp; In an environment where greater learner independence is encouraged it makes sense to allow them greater access to their own data so they can <a href="/guides/enhancing-the-digital-student-experience/deliver-a-robust-flexible-digital-environment#data">better monitor and manage their progress.&nbsp;</a></p>
             <p><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk">The Open University</a> is piloting machine-learning based methods for early identification of students at risk of failing. <a>OU Analyse</a> compiles a list of such students and communicates this each week to the module and student support teams to help them consider appropriate support. The overall objective is to significantly improve the retention of students.</p>
             <p>Allow students to personalise the digital spaces and services they use perhaps including photographs, favourites, friends and followers on their personal dashboard.</p>

             <p>Inspiration and examples of effective support for students and staff are abundant in the sector but the challenge seems to be in identifying sufficient variety of opportunities&nbsp;to suit the culture of individual organisations.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Creating a framework in which differentiated and contextualised support can sit requires a holistic approach.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Some suggestions for how you might take this work forward include:</p>
             <h2>Starting out?</h2>
             <ul>
              <li>Review your pre-induction information and offer to consider how welcoming and supportive it is in preparing students for study at your institution</li>
              <li>Analyse the support material that you already have including existing induction materials - can any of this be repurposed and adapted for wider use?</li>
              <li>Make the relationship personal and allow students to personalise the digital spaces they use</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Embedding change?</h2>
             <ul>
              <li>Establish differentiated minimum skills and knowledge levels for staff and students and be clear about digital expectations and the role of technology in learning and teaching</li>
              <li>Provide a variety of support options for staff and students – there will naturally be some overlap and where this occurs seek to develop collaborative options that allow both parties to co-design and co-develop</li>
              <li>Develop contextualised solutions and options that allow personalisation in terms of learning goals and ambitions</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Going further</h2>
             <ul>
              <li>Plan holistically and include all those involved in the learning experience.&nbsp; Embed technological interventions and activities in all institutional strategies</li>
              <li>Be creative in the way that you reward and incentivise the achievements of both staff and students</li>

             <p>Enhancing the digital student experience involves the collaboration of many roles and stakeholders including students, schools, departments, curriculum teams and supporting services.&nbsp; For maximum impact a senior member of staff with broad influence will assume overall ownership and responsibility for driving the digital vision forward and developing and realising the digital identity of the institution.&nbsp; This leadership will be clearly communicated and publicly upheld.</p>

             <p>The vision for the digital aspects of the institution should both encompass, and be embedded in, all major strategies, especially those focusing on: learning, teaching and assessment; research and knowledge transfer; IT infrastructure and support; information services; estates; inclusion and widening participation; employability; libraries and learning resources; data management; recruitment and marketing; student services; and communication.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>One of the recommendations form <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6083/1/JR0043_FE_DIGITALSTUDENT_REPORT_A.pdf">our research into FE learners’ expectations and experiences of technology</a> is that college leaders and managers should initiate a group to develop and monitor their digital strategies.&nbsp; They further recommend that leaders and managers should take steps to ensure these strategies are informed by staff and student perspectives as well as ensuring that the strategies are underpinned by local and national evidence.</p>

In developing the tool we drew on discussions with students as to which aspects of their digital experience they feel entitled to - the things they really need to be in place if they are going to get the most from their studies.</p>
             <p>The benchmarking tool will help you to assess what your organisation is already doing to support students' digital practices and what it could do to make things better.</p>
             <h3>Satisfy other institutional priorities</h3>
             <p>You may find it useful to map how a robust digital infrastructure and a holistic approach to developing the institution’s digital capability can support other institutional priorities such as internationalism and the development of new markets or improving employer engagement to enhance the vocational relevance of learning programmes.&nbsp; This may highlight the centrality of digital technology as mission-critical to other priorities and leverage further support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Our <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/rd/projects/building-digital-capability">building digital capability</a> project is working with stakeholders and sector bodies to explore aspects of digital leadership, pedagogy and efficiency.&nbsp; The project aims to provide clear guidance over what digital skills are required, and equip leaders and staff with the tools and resources they need to improve digital capability at a local or institutional level.</p>
             <p>Establish digital technologies as a routine consideration when reviewing or planning any new project or improvement to services.</p>

             <h3>Beyond the curriculum</h3>
             <p>Explore how digital technologies can support the wider student journey and be used to address non-curriculum issues that impact on student satisfaction, eg access to wireless networks (Wi-Fi) in all areas of the institution, logging maintenance issues in student halls of residence, finding accommodation, work placements and information on bursaries, or even locating an available washing machine.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>It is interesting to note that the <a href="http://www.unite-students.com/about-us/insightreport">UNITE student insight report 2015</a> identified that for the first time students believe Wi-Fi is the most vital feature of any accommodation. 78 percent of students surveyed said Wi-Fi internet access is ‘very important’ and rated it more highly than cleanliness and cost.</p>
             <p>Explore how technology can be used to ease administration and tackle common student and staff frustrations without losing clarity on the overall purpose and main objectives.</p>
             <h2>Identify those who will carry the vision forward</h2>

             <p>The diagram offers a loose framework that may be used to inform the design or development of a holistic digital experience for students and staff.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>It identifies <a href="#drivers">significant drivers for change</a>, <a href="#enablers">key strategic enablers</a> and how these facilitate the creation of a <a href="#environment">robust, supportive and flexible environment</a> and, in turn, <a href="#cultural">a culture</a> where students and staff are empowered to make most effective use of technology to support their learning and teaching.</p>
             <p>There are many co-dependencies between the seven challenge areas we have identified as well as topics that occur in more than one of the challenge areas.&nbsp;Three strong over-arching themes have emerged throughout the guide:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>Taking a strategic approach&nbsp;to ensure the benefits of any interventions are realised</li>
              <li>Identifying and addressing&nbsp;environmental issues&nbsp;that impact on the student experience</li>
              <li>Establishing a&nbsp;culture of collaboration and openness&nbsp;where the efforts of both students and staff are recognised and rewarded</li>
             </ul>

              <div class="cx_collapsibles__target">
               <p>Broadly speaking the most significant drivers for change that are encouraging institutions to look more closely at the digital experience they offer to their students are:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>Changing student demographics</li>
                <li>The changing needs and expectations of students</li>
                <li>Economic and performance pressures</li>
                <li>Employability, vocational relevance and 'line of sight' to employment</li>
                <li>Institutional representation</li>
                <li>The need to develop new markets.</li>
               </ul>

              <div class="cx_collapsibles__target">
               <p>The number of stakeholders involved and the range of aspects to consider make it vital that clear and committed leadership is provided.&nbsp; This should be accompanied by a well-articulated vision and underpinned by values that steer and inform the culture leaders wish to create.&nbsp; Leaders will provide a defined and coherent route-map to implementation and will be responsible for any necessary change management initiatives.&nbsp; A devolved implementation model resourced by devolved funding will help to secure buy-in, facilitate the development of customised responses and empower students and staff.</p>
               <p>The importance of <a href="/guides/enhancing-the-digital-student-experience/strategic-approach">taking a strategic approach to enhancing the student digital experience</a> is discussed more fully within the guide.&nbsp;</p>

              <div class="cx_collapsibles__target">
               <p>The digital environment should be robust in terms of the reliability of systems, software, resources and facilities and also in terms of the coherence of support for users (including ‘bring your own’).&nbsp; Strategic leadership will facilitate the integrated planning processes necessary to build and maintain a suitably robust and flexible digital student experience.</p>
               <p>The digital environment should also support innovation in terms of curriculum models that are pedagogically appropriate and designed with the users in mind as well as supporting flexible approaches to delivery and assessment.&nbsp; Students expect to be able to access the resources, systems and tools that they need when they need them, without undue restrictions.</p>

              <div class="cx_collapsibles__target">
               <p>With clear leadership and a robust, flexible environment the building blocks are in place that will enable students and staff to use digital technologies most effectively in a culture that is inclusive, informative and innovative.&nbsp; This is most likely to happen where all stakeholders are actively engaged in the process, feel empowered and have a sense of ownership and/or affinity.</p>
               <p>Supporting students and staff to become confident, independent and digitally literate users of technology will enable staff to develop authentic and contextualised technological interventions that enhance students’ employability potential; including the use of technology to support each other and to network and collaborate with others.&nbsp; These skills need to be recognised and rewarded in some way just as other, perhaps, more traditional achievements are.</p>
               <p>If the all the strategic, environmental and cultural aspects are aligned then the potential for individuals and institutions is vastly enhanced in so many ways.</p>
