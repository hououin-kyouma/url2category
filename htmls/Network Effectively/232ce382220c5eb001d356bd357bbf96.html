   <h2>Identify workplace networks and use them to help build relationships </h2> 
   <p>What <em>is </em>a network?</p> 
   <p>A network includes a&nbsp;group of people who cooperate with each other. This implies people working closely together and with some crossover or connection in their purpose. </p>
   <img src="graphics/3661m_comm_networks2.gif" alt="Drawing of woman sitting at computer. She types, send a message and it is received by four people each sitting at a computer" title="This is a network"> 
   <p class="caption">This is a network</p> 
   <p>Consider whether the following constitute a network:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>work team</li> 
    <li>regional meeting of staff in the same profession</li> 
    <li>union meeting at workplace</li> 
    <li>two staff members organising a colleague’s farewell.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <h3>The importance of networking</h3> 
   <p>Networking is about recognising and taking advantage of valuable relationships to get things done and to achieve a goal.</p> 
   <p>It also involves working closely with other workers to be aware of potential and future needs or problems and devising strategies to address them. </p> 
   <p>Networking is also related to participation. Through the process of participation in issues in the workplace (people in the workplace joining together to discuss concerns and have a say in developing solutions), relationships and networks are established between people and workers in the organisation (or even in the community if your organisation provides services to the community). Networks potentially build a sense of common destiny and support. Thus, they help to empower individuals and strengthen the work team and the organisation itself. </p> 
   <p>Workers network to:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>achieve outcomes</li> 
    <li>establish credibility with relevant service providers</li> 
    <li>advocate about issues</li> 
    <li>maintain contact with other professionals</li> 
    <li>debrief about issues</li> 
    <li>have access to information about what other organisations are doing, especially those providing similar services</li> 
    <li>provide information about your own service and organisation</li> 
    <li>work collaboratively to better meet the needs of clients</li> 
    <li>establish new contacts who you may work with in the future</li> 
    <li>learn about the role, services and resources of other organisations</li> 
    <li>support joint programs or activities</li> 
    <li>provide information for policy development.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <h3>Identifying work-related networks</h3> 
   <p>Networking can occur on a formal or informal basis.</p> 
   <h4><em>Formal networks </em></h4> 
   <p>Formal networks involve structured meetings or processes. </p> 
   <p>Think of some of the formal networks you will encounter in your work.</p> 
   <p>An example of a formal network is your work team. For example:</p> 
   <blockquote> 
    <p>If you work in the sterilisation unit, your work team would be responsible for ensuring that the surgical instruments that come out of an operating theatre are logged, washed, disinfected, sterilised, packaged, logged again and stored.</p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <p>Your network, in this work situation, would include your supervisor (or team leader) and your colleagues.</p> 
   <p>Here is another example of a formal network:</p> 
   <blockquote> 
    <p>A small hospital has been having temporary problems implementing best practice standards in cleaning, disinfection and sterilisation—due to a break-down in equipment.</p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <blockquote> 
    <p>The head of the sterilising services unit attend a meeting with the manager of a larger unit in a regional hospital to discuss out-sourcing of work (to the larger unit).</p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <h4><em>Informal networks</em></h4> 
   <p>These networks may be internal or external networks.</p> 
   <p>They are the relationships you develop and build up over time with and colleagues. These networks carry lots of information in the form of facts, gossip and rumour about issues affecting your work—such as government policy initiatives, local developments or changes in services.</p> 
   <h3>Skills and attitudes for participating in networks</h3> 
   <h4><em>Professionalism</em></h4> 
   <p>When you are participating in a network, whether it is formal or informal, external or internal, you need to be mindful that you are a professional worker representing your organisation. You are ‘the face’ of the organisation and your conduct, the impression you make, the information you provide and the message you communicate needs to be clear and appropriate.</p>

   <h3>Skills to network effectively — problem solving</h3> 
   <p>Have a look at the scenario below.</p> 
   <blockquote> 
    <p>Suppose you work for in the sterilisation services unit of a hospital. There have been major concerns about the standards of practice and quality control in sterilisation services at a national level. Failure to implement best practice standards and quality control has serious implications for transmission of infections to patients and there is also the risk to the community in general. There has been a number of media reports of patients infected while in a number of hospitals in the nation.</p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <blockquote> 
    <p>Management is concerned about poor workflow and inadequately-trained sterilisation services staff and has decided to set up committees to find solutions to these problems. You are part of a small committee comprising sterilisation technology workers and your team’s task is to suggest ways to solve the workflow problem among sterilisation services technology workers.</p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <p>How do you go about solving the problem?</p> 
   <h4><em>Identify the problem</em></h4> 
   <p>First find out what precisely is the problem. For instance, could it be that staff are not familiar with work practices? Or do staff know what to do but have been taking ‘short-cuts’ as they under a lot of pressure to complete daily work targets? Do individual staff feel overworked? Do they feel unsupported? </p> 
   <p>Problem solving skills are essential to the networking process, as we need to be able to accurately identify problems so that we can assist our colleagues or work team. If you are going to suggest that certain training (or services) may help your work team, for instance, you need to be sure about what the problem or issue is in the first place. The following steps outline a problem solving process to follow.</p> 
   <h4><em>Collect data</em></h4> 
   <p>To accurately identify and define the problem, we need to collect data (or information) about the problem. This will primarily be collected by talking to your colleagues about their situation and gaining an understanding of their perception of their problem (or problems). Good interpersonal communication skills are integral to this process too. You would want your colleagues to be as objective as possible about their perception of the problem. This can be quite challenging if you do not know your colleagues well, you do not have a trusting relationship with them.</p> 
   <p>Basic information will need to be collected, such as the person’s name (if they feel comfortable telling you that) and where they live. How much information you collect depends on the complexity of the problem and the person’s willingness to share information with you. <em>You should only collect information that is relevant to the issue</em>, otherwise you may appear to be ‘stickybeaking’.</p> 
   <p><em>Note: </em>We always need to respect when people are unwilling to share information with us. You need to make clear the purpose of collecting the information, how the information will be used and how confidentiality will be maintained.</p> 
   <h4><em>Assess the data for relevance or importance</em></h4> 
   <p>Depending on the complexity of the situation, there may be many issues that are of concern to the colleagues you talk to. However, you need to help them decide on their most important priority. You need to have a starting point.</p> 
   <p>It may help to ask questions such as:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>What are your main concerns right now? </li> 
    <li>What kind of help do you need right now to help you complete your work tasks? </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>You also need to identify the people involved and their needs and concerns.</p> 
   <h4><em>Identify and assess potential solutions</em></h4> 
   <p>One you have gathered relevant information and analysed the needs and concerns of the people involved, the next step is working out the possible solutions and which solution is the most appropriate one.</p> 
   <p>This step will utilise your knowledge of what services are available in the community and also requires research skills. Further on in this topic, you will learn about different ways to find out what is available.</p> 
   <h4><em>Identify additional information required</em></h4> 
   <p>You may find in the course of the discussion with your colleagues that additional information is required in order to determine the best possible solutions.</p> 
   <h4><em>Sharing the information </em></h4> 
   <p>The final step is to decide how to present your work team’s suggestions for solutions to management.</p> 
   <h3>Gathering information</h3> 
   <p>Suppose you had to gather data about the Australian standards that your unit has to comply with.</p> 
   <p>We have acknowledged that gathering information is an essential aspect of networking. There are different ways to gather information which we are going to explore. These include:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>using the telephone book</li> 
    <li>using the telephone</li> 
    <li>approaching people personally</li> 
    <li>writing letters</li> 
    <li>accessing the Internet</li> 
    <li>using a library</li> 
    <li>asking friends and colleagues</li> 
    <li>using a resource folder or contacts list.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <h3>Writing letters</h3> 
   <p>Suppose you are writing to inform small hospitals and clinics about what your service has to offer. You will need to be professional and impressive so you get lots of responses.</p> 
   <p>Letter writing is also an important networking skill. Sometimes a letter is the first communication or contact point in a relationship with your colleagues, so you need to give the right impression. You may use letters to gain access for your client to important services that they require or are entitled to. </p> 
   <p>One of the difficult tasks that faces most workers when they sit down to write a letter is that they have to decide what information to include and what to leave out. Often clients will tell you a whole lot of details about their lives, feelings, impressions and thoughts. The best way to decide what to include in a letter is to think about the purpose of the letter (what you want to achieve) and only include information that is relevant to that purpose.</p>

   <h2>Recognise the value of networks and other work relationships in providing benefits for the team and the organisation</h2> 
   <p>The workplace is a ‘social system’. It is a myriad of networks and relationships (system) between people (social). As in any other system, there are dependent and interdependent relationships. </p> 
   <p>If the workplace is a ‘social’ system, then relationships at work seem to be a very natural outcome from the ‘intent’ of this social system. Look for a moment at the aspect of support coming from relationships at work; support in the form of resources including other people’s experiences, allies for your point of view, loyalty and standing up for others during conflict.</p> 
   <h3>Working together</h3> 
   <p>Emerging from team or group work is an inclination for individuals to collaborate, rather than work alone. <em>Collaboration </em>is a term you may have heard of before. Put simply, collaboration is working with other individuals or groups to achieve an outcome. Organisations in Australia seem to be more inclined in the modern era to encourage collaborative relationships through team structures than ever before. </p> 
   <p>When people work effectively with each other they are more motivated in their roles and are more likely to work collaboratively with others. An off-shoot to the activity of collaboration is relationship building or networking. Many organisations actively encourage positive relationship building within teams and across the organisation (eg through sports clubs, morning teas).</p>
