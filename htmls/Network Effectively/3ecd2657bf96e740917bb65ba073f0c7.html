     <h3>What is job networking?</h3> 
     <p>Job networking involves using your network of contacts to find a job quickly and easily. This network can include people you know both professionally and personally. With the growth of online social networks, your network of contacts can be even bigger than that of job seekers a decade ago, and for that reason it’s something that should definitely be utilised.</p> 
    </div> 
   </div> 
   <div class="section" id="choice2"> 
    <div class="content"> 
     <h3>Where can I network?</h3> 
     <p>If you find that your contacts are of little to no help to you, you can still attend social events and meetings targeted towards certain types of businesses, industries, and careers to help expand your network. Another way to build a larger network of contacts is to attend job fairs that are sponsored by the media or trade associations.</p> 
     <p>Another way to network that’s becoming more and more popular is online job networking. You can create an account on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook to contact and be noticed by employers or companies who you wouldn’t normally have the opportunity to talk to in person.</p>

     <h2>Before we begin: How to network effectively</h2> 
     <div class="white"> 
      <p>Being able to network successfully is a great asset in the professional world as it allows you to seek out incredible opportunities. Effective networking, on the other hand, requires hard work and persistence amongst other essential skills and traits. Here are 10 ways anyone can become an effective networker.</p> 
     </div> 
    </div> 
   </div> 
   <div class="reasons"> 
    <div class="content"> 
     <ul> 
      <li><img src="https://policecheckexpress.com.au/wp-content/themes/Intercheck/powerpage/290316/images/nr1.png"><span>Be enthusiastic</span>Be enthusiastic about yourself, your job, and the company you work for. When you enter a room, hold your head up high and tell yourself that you have just as much right to be there as everyone else. Show passion when explaining your product or service to clients, and have pride in the company you represent.</li> 
      <li><img src="https://policecheckexpress.com.au/wp-content/themes/Intercheck/powerpage/290316/images/nr2.png"><span>Be organised and prepared</span>Plan and prepare before you attend events. Find out who’s going to be there and what they’ll want to talk about, how to get there and back, what the format of the event will be, why it is being held, what to wear, when it begins and ends, why you’ve been invited and what’s expected you, and finally, where the event will be held (including parking and public transport options).</li> 
      <li><img src="https://policecheckexpress.com.au/wp-content/themes/Intercheck/powerpage/290316/images/nr3.png"><span>Ask the right questions</span>Asking the right questions at an appropriate time can get you better answers and create more business or job opportunities. Ask intelligent, insightful, and interesting questions that will help you to get to know someone better or connect with them on a deeper, more personal level. Ask others what they need and if you can provide, do so.</li> 
      <li><img src="https://policecheckexpress.com.au/wp-content/themes/Intercheck/powerpage/290316/images/nr4.png"><span>Be generous and giving</span>Don’t think about the rewards, think ‘what’s in it for you?’ Networking is about building cordial relationships with other people, which wouldn’t be possible if people didn’t like you. Give others your full attention by listening carefully and being genuinely interested in what they have to say.</li> 
      <li><img src="https://policecheckexpress.com.au/wp-content/themes/Intercheck/powerpage/290316/images/nr5.png"><span>Be reliable and trustworthy</span>Deliver assignments on time and abide by what you say. If you’ve booked an appointment at a specific time, for example, make sure you get to the venue on time. If you promised to call or send an email, do it and do it fast. It’s also important to respond quickly to emails and voicemails.</li> 
      <li><img src="https://policecheckexpress.com.au/wp-content/themes/Intercheck/powerpage/290316/images/nr6.png"><span>Be persistent</span>If you seen an opportunity, persist. Hear ‘not yet’ instead of ‘no’. It’s important to face all situations with a positive attitude and grab any opportunity that you come across.</li> 
      <li><img src="https://policecheckexpress.com.au/wp-content/themes/Intercheck/powerpage/290316/images/nr7.png"><span>Listen actively</span>Pay full attention and listen carefully to what the other person is saying. This could enhance your business or increase opportunities. You should also listen more than you talk, so that you can learn more about the other person. Remember that 80% of conversation is listening and 20% is talking.</li> 
      <li><img src="https://policecheckexpress.com.au/wp-content/themes/Intercheck/powerpage/290316/images/nr8.png"><span>Get your timing right</span>You should know when to talk and when to listen, when to enter and exit a group, and when to follow up and at what intervals.</li> 
      <li><img src="https://policecheckexpress.com.au/wp-content/themes/Intercheck/powerpage/290316/images/nr9.png"><span>Be nice, and have good manners and etiquette</span>You should be friendly, open, courteous, polite, and respectful to all. When you’re nice to others, they’ll be nice to you too. Good manners and etiquette, like focusing attention on others, listening and responding to what they’re saying, making introductions, and including other people in the conversation can make them feel valued and at ease.</li> 
      <li><img src="https://policecheckexpress.com.au/wp-content/themes/Intercheck/powerpage/290316/images/nr10.png"><span>Have a clean criminal record</span>As a networker you’ll undoubtedly have an influence over those in your network, as well as yourself. So it’s important to make sure you’re clean and clear!</li>

       <p>Within the last 10 years, I’ve attended and hosted many networking events. I’m so passionate about it as I can attribute the origin of many of my accomplishments to networking and knowing ‘the right people’. Having started my career in IT&amp;T 8 years ago, I’m now on the Board of 2 not-for-profits and co-founder of Diverse City Careers (DCC). DCC has grown much quicker than I ever could have hoped and much of this has been through the network connections I have made over the last few years.</p> 
       <p>Networking can often be thought of as an activity outside of the workplace with people you haven’t met - however, networking is also valuable within your own workplace. Getting to know people across various business functions of your organisation can help you leverage connections to progress within your current organisation.</p> 
       <p>Networking doesn’t just help you with building your connections to fast track your career or grow your own business, it also gives you valuable skills in everyday life. These include increasing confidence, active listening, conversational skills, as well as learning new things by meeting new people.</p>

       <p>Most people make the mistake of trying to make something happen. My best networking experiences have been those that allowed me to get to know a person instead of forcing a sales pitch to get my needs met.</p> 
       <p>I am more about transformational experiences than those that are solely transactional. I have met some amazing friends from networking. I think if I was only interested in how it could benefit me, I would have lost out on some amazing personal and professional relationships.</p> 
       <p>I always think it’s best to identify mentors - individuals who have certain skills that you want to obtain. When I first began in non-profit management, I sought out leaders in the field who could serve as guides and resources. They not only gave me insight into the work but they also introduced me to their network.</p> 
       <p>I also believe professional associations are another wonderful opportunity to meet others who can help you in expanding your network, especially for employment. When I typically meet someone, I usually send an email right after I’ve met them to ask if we could meet for coffee or lunch to talk further. If they are unable to assist, they might have someone in their network who can.</p> 
       <p>I think it’s imperative that, just as you water grass to make it grow, the same applies to relationships. Trust is the key in relationship building, and that takes time. People need to trust that you are who you say you are. In order to do that, you must take the time to get to know someone.</p> 
       <p>Another valuable key for me was volunteering. My first job was the result of volunteering on weekends. I didn’t realise I was being watched and my work ethic along with skillset opened the door.</p>

       <p class="bold">Tip 1: Be Where People Are</p> 
       <p>Where are people going to be? Business functions? Social functions? Chamber functions? Civic events? Charity events?</p> 
       <p>Since hermits often fail in business, get out amongst the crowds, and start engaging conversations. Few people will be coming to your house to get into your business. Maximise your exposure and make sure you have plenty of ‘face time’ with people and do it often. Be where people are. That is where the golden paycheques are in business.</p> 
       <p class="bold">Tip 2: Introduce Others to Others</p> 
       <p>Develop a host mentality. Do not wait to be introduced. Introduce yourself and take the initiative to introduce others to each other. Hosting shows strong leadership skills and many people find that magnetic. Put your hand out first to shake another. Shake firm, not wimpy. SHake full hand, not finger hand. Work the room. Don’t stay in one place. Have a goal of meeting at least seven people and engaging a conversation with them.</p> 
       <p>Since others move around, keep good eye contact. This lets people know you have a magnetic self-worth. Take charge of your space. Make sure anyone around you is included in your conversation with others. Don’t be shy. If you were hosting a party what would you do? Go do it.</p> 
       <p class="bold">Tip 3: Offer Value</p> 
       <p>Bring value to any potential relationship or it will be short-lived business wise. Bring personal, professional, or leadership value to a networking contact.</p> 
       <p>Bring a future value to them. This is the key in establishing relationships. Help them get what they want and they will help you get what you want. If people perceive value first in you - by you taking an interest in them - they will perceive value in what you do on an increasing basis. Give value first, everything else second.</p>

       <p>Networking is not about going to networking events and making and sealing deals. It isn’t either about telling as many people as possible about ourselves or our business and handing out loads of business cards. It’s also not something we do once or twice and then give up on if we don’t get new clients. In fact, its primary objective isn’t even to get more clients. That may surprise many people.</p> 
       <p>Networking is first and foremost about making connections and building relationships with people - the more targeted to our work and high quality the better. It’s about staying connected to these people over the long term, developing a mutually supportive relationship where we can get to grow, like, and trust one another. What happens, as we authentically engage in getting to know, like, and trust these people and they us, is that we begin to build our personal brand, our profile, and our reputation.</p> 
       <p>No amount of money can buy those three things. We have to earn them and networking is one of the most effective ways of doing that. Only then will we be ready to do business together, refer clients to one another, and work on joint projects together. Networking is as much about what we can give as what we can get.</p> 
       <p>Building a network of people who believe what we believe and whom we nurture and support is invaluable to our professional lives, our careers, and our businesses. The tangible and intangible ‘wealth’ in such a network is invaluable. That’s why I say: Our network is our net-worth.</p> 
       <p>These are the people who will help us grow our business and our careers. There is a lot of truth in the adage that it’s not what we know that is most important, but who we know.</p> 
       <p class="can">The people in our network can open doors for us. They can: </p> 
       <ul class="text"> 
        <li>Introduce us to people we don’t know who can advance our careers;</li> 
        <li>Connect us to people who under normal circumstances would not take our calls;</li> 
        <li>Provide business opportunities we would otherwise not get access to;</li> 
        <li>Talk about us to people who may be interested in joint venture work;</li> 
        <li>Recommend us for those ideal jobs we didn’t even know were in the offering;</li> 
        <li>Offer professional or business advice;</li> 
        <li>Provide support through a crisis; and</li> 
        <li>Advise on how to handle a difficult client interaction or business deal.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>Building these types of connections and relationships require well-developed interpersonal, communication, and people skills - what are now called soft skills. It is the fact that many professionals have spent much more time developing their technical skills and not paid enough attention to these soft skills that see so many anxious and fearful of networking. They therefore miss out on an exceptional opportunity to enhance their professional lives and build their professional brand and reputation.</p>
