Typically, between one-third and one-half of the courses you&#8217;ll take in college will be in your major or related to it.</p\>\\n\\n<p\>At some colleges, you can even:</p\>\\n\\n<ul\>\\n<li\>Major in two fields.</li\>\\n\\n<li\>Have a major and a minor (a specialization that requires fewer courses than a major).</li\>\\n\\n<li\>Create your own major.</li\>\\n</ul\>\\n\\n<h3\>When to Choose a Major</h3\>\\n\\n<p\>At most four-year colleges, and in the case of many majors, you won&#8217;t have to pick a major until the end of your sophomore year. This gives you plenty of time to check out various subjects and see which ones interest you. Some majors &#8212; like areas of engineering &#8212; are exceptions to this rule. You have to commit to these fields of study early so you have time to take all the required courses.</p\>\\n\\n<p\>If you\'re earning a two-year degree, you\'ll probably select a major at the start because the program is much shorter.</p\>\\n\\n<h3\>How to Choose a Major</h3\>\\n\\n<p\>Take courses in areas that appeal to you, and then think about which subject truly motivates you. Stephanie Balmer, dean of admissions at Dickinson College, suggests you take &#8220;classes in which you&#8217;re going to be confident, but at the same time, take some risks.&#8221; She notes that a class you never planned to take could end up helping you choose your major.</p\>\\n\\n<h3\>You Can Change Your Mind</h3\>\\n\\n<p\>If you&#8217;re not sure about your college major while you&#8217;re in high school, don&#8217;t worry. Most students switch their major during college. Even students who think they are sure about what they want to major in often change their mind.</p\>\\n\\n<p\>Shawna, a college sophomore, began college as a physics major but switched to electrical engineering. During her first semester, she discovered that college physics &#8220;was all the things about my physics class in high school that I didn&#8217;t like. And my engineering class was all the stuff I actually did like.&#8221;</p\>\\n\\n<h3\>Majors and Graduate School</h3\>\\n\\n<p\>Some colleges offer advising programs &#8212; such as premed or prelaw &#8212; to students who plan on attending medical school, law school or graduate school. These programs are not the same as majors; you still need to pick a major.</p\>\\n\\n<p\>College students who are planning to continue their education in professional or graduate programs often choose a major related to their future field. For example, undergraduates in premed programs often major in biology or chemistry. They don&#8217;t have to, though &#8212; as long as students fulfill the course requirements of the graduate program they want to enter, they can major in any subject they like.</p\>\\n\\n<h3\>Majors and Professions</h3\>\\n\\n<p\>If you specialize in something like nursing, accounting or engineering, you\'re learning a specific trade. Many majors, however, prepare you to enter a range of careers once you graduate. For many students, picking a college major is not the same as choosing a job. It will be up to you to pick a career path you like. For example, a degree in English literature might lead you to a job in publishing, teaching, advertising, public relations or law, among other fields.</p\>\\n\\n<p\>Remember, you\'re not alone when choosing a major. Ask academic and peer advisers for help.</p\>\",\"\",\" \",\"<p\>Most students switch their major during college.</p\>\",\"The College Major: What It Is and How to Choose One\",\"java.util.ArrayList/4159755760\",\"java.lang.Integer/3438268394\",\"https://www.collegeboard.org/proxy/autocomplete\",\"org.collegeboard.pacollegeplan.shared.dto.content.BreadCrumbDto/907070322\",\"Home\",\"/\",\"Explore Careers\",\"/explore-careers\",\"College Majors\",\"/explore-careers/college-majors\",\"/explore-careers/college-majors/the-college-major-what-it-is-and-how-to-choose-one\",\"java.util.HashMap/1797211028\",\"org.collegeboard.pacollegeplan.shared.dto.content.ExternalIdKey/1798413972\",\"myOrganizer\",\"org.collegeboard.pacollegeplan.shared.dto.content.common.PageTypeEnum/3717187543\",\"java.lang.String/2004016611\",\"/my-organizer\",\"collegeFinder\",\"/college-search\",\"seoCollegesByStates\",\"/college-search/state\",\"actionPlan\",\"/make-a-plan\",\"collegeProfile\",\"/college-profile\",\"seoCollegesByMajors\",\"/college-search/major\",\"http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/\",\"key=AIzaSyCILlyaRGg9EG0yWExy_KWlRkSDNFCudJ8\",\"A major is a specific subject area that college students specialize in.
