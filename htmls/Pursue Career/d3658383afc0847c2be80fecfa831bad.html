I wouldn’t be extended an offer from Apple after completing a summer internship there. I was told my team suffered severe budget cuts, and couldn’t afford to hire a new grad. I was devastated, as the vision I had of my future was shattered, and all of my hard work, even with recommendations from my mentor and manager, didn’t bring an offer to fruition. I had already mapped out which neighborhood I was going to live in, who I wanted to live with, and which bus route I’d take to work. I didn’t prepare for the scenario in which I wouldn’t get the job, because I was so confident I would.</p>

           <p name="e0b3" id="e0b3" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">October 2015 is when I found out I was at the time jobless after graduation, which is two months into tech recruitment at UC Berkeley, my alma mater. A number of my peers had already found out about their return offers, while I was patiently waiting to hear back about mine. Never did it occur to me that I should apply to other companies just in case; I was very happy with my team at Apple and my position as an Engineering Project Manager. This was a mistake with a domino effect — one that led to many others.</p>
           <p name="04d0" id="04d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Mistake #1: I was completely unprepared for the technical interview process.</strong></p>
           <p name="6297" id="6297" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Learning Lesson #1: The last time I had interviewed for my internship was a year prior, in the fall of 2014. Initially I started off just jobless, but being unprepared for interviews put me in a worse state — jobless and unhappy. October 2015, when I was starting the job hunt, was also in the middle of midterm season. As much as I wanted to prepare for job interviews, I was struggling just to balance my heavy technical courses.</p>
           <p name="02c5" id="02c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Mistake #2: Because of Mistake #1, I felt like I had no other choice but to throw myself into interviews.</strong></p>
           <p name="35b4" id="35b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Learning Lesson #2: I didn’t know how to tackle interview problems, which led to a number of unsuccessful interviews, with only a handful of successful ones. Because of my course load demand, starting from the drawing board with interview preparation didn’t seem like a wise use of time. I quickly learned that ease with getting interviews did not mean that the actual interview would go by with ease. It was a bad idea to go into interviews unprepared, because it took a hit on my self-esteem.</p>
           <p name="02e0" id="02e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Mistake #3: I mistook my failures in interviewing as my failure as a Software Engineer.</strong></p>
           <p name="6de5" id="6de5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Learning Lesson #3: Often, I wondered: “Was I really meant for this career path, if I couldn’t pass most of the interviews I was going through?” (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I spoke more about this in </em><a href="https://medium.com/@akhilaraju/how-my-disability-helped-me-thrive-at-uc-berkeley-computer-science-9a74f2ce309b#.1vhlwim28" data-href="https://medium.com/@akhilaraju/how-my-disability-helped-me-thrive-at-uc-berkeley-computer-science-9a74f2ce309b#.1vhlwim28" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">my previous medium post</em></a>). The technical interviewing process is flawed — it measures how quickly and accurately you can solve problems similar to those from Cracking the Coding Interview, not how well you actually perform as a software engineer. I wrongfully assumed I was failing the interviews because I wasn’t smart enough to do the job. In reality, I was just unprepared. It was too stressful to handle the heavy demands of my coursework, my extracurriculars, and recruiting full-time. When a lot of tech companies have recruiting rounds of an average of 5 technical interviews, it takes a lot out of your schedule and your emotional energy.</p>
           <p name="f2b7" id="f2b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Mistake #4: Out of desperation, I almost took an offer I didn’t really want.</strong></p>
           <p name="9870" id="9870" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Learning Lesson #4: I successfully went through the recruiting process for a few companies. I realized that these companies weren’t a good fit for both my career goals and my personal goals. I contemplated sparing my personal goals for the sake of security in having a job after graduation. After much soul searching, I decided that my personal goals were equally important to my career goals, and that I would only take a job if it satisfied both.</p>
           <h3 name="84dd" id="84dd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p graf--trailing">Failure does not mean you are unqualified for the role you rightfully deserve. Often, we are pushed to get a job immediately after college, putting ourselves under immense pressure to get a job, when one of the biggest pressures to get one is because it’s what is socially expected of&nbsp;us.</h3>

           <p name="d9cf" id="d9cf" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">During my winter break, I spent a lot of time questioning whether engineering was the right path for me. I knew I was passionate about Computer Science, and that one of the major roadblocks to success in interviews was my lack of preparation. I never had software engineering internships and I never truly considered it as a career path. I wanted to be a Project Manager because I felt like my skills and personality suited it more, but also partly because I always questioned whether I was really qualified to be a software engineer.</p>
           <p name="3f39" id="3f39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Without a doubt, I felt like I was lagging behind my peers whenever they would discuss their offers from Company X, Y, and Z and why they chose Company A over Company B. Most of my friends knew what they were doing after graduation. I felt embarrassed because I didn’t. The social pressure consumed me; but once I realized that was all it was — social pressure — I was able to take a step back and see being jobless as a beacon of opportunity. I decided my mental energy was better spent focusing on graduating, and then looking for a job after. I could find a job that really fit my personal goals and my career goals, without the emotional pressure and the time pressure of simultaneously taking classes.</p>
           <h3 name="2ee0" id="2ee0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p graf--trailing">I strongly encourage you to take extra time to search for the job you really want, instead of settling for something that is convenient or that you are unsure about. You have your whole life to work on your career; taking some time off after graduation will not set you back. It will make you stronger. Ultimately, my setbacks allowed me to face my fear of failure and my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" class="markup--anchor markup--h3-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">impostor syndrome</a> head&nbsp;on.</h3>

I graduated from a top school in Computer Science and had a few name-brand internships on my resume, which gave me more flexibility in the options I would have in my job search. * * *</em></p>
           <p name="4634" id="4634" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Benefit #1: Postponing the job search allowed me to more thoroughly enjoy my classes and find balance in my mental and physical health.</strong></p>
           <p name="cb43" id="cb43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was able to fully focus on finishing my degree, and enjoy my technical classes more freely without having the looming stress of interviewing on my mind. The time I had previously spent on interviewing and the anxiety that came from it, I transferred to maintaining a fit lifestyle and focusing on my mental health, which are central to my happiness.</p>
           <p name="6c4d" id="6c4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Benefit #2: Focusing on the job search full-time, after graduation, gave me the flexibility and the time I needed to find the job I wanted.</strong></p>
           <p name="1cdc" id="1cdc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I set my own pace and study schedule, spreading it out to a month of preparation. Having ample time to study removed almost all of the anxiety of the job hunt that I previously had away. I was able to spread out my interviews, which gave me time to look back at what I had been asked and review feedback when given.</p>
           <p name="9939" id="9939" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was able to research dozens of companies and be more selective of which ones I interviewed with. Before, the only way I would look for a job was through my alma mater’s career fairs, which were unreliable in receiving many interviews. I was able to find out about and utilize more tools and resources such as Angel List and Hired.</p>
           <p name="4ab6" id="4ab6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I focused on finding a company that had what was important for my career and personal growth — strong engineering, mentorship, feedback, opportunities to work abroad, and a commitment to diversity and inclusion.</p>
           <p name="476c" id="476c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The plus side of my engineering friends starting work earlier than me was that they could tell me about their experiences at their respective companies, and they could even refer me for a position!</p>
           <p name="6123" id="6123" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Benefit #3: Taking time off allowed me to pursue career interests.</strong></p>
           <p name="838b" id="838b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I graduated in August 2016 (Summer), and spent the Fall semester doing research. I had an interest in Virtual Reality, but had no prior experience in it. While I was going through the interview process, I did research part-time in Virtual Reality, and learned how to use Unity3D and explore new modes of interactivity — I was able to develop a new skill, see whether I was interested in pursuing VR as a career, and also develop professionally — my projects were presented at Stanford and UC Berkeley.</p>
           <p name="3e28" id="3e28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I developed an excellent working relationship with the Professor I was doing research for, which allowed me to realize the qualities in him which I admired and would like future managers and mentors to emulate — open-mindedness, the ability to give constructive criticism, approachability, and most importantly, never-ending curiosity.</p>

           <p name="39a2" id="39a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In the fall semester after I graduated, I lived in International House, which is a dorm with hundreds of international students on exchange at UC Berkeley. From living there, I fostered friendships with people from around the world, and learned the commonalities and differences across languages, cultures, values, and traditions. I really cherish my time there because I developed more empathy and it deepened my interest in travel and working abroad. I was also able to appreciate Berkeley, the Bay Area, and the US from a fresh perspective, through the eyes of people who were really excited to be there and take advantage of every opportunity to travel and learn available to them in their short time there, which was really exhilarating!</p>
           <p name="7737" id="7737" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had every intention of staying in the Bay Area for my first job, since I have a strong network there, including many of my best friends and mentors. However, life in the Bay Area became boring and predictable; I strongly felt like I wouldn’t be able to personally grow there anymore. I had a thirst for something new, exciting, a little (or a lot) less known — which is why I made an impromptu decision to work for Google in NYC!</p>

I traveled to Hong Kong, Beijing, and Xi’an in China with my parents — where I was able to immerse myself in the richness of Chinese history and see the tomb of the Terracotta Warriors, the Great Wall, and the Forbidden City.</p>
           <p name="f10e" id="f10e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During the winter, I did a five-week long tech fellowship in Tel Aviv, Israel. It had been a dream of mine to work there for years, so the fellowship provided the perfect opportunity to scope out the startup and tech scene, build a network, and evaluate whether I really wanted to live there (it was my first time there). I loved Tel Aviv, and am planning on working there as soon as the opportunity arises!</p>

Spending so much time traveling abroad allowed me to reflect on my childhood and college, as well as make new friends and reconnect with old ones. This was by far the most valuable experience I’ve had post-grad because it allowed me to move on from my past and focus on my present and future.</p>

I wouldn’t have had the experiences and learning opportunities I was able to have, in research, in travel, in friendship, amongst several others. I would have stayed in the Bay Area, rather than venture abroad. If it weren’t for that rejection, I would have missed out on valuable personal growth. Through struggle, I became stronger.</p>

I wrongfully assumed I was failing the interviews because I wasn’t smart enough to do the job. In reality, I was just unprepared. It was too stressful to handle the heavy demands of my coursework, my extracurriculars, and recruiting full-time.

I realized that these companies weren’t a good fit for both my career goals and my personal goals. I contemplated sparing my personal goals for the sake of security in having a job after graduation.

Often, we are pushed to get a job immediately after college, putting ourselves under immense pressure to get a job, when one of the biggest pressures to get one is because it’s what is socially expected of us.","markups":[]},{"name":"d9cf","type":1,"text":"During my winter break, I spent a lot of time questioning whether engineering was the right path for me. I knew I was passionate about Computer Science, and that one of the major roadblocks to success in interviews was my lack of preparation.

The social pressure consumed me; but once I realized that was all it was — social pressure — I was able to take a step back and see being jobless as a beacon of opportunity.
