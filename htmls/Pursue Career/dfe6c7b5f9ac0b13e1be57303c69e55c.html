      <h3 class="center">The secret to find your Dream Job</h3> 
      <p>Isn’t it interesting that when we’re in college we have these amazing dreams about what our first job will be?</p> 
      <p>Then we graduate...and take a job doing grunt work while getting paid a quarter of what we thought we deserved.</p> 
      <p>Reality smacks us right in the face — we hate our job, we feel the energy drained out of us every day, and we come home and just want to sit on the couch and watch TV.</p> 
      <p>Days go by, months go by, even YEARS go by and we’re still stuck.</p> 
      <p>Maybe we get a raise here or there, or move to another company — but the moves are usually lateral and the raises don’t add up to much.</p> 
      <p>In the back of our mind, we wonder if there’s something better out there.</p> 
      <p>If this sounds familiar, read on. I want to share with you how I cracked the code for <em>actually</em> finding a job we love — and show you how you can do it too.</p>

      <h3 class="center t-margin">The game being played around us</h3> 
      <p>I know how tough it can be to find our Dream Job.</p> 
      <p>We wonder…</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>When we’ll catch our lucky break</li> 
       <li>Why everyone else but us always gets the best jobs</li> 
       <li>How many more emails we have to send before a hiring manager finally notices us</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>It’s time-consuming, soul-crushing work.</p> 
      <p>While attending Stanford, I got sick of the standard job advice (that never seemed to actually work). Things like…</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Adjusting the font on our resumes</li> 
       <li>“Shotgunning” applications out to dozens of companies (only to never hear back)</li> 
       <li>Applying to jobs we didn’t even really want just because we were told experience is important</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>So my friends and I decided to learn how to “beat” the process.</p> 
      <p>We applied to some of the best companies in the world — McKinsey, Google, Intuit, and more — and dug into our results. What do hiring managers really care about on an application? What body language “ticks” automatically disqualify you in an interview? How do you negotiate a $10,000 raise?</p> 
      <p>We ran a fine-toothed comb through EVERYTHING.</p> 
      <p>It worked — the job offers started pouring in. McKinsey. Bain. Google. Intuit. Multi-billion dollar hedge funds.</p> 
      <h3 class="center t-margin">My $12,000 event — with 100% satisfaction</h3> 
      <p>I took all these lessons we learned back at Stanford — the secrets it took me YEARS to master — and scrutinized them, reworked them, and distilled them down.</p> 
      <p>Then I hosted an exclusive, application-only, 2-day live event to help other people find their Dream Job. I wanted to test these secrets with people of different races. Of different genders. Of different levels of experience. From different industries.</p> 
      <p>The result? There was a 100% satisfaction rate. And the event cost $12,000 per person.</p>

       <p><em>“There’s so much that goes into the job hunting process outside of being good at what you do… I always used to be very intimidated by any kind of application process and I really wanted to correct that. I knew this program would help me.”</em></p> 
       <p><strong>— Logan</strong></p> 
      </div> 
      <div class="indent-left quote testimonial"> 
       <p><em>“It was important to learn negotiation tactics and all these sorts of things in order to find really powerful ways of selling myself...these are skills that you can use for the rest of your life.”</em></p>

      <div class="indent-left quote testimonial"> 
       <p><em>“I’ve been absolutely shocked. I’ve reached out to people who I saw, meet once a conference or just once here or there, and they’ve been super, super helpful...I didn’t realize I had that kind of people in my network.”</em></p> 
       <p><strong>— K.T.</strong></p> 
      </div> 
      <p>After reviewing hours of video and transcripts from this event, I realized it could be even more powerful. So I broke it down and revamped it. My team and I restructured, reorganized, and recategorized the material — all to make it easier for you to absorb, master, and use right away.</p> 
      <p>The result? My Find Your Dream Job course.</p>
