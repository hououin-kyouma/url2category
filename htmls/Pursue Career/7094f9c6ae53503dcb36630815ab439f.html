You may find that you are in the right profession and right organization but wrong job. Or you may discover that you can negotiate with your manager and have more of what you like to do in your current job &#x2013; using your natural talents and interests.

         <td height="913" valign="top" bordercolor="#00BFE1" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="text"><span class="style45">Be True to Yourself</span><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&#x2019;ve defined the seven variables that comprise the inner circle (YOU) of our work lives as well as the four variables that comprise the outer circle (ENVIRONMENT). Our research shows that our personality and interests CHANGE VERY LITTLE IN OUR LIVES. It&#x2019;s though we are hard-wired. Our values change slowly, and mostly in terms of priorities. So it&#x2019;s critical that we understand ourselves well and appreciate our uniqueness. Our personality traits and interests are very difficult to change. On the other hand, learning and enhancing professional skills, business skills, team skills, and leadership skills is possible daily.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, we frequently are unhappy and de-energized because we don&#x2019;t have the right interests, values or personality traits for the job or organization. When choosing, we need to take all these variables into account, especially the ones that are hardest to change. We frequently &#x201c;take the job&#x201d; because we have the right skills and experience, not necessarily the personality, interests or values alignment.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being yourself is only possible when you choose environments (positions, organizations, industries and professions) that respect and value your uniqueness. Work to see that your interests, values and style are in sync with your choices. Put together feedback and learning plans to assure that you develop the competencies and skills required for the work you&#x2019;ve chosen. Maximize your energy to achieve performance success by assuring a strong &#x201c;career fit.&#x201d; <br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find your strength - quick wit, heartfelt compassion, thoughtful questioning, business sense, opportunity seeking, historical awareness, or ability to draw. Build on them. Look for opportunities to use these natural talents in work. Expand your strength. Seek the environment that nurture and reinforce those strengths. You will become stronger and stronger, feel energized and peak performance will come naturally. <br> <br></td>

         <td colspan="3" valign="top"><span class="style48"><strong>Introduction</strong></span><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As employers ramp up their search for talent and raise the performance bar, individuals need to be more choiceful about their work. You continue to change. Organizations change. The job or organization you originally chose may no longer suit you. High performance and lower stress rest on knowing yourself well and choosing work environments that fit you. <br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A great <strong>career fit</strong> is like finding the perfect pair of shoes. They &#x201c;fit&#x201d; <strong>YOU</strong> &#x2013; length, width, arches, support, material, etc. They fit the <strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong> you&#x2019;ve chosen them for &#x2013; running, dancing, climbing, walking, hiking, etc. When you have the right shoes, your energy, enjoyment and performance increase. You can run, climb, dance, play tennis, walk, or hike with great ease and enthusiasm. So, how does this metaphor apply to one&#x2019;s career and performance?<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each person is unique in the universe. We have a unique identity &#x2013; evident in our finger print, our retina scan and DNA code. This uniqueness is not only physical but also psychological. Each person is pre-patterned in certain ways. There are special activities and settings where you feel comfortable. Others where you feel uneasy. The more clearly you can appreciate and articulate your uniqueness -know yourself - the more wisely you can make smart career choices. You will choose environments (organizations, jobs/projects, professions/trades, and industries) where you can BE YOURSELF and perform well. The MasteryWorks CareerFit&#x2122; model helps you assess yourself and make educated career choices.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thousands of participants in our workshops have learned to use this model to reassess existing work or choose other career options. They have agreed that when there is a poor &#x201c;fit&#x201d;, as described in this paper, they feel depressed, lack energy and have to work harder to perform adequately or above what&#x2019;s expected. When they feel like they &#x201c;fit&#x201d; the work they&#x2019;re doing, they feel energized, productive, and fulfilled. They&#x2019;re in the <em>flow</em>.<br> <br><strong></strong></td>

We find this to be a helpful categorization of activities and have created an assessment instrument with 52 activities, organized into the four categories. Using the deck of cards or on-line version, individuals can determine which of the four interest categories contain activities they enjoy. (See <strong><a href="../assessments/assess_tsort.htm" target="_top">TALENTSORT® Interest Cards Assessment </a></strong>)<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals frequently get a strong &#x201c;ahah&#x201d; when they see that they may be spending the predominant amount of their time working in activities that really don&#x2019;t interest or attract them. Individuals who like working with facts and figures (Data) might be spending most of their time with working with People. Or, individuals who love working with their hands (Things) spend their time supervising people or in administrative tasks. This lack of &#x201c;fit&#x201d; becomes an energy drain. Individuals can change jobs or negotiate tasks in their existing jobs to better fit their natural interests. This shift can result in higher productivity and less stress.

They&#x2019;ve evolved to take care of the twelve basic needs. Historically, people in the community or tribe emerged and were mentored to take care of these basic needs &#x2013; health, shelter, security, learning, family, leisure, etc. People spotted and groomed young people who would learn their craft. Today, we&#x2019;ve separated learning from working, so the natural mentoring and development in the professions and trades that occurred historically is often left in the hands of people detached from the work itself. (This is more true in the professions than the trades!) Frequently teachers have little or no relationship with their students, with little chance to observe their natural propensities for many trades or professions. Consequently, the focus of much of education is to prepare young people to &#x201c;get a job&#x201d; more than &#x201c;find a profession or trade &#x2013; a vocation&#x201d; &#x2013; that suits the individual and takes care of the community. <br> <br> <em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professions</strong></em> or <em><strong>Trades</strong></em> are <em><strong>recognized areas of expertise that are enduring and substantial. They are broad areas or disciplines that have recognized leaders, educational programs or apprenticeships, professional associations, and publications</strong></em>. It takes ten to seventeen years to master any profession or trade. There are a distinct set of competencies and skills required for mastery of any profession or trade. This is what distinguishes one profession or trade from another &#x2013; the core practices.<br> <br> <strong>Examples of Professions/Trades:</strong></td>
