                Often they’ve spent time looking at job opportunities online and thinking how depressing it is! or they’ve recently had the realization that “this can’t be all there is” to work. You might have even already taken assessments, personality tests and quizzes only to find out that you’re still in the same place

                Recently I spoke on the phone with an HTYC’er named Matt,&nbsp;he told me “I’m looking for a career, not just a job!”
               </div> 
               <div>
                &nbsp;
               </div> 
               <div>
                He said he felt like he was just wasting his time doing what he was doing right now!
               </div> 
               <div>
                &nbsp;

               <div>
                Here’s the thing!

                My parents didn’t teach me this, When I went to College it was their job to help me select a major NOT to help me figure out what I was truly amazing at.
               </div> 
               <div>
                &nbsp;
               </div> 
               <div>
                This led me to take a job that I fell into.
               </div> 
               <div>
                &nbsp;
               </div> 
               <div>
                I knew it wasn’t the perfect thing for me, but I took it because that’s what everyone told me I should do! That it was a good job and I should be thankful that the opportunity was there.
               </div> 
               <div>

                So I did and I spent the next 12 months trying to convince myself that this was just what work was like. It had to suck and the goal of life was to tolerate it so you could do what you really wanted on the weekends.

                I finally had enough after freaking out with anxiety on the way to the office on my 2 hour per day commute and told my boss I thought I made a mistake taking the job.

               <div>
                &nbsp;
               </div> 
               <div>
                He apparently thought he had made a mistake too because 3 weeks later he fired me.

                <p>I signed up for this because I am looking to go back to work after an almost 17 year break (!) to raise my family. With 3 kids on the brink of college, I’d like to help support my family financially. I am trying to figure out what type of job/career to pursue – previous jobs were computer networking consultant and then application development manager. I like technology, but feel like most everything has changed in my absence. I never felt like “I love this job!” so, should I return to something similar, where I may start out earning a decent wage, or should I try something new, where I may have to start at an entry level position? If something new, what in the world should it be??? And who’s looking for a 50 year old to fill an entry level position?? This is where I’m stuck. Perhaps I could use some of my “transferable skills” (e.g., project management, problem solving, etc) in a new area that really interests me? I have been creating excuses for not going back to work (who will drive kids to activities, doctor appts, grocery shop, cook dinner, clean the house, take care of the yard, plan vacations, and the list goes on and on), but now am in a rut because I’m no longer adding much value at home – rather, I continue to do things for my kids that they should be doing themselves because it makes me feel useful, helpful and of some value. Really, I am doing them a disservice. </p> 
                <p>So … I guess I’m looking for something to help me identify where I will be most successful (strengths) and most interested (passion/interests). Stumbled upon HTYC yesterday, and decided to give it a try.</p>

                <p>hello! i signed up as, i am not happy with my present job. i feel it to be a routine kind of copy paste job which i don’t ever wanted to do. i always wanted to do something interesting and which requires more hard work, talent and which gives scope of learning ever.</p>

                <p>hi scott! i signed up because i’m 24 and my current job is not exciting or fulfilling. i’m good at it, but don’t have any drive to do a good job because i don’t think it matters and i’m not passionate about the company or the product. i’m young and want to jump headfirst into a career that i can get behind as early as possible. i’m at a crossroads in my life and i know that i need to start doing things to make a difference for myself.</p>

                <p>My one golden rule has always been to do what you love and never work a day in your life but make work part of every day life.<br> I still feel this way, however for the past 3 years (since we moved and I try to pursue a ‘lifestyle entrepreneur’ career), I have felt that I am stagnating a bit, and not moving forward anymore because I am not sure in which direction…<br> When I ask myself, ‘but what is it what you really want to do’ or ‘how can I change/improve what I am doing now’ – I find myself with loss of words… I can say what I “like” to do… but when it comes down to strengths and passions I am not 100% sure I have the clearly defined yet. So I am interested to see what these 8 days may teach me.</p>

                <p>I signed up because it was free and short, and because my life has finally started to quiet down so it’s a good time for this. </p> 
                <p>I had previously signed up for two other courses (approx cost ~$2000) but, like I thought they would, they are still waiting to be completed and adding to my overwhelming email inbox and to-do list.</p> 
                <p>I’m supposed to be a Registered Dietitian. I put in a lot to get there: graduated with distinction and hundreds of hours of volunteer work, $25K in student loans, completed a very competitive, grueling 9-month unpaid internship (waitressed on weekends to get by = worked every day of the week), applied to 40 jobs and did 7 interviews before getting my first job 6 months after graduating. That first term position totally shattered my life, self-esteem and self-confidence. So, it was awful to say the least. I’ve strongly questioned whether RD is right for me, but I hope to not let one bad experience determine my career so I’ve been trying to find something else in a different area of my field to try out. I’ve been out of the field for 1 year now. Burnt out and defeated. My employment insurance ran out 4 months ago so I picked up whatever I could find. April-May, I was working 3 jobs, running two little direct-sales businesses and looking after my injured-at-work boyfriend who could not contribute to any housework. June has been trying to catch my breath (and we moved!), and July, I finally have some white space on my calendar and I’m hoping to start chipping away at the giant to-do pile that grew these last three months. </p> 
                <p>I know, I know, “there’s no time for anything, we have to make time.” Now is just a better time though.</p>

                <p>I signed up because I have been trying to figure out what I want to do with my life for the past several years! I’ve been in the service industry for almost 10 years now and I just can’t do it anymore. I need a job with more purpose than making sure that I don’t get a bad Yelp review because a guest doesn’t understand why we can’t split checks (and yes this actually happened.) I’ll spare you the gory details of the endless hours of stories I’m sure anyone who has worked as a server could relate to. This series just so happened to pop up in my email as I was about to go to sleep, and I just thought, wow, this was meant to be! I’m looking forward to the series. Thanks for being a light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel! </p>

                <p>I singed up because I have injuries and need to make a career change. I am no longer able to stand a lot. I have an idea of what I would like to do, but it also requires a lot of standing. I have had some people tell me not to let that stop me. I want to go to a school and learn to make prosthetic s. I want to find a career that I can do and also feel good about doing. Personally I think being a secretary would be kind of boring but I am not sure I have too many other options.</p>

                <p>Hi Scott! I signed up because I am starting my 15th year in my current career that I feel I have been very successful in but am wondering if this is what I want to continue to do for the next 15. I have been fortunate to have been a part of very meaningful work but it has left me with little energy for me to show up with when I am with my family; the ones who are most important to me. I am also loosing interest in my current field and have been progressively over the last 5 years. I am hoping this can offer some clarity of what I really want and to find a job that can go to work for me and my family in hopes that I can feel my like I’m thriving and not just surviving. </p>

                <p>Tricia, I totally understand, part of the reason for my most recent “career change” (this business) was because I wanted to be able to 1) Help people in the way I’m best at 2) I wanted to be able to be at home with my wife and kids and 3) I wanted to be able to work in the ways that work best for me AND create really useful things that people appreciate. </p> 
                <p>I wanted to be able to “do life” in a way that allows me to show the best sides for all the important people to me. </p>

                <p>Wow! Tricia and I must be following the same career path because I am feeling almost exactly the same after being in the same career for 16 years now. Although it’s evolved over the years, and I recently took it a step further by venturing into management, I’m still uncertain whether this is really what I want to do for the remainder of my working days. Thankfully, I’ve had the opportunity to work with a boss who is more like a teammate and friend than a supervisor for much of the past 16 years, so that’s made it more bearable for me to stick with it.<br> Hoping this mini-course will help me do a little soul searching so I can determine what will ultimately fulfill me. </p>

                <p>Hi Scott, I joined because after working twenty odd years in the advertising industry I need to find something with more substance and meaning. In my 40s and with two kids I am realizing that I’ve never really decided what I wanted to do with my life. I am constantly being pulled in different directions and seem have become paralyzed by my lack of focus. In addition, advertising will soon be done with me as age and experience are not traits the industry covets. </p>

                <p>If you signed up for other courses and they are waiting you don’t have a knowledge problem, you have an accountability problem (which that’s me too!) instead for you I would suggest coaching or a class that has a cohort and you have to attend or something else that will cause you to feel a little uncomfortable if you don’t do the work to put yourself in a good position.</p>

                <p>I heard you on Mac Pritchard’s “How to Find Your Dream Job” podcast &amp; just signed up for the 8-day mini course you mentioned! I was laid off at the end of December after almost 24 years. At first, I saw it as a great opportunity to create a fresh, new career (and deep down I still do), but it’s been 8 months &amp; I still feel LOST! At this point, it’s getting financially challenging, yet I’d still prefer to find the RIGHT job, and not just A job. I hope to get some clarity because I still don’t know what I want to be when I “grow up.” Thanks!</p>

                <p>I am pursuing my Post Graduation in management and I will soon need to select a specialisation(Finance,Marketing,HR or Operations). This decision for me is overwhelming since I’ve already screwed up earlier(Graduated with a finance major and worked in the diamond industry as a diamond appraiser and assorter).Once I make this decision it’ll probably be the last one leaving me with only one career to pursue for life, so it might as well be one that I love working for.</p>

                <p>Hiya, Heard about it on a coaching for leaders podcast last night and thought “this is for me!” I’m in a point of my career where I realise I’ve slid into everything I’ve done and want to be more purposeful in my actions and have my days align more with my life goals in general.</p>

                <p>I feel like I can do so much more, so much better, so much more interesting things with my “work” time. I am in search of that path that will get me excited getting up the bed every morning. I totally can relate to how depressing it is to look at the board job and see your usual sales, accounting, trades. I just don’t seem to be falling into any of these. However I am stuck at what can I do with myself. Hoping this course will help me to shed some light on that or give me some inspiration and ideas.</p>

                <p>This is SO for me – after several years of working different jobs, I decided to go to college at 30 to pursue my Bachelor’s Degree in Criminal Justice. I feel like there’s a reason I did this, since the next couple of positions seemed so fulfilling… to a point. Now I’m 43 and pursuing my Graduate Degree in… wait for it… English and Creative Writing! Wow, different right? I’m getting A’s and one B+ and am in the process of induction into the largest honor society in America. Okay, with that said, the direction I’m in, I question every single day. What am I doing? What do I really want to do? Where do I really want to go? (and) What can I do with these degrees when all is said and done? (And at my age??) I’m fit and super young at heart but my age is obviously climbing. I’ll be 44 in February and am in dire need of direction. I’m one of the many personality and career assessment takers and still feel like I have no clue. I’m so looking forward to going in the right direction – wayyyy too many narrow little foot trails that distract me and lead me the wrong way only to get lost. 🙁 Help!</p>

                <p>Hey Benjamin, almost everyone comes to us because they feel the exact same way you do. One thing you will notice in all of our tools, programs, courses and coaching is that we won’t focus on what to do for “the rest of your life” but instead focus on what is most important to you right now and making a “next step decision” because 1) it’s way too much pressure to put on yourself to decide what to do for the rest of your life and you won’t go anywhere with that much pressure on you and 2) you won’t be the same person 5 or 10 years from now and as you go through each season of your life you will decide you want different things than what you did before. </p> 
                <p>That said we can absolutely help, for your particular situation you may want to check out our “figure out what fits” or “career change bootcamp” programs (or “side biz MBA” if you want to do your own thing) since you want help in the process. Just fill out our help form, <a href="http://happentoyourcareer.com/help" rel="nofollow">http://happentoyourcareer.com/help</a> and we can help you decide what may work for you.</p>

                <p>I’m still new to the whole career thing and hadn’t given it enough thought out of college. After almost two years at my current job I find that I enjoy elements of what I do but have long periods of dreading going into work. My husband and I have been praying about it and are looking to redirect my energy to something more life-giving to both of us and that aligns with our long-term goals.</p>

                <p>Hey Emily, I’ve definitely felt that relief too! </p> 
                <p>Now you can do something about it! On that note, this 8 day course will help you get started down the path to figure out what will fit but it won’t help you understand how to avoid the app trap (sending application after application) </p>

                <p>I signed up because after 3.5 years in my current position, at my current company &amp; 7 years in similar roles, in similar companies – I have been feeling…quite frankly…bored. I don’t mean bored in the sense of not having enough tasks &amp; responsibilities to fill my work days; but I rather mean bored in the way that leaves me with the sensation of having spent my office hours sleep walking, or on auto-pilot, mentally disengaged, unchallenged, &amp; stagnant. Then, when I finally brought up the topic for discussion &amp; was questioned by my bosses on the subject of where I saw myself 1,3, or 5 years from now, I had no answer for them. In fact, I realized, from day 1, there had never even been any discussion of options for my development or growth.<br> Not sure how I got there, but very unhappy about being there – now, is a wonderful time, to work myself out.</p>

                <p>I had a hard time picking a major in college because I like so many different things and had no clear vision of what I wanted to do with my life, so I picked what seemed like the most challenging major–chemical engineering. I then made preparations to go to law school and become a patent lawyer, scored well on the LSAT, and then, while applying to law school, didn’t feel right about it anymore. </p> 
                <p>So I went to engineering grad school instead, on the feeling that as a lawyer I would be sidelined from the science, which I thought was what I actually cared about. I started a PhD candidate, but switched to the master’s track, feeling that I missed face-to-face interaction with people too much to be a researcher. So I decided to try pursuing medical school, and took all the requisite supplementary coursework for that. Just one year ago, I graduated with my master’s degree and finished all the med school required courses. Add to this that for the last year, I have been doing call center and translation work (I’m multilingual) because I didn’t plan well enough (or feel motivated enough, frankly) to land a good job coming out of grad school. </p> 
                <p>I am on track to apply for medical school this summer. However, even through all of this, I feel like I haven’t yet achieved the inner clarity that I need to make a good decision about my career path, as bad as that sounds, and I am doing this course in the hope of achieving that clarity or at least coming closer to it. I really do believe that I have a lot to offer the world, and I really, really want to find what it is.</p>

                <p>So, I finally saved enough (I thought it was enough anyway) to go to nursing school. I thought it was THE JOB, I was going to excel and travel the world, while nursing. I quit my job that I was OK at but not very fulfilling Jan 2, 2017 and started a nursing program. April 18th I dropped the program. I was doing fine academically but where I had the most anxiety and fear is when I went to clinicals. I finally had it with the fear and anxiety. Now I’m trying to get back to my old job or maybe find something I’ve always wanted to do. I don’t regret dropping since I had to find out if Nursing was right for me. So, now I’m scared and here I am. <a href="https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/08b916bbe097fdff05a1ae91b1f9f406d30009217b04a059a04ee777a536c482.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/08b916bbe097fdff05a1ae91b1f9f406d30009217b04a059a04ee777a536c482.jpg</a></p>

                <p>I went to college to be a mechanical engineer because my dad really encouraged me to do so. He had worked in the engineering industry and knew that the pay was good and the job provided the type of mental challenge he thought I would need to keep me engaged. My mom is a retired school teacher and from the time I was little, I always thought I would be a kindergarten teacher. I’ve always been attracted to the education industry and the benefits that teachers have. But the perks in engineering that my dad talked about sounded good and part of me really wanted to prove that I could do it and be successful in a male-dominated field. I did graduate with my bachelor’s degree but it took me 6 years instead of 4 to do it. I loved college my freshman year and did really well in all of my classes; however, once I started taking the heavier math, science, and engineering classes, I struggled and I kept second-guessing my major, thinking that maybe it wasn’t the right choice since I was having so much trouble. But I didn’t want to waste my parents’ money, so I kept pushing myself to finish the degree. Once I was out of school, I landed a job at an engineering contracting firm that focused on designing oil and gas refinery units. Over time, that nagging feeling of doubt re-engaged and I became unhappy with my job. I kept dreaming and wishing I had gone into education, but the significant salary difference made me afraid that I wouldn’t be able to make it on such low pay, so I never pursued getting the alternative teacher certification. I’ve also tried to think of other jobs that I might be equipped for, taken multiple personality tests and quizzes, and at times felt like I might be grasping at any straw possible if it meant not being an engineer anymore. I did think it might be the particular employer or the work environment, so I have changed jobs twice: once to another, much-smaller engineering firm, and then to an end-user chemical plant. I did discover that I liked working for a smaller company better, but I absolutely hate working at the plant. I am now at a point where the stress and anxiety overwhelm me daily and I keep thinking I have got to find something that is a better fit before I lose my mind.</p>

                <p>I went to art school for illustration &amp; fine art many years ago. I could not, even with close to ten years of effort make enough as an artist to live reasonably and I shifted into hotel work / tending bar and eventually administrative work to make a living. [I do not enjoy graphic design or making art on a computer, so I kept art as a hobby to preserve my love of it.] I escalated the administrative work into executive assistant work. After doing the best I can for over 9 years and getting to the highest level, I feel like I am stuck. There are no career options / real promotions; the work is drudgery; there are no pay increases; you are forever the wind beneath someone’s wings [yawn]; you are not learning, growing or changing the world in any way. It is soul sucking [for a creative person] to exist in a world of figurative mental rocks stacking according to size and color every single day while chasing grown executives like toddlers. Even at a company where the mission does improve the world the job is the same – details, cat herding, mental rock stacking, acquiescing and basically being an office mommy. This is not fulfilling to me at all and although I bring the best attitude (and gratitude) I can to work daily and have tried everything to “decide to be happy” the role is really the polar opposite of what I want my life to represent. I am looking for a practical direction that a) makes adequate money and b) is somewhat meaningful / resonates with my primary skills. I think I will likely find a lead in this course, or I hope to. Thanks!</p>

                <p>I work in a field I’m passionate about, but I simply can’t get the security, earning and chance to do really in depth work, development and learning I crave. I work with small ethical businesses but the market where I am in the UK just isn’t there. Freelancing is tough, I’m 38 and some day I want to have kids and tell them what I’ve achieved, learned from and offered with pride. Though it’s been amazing at times I’m not quite there and I’m definitely not going to be able to send them to university! Respect to scott and all on this channel.

                <p>I’ve worked for the same organization for almost 20 years, and generally my work has been secondary to the need to support my kids and have the vacation time and flexibility to be available for them. I just got remarried and in a year my youngest daughter will graduate, so I am allowing myself to think of a change as I begin to see transition ahead. However, I am now so fatigued and worn out emotionally and physically that I just can’t keep up the pace, especially with a two hour daily commute and the stark realization that I hate driving. I have gone through multiple career coaches, training programs, yoga certifications and other professional development programs, but nothing really seems to stick. I also feel like I have reached a point where I assume people won’t see my strengths, and so I tend to hide myself and my skills, as I have lost confidence in my abilities and my passions. I am passionate about spirituality – exploring Buddhism and meditation, reading about the mind and psychology, and love writing, thinking, being outside, yoga, walking dogs, poetry and read anything and everything. I would also love to simplify my life – cook healthy and simple meals, drink tea, plant a garden and learn to quiet my mind. None of these interests really seem like career opportunities, although I have completed the rough draft of a novel and sometimes go back to editing that. Its all chaos and confusion in my scattered mind, so I’m hoping this course will help.</p>

                <p>I have been a family nurse practitioner for 20+ years. Loved what I did at first, but changes in healthcare over the past 5-10 years (see more patients, sicker patients, all in less time while documenting more) nearly sucked the life out of me. Less than a year ago, I found a company that creates/staffs onsite employee health centers. They seemed to “get it” and allow providers time to actually listen to their patients so I signed on! Have been in the best job of a my career since early 2017 (75% time in patient care + 5% of time in health education + 20% of time in managing a small team of 5). However, my company lost the contract for this employee health center, and in 2018, I will be forced to go with a new company, lose my management responsibilities, and make less $ OR find something different. I really love managing my team (first time shot at it) and continue to receive positive feedback from supervisors and team members. Additionally, I enjoy becoming proficient at the various electronic medical record platforms I have used, finding ways to improve work-flows, then sharing my tips/tricks w/ co-workers, becoming the resident “IT” person in the office (unpaid, of course!). Just wondering how to hone all of these skills into the PERFECT job with the highest possible salary (our oldest son starting senior year of high school). Ready to learn!</p>

                <p>Hi Amy – I’d love to hear how the program worked for you and what progress you’ve made in the month since you posted this. Your response reads amazingly similarly to my story – 20 years with same company (although a few consulting and entrepreneurial side ventures along the way thrown in) – kids leaving (2 in college, one in HS) – feeling lack of confidence in abilities and chaos in my mind. Also love many of the similar things – reading, my dogs, walking, yoga, …and too….wondering how they can be (if they can be a career). Looking forward to working through this program and learning from others as well</p>

                <p>I have been working in Customer Service in one form or another for at least 15 years. The past 12.5 have been as a Chiropractic Assistant. I speak with insurance companies in regards to problem claims. It is getting worse with some companies to resolve problems as it seems that they are not training the people they hire. I have a natural “fire” that comes out in a plethora of verbiage when I get frustrated or upset because of some of these things. So while I manage to do the tasks at hand, when I come across someone that wants to argue the point with me, the customer so to speak, it is all I can do to keep from climbing through the phone line to them! I also handle the collections piece and it is disheartening to see the same names over and over on my list. I run through the drill, then call, then they pay enough to get me off their back for awhile. When did it become acceptable to not pay your bills? Or that don’t even open their mail and then tell me they didn’t get the three statements and two letters sent and why am I calling them about “collections” and they don’t like my “tone”. I have the “fire” but I want peace. I don’t want to fight anymore to try to get people to understand what their responsibilities are, or to try to have them baffle me with BS! I would like work that brings joy, and peace and where each person handles their responsibilities well and we hold each other accountable with kindness. I agree with Jenny McCreary, it has gotten worse in the last 5-10 years. Much worse!</p>

                <p>So I’ve been in Sales for over 15 years and the targets drove me crazy and I hated it. My last job also left so much to be desired as I felt unappreciated and the values of the company did not align with my values. I had to quit and go for a coaching certification hoping to go into business for myself. Business is not as easy as I thought and I now know I need to get back to work as a bridge to eventually consolidate my coaching business. I’m now back in the job market and I need to make the right choice. I can’t afford to waste any more time doing what I hate</p>
