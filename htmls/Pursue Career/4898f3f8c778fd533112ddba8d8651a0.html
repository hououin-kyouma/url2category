      <p>University is the perfect time to build your skills and experience. Extra-curricular activities can complement and enhance your academic studies, and give you a head start on achieving your future goals.</p> 
     </section> 
     <div id="content_container_2143573"> 
      <p>The two main skill sets that you should aim to develop while studying at university are:</p>
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Professional or technical skills:</strong> specific skills required by your field of interest, acquired through study and related work experience.</li>
       <li><strong>Employability skills:</strong> transferable skills common to all work roles and workplaces, acquired through study and work experience, but also through a range of work and other life experiences.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="assessing">Assessing your employability skills</h2>
      <p>Employability skills are viewed by employers as important for success in the workplace as well as for your future employment opportunities. Examples of employability skills include:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>interpersonal and communication skills (consistently rated as the most important)</li>
       <li>teamwork</li>
       <li>leadership</li>
       <li>problem solving</li>
       <li>planning and organising</li>
       <li>customer service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Consider conducting a <a href="http://careers.unimelb.edu.au/students/planning-my-career/employability">skills audit</a> to assess your employability skills and how you might work on developing them.</p>
      <h2 id="attributes">Skills and attributes</h2>
      <p>Skills are a primary focus when it comes to professional development, but attributes play an equally important role. An attribute is a characteristic or personality trait that enhances and complements your employability skills.</p>

      <p>While you don't necessarily 'build' attributes in the same way that you build employability skills, you need to identify what your best attributes are and where your strengths and weaknesses may be. It is important to identify attributes that may be desirable in relation to your particular industry or job type.</p>
      <h2 id="transfer">Understanding transferable skills</h2>
      <p>Transferable skills are skills that you develop and use throughout your life in work and non-work situations, that can be easily transferred and adapted from one role to another. They allow you to function effectively across different industries, job types and workplaces.</p>
      <p>The following list provides examples of transferable skills, as well as examples of circumstances in which you may have built and developed these skills.</p>

      <p>You possess a wide range of skills that you have developed through your study, work and life experience. It is your job to reflect on your experiences, identify your transferable skills and articulate them when required. Employers or stakeholders may ask you: “what have you done so far?” or “why should we offer this opportunity to you?” You need to be able to articulate why providing you with an opportunity would be a worthwhile investment for them.</p>

         <p>A <a href="http://careers.unimelb.edu.au/students/jobs-and-opportunities/internships-work-experience-and-mentoring/mentoring-programs">mentor</a> can assist you in getting the most out of your study, and to expand your knowledge of future employment pathways and strategies after graduation. You may consider becoming a mentor yourself, which is a great way to demonstrate to employers that you enjoy giving back to the community. Mentoring is an effective way to develop empathy, active listening and rapport-building skills, which are relevant to a range of professional opportunities requiring interpersonal and communication skills.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <span class="accordion__title">Co-curricular and extra-curricular activities</span> 
        <div class="accordion__hidden"> 
         <p>These activities provide great entry-level skill development and networking opportunities, and many of them are on campus. For example, <a href="https://futurestudents.unimelb.edu.au/explore/the-melbourne-model/life_outside_the_classroom">student interest clubs</a> enable you to develop skills such as event organising, project management, teamwork, communication, leadership and more. It is recommended to get involved at the start of your student journey.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <span class="accordion__title">Study abroad</span> 
        <div class="accordion__hidden"> 
         <p>Spending a period of time overseas at a partner institution can be a life-changing experience and provide new insights into your preferences, choices and ideas about your future. Other benefits include cross-cultural communication skills, cultural awareness, establishing new connections, self-management, planning and resourcefulness. These skills all contribute to developing your ability to thrive in today's diverse global market. The University offers a range of options if you are interested in <a href="http://www.mobility.unimelb.edu.au/outbound/study-abroad">study abroad</a>.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <span class="accordion__title">Work experience</span> 
        <div class="accordion__hidden"> 
         <p>You may seek opportunities to develop professional and transferable skills in a setting similar to a work environment, solving real-life business problems individually or in teams. Keep yourself informed of opportunities within your industry, such as employer-sponsored competitions or other industry opportunities for student engagement.</p>
         <ul>
          <li><strong>Internships:</strong> fixed-term work experience programs such as <a href="http://careers.unimelb.edu.au/students/jobs-and-opportunities/internships-work-experience-and-mentoring">internships</a> are a great way to gain insights into a profession or a specific organisation, and assist in developing networks. They also provide an opportunity to demonstrate what you can contribute to the workplace and may lead to an offer of employment.</li>
          <li><strong>Work Integrated Learning (WIL) placements:</strong> you may have the opportunity to consider internship subject placements. These are subjects embedded in your university curriculum and assessment that incorporate work experience and structured reflective practice, which reinforces professional learning. See your <a href="http://about.unimelb.edu.au/governance-and-leadership/faculties">faculty or course adviser</a> for further information.</li>

       <li> <span class="accordion__title">Part-time or casual work</span> 
        <div class="accordion__hidden"> 
         <p>This type of work may include entry-level positions in the workforce that may not require specific qualifications, such as hospitality. Part-time or casual roles are great for developing your understanding of the workplace, as well as transferable skills and attributes such as communication, teamwork, customer service and punctuality. You may also consider professional or semi-professional positions in a temporary or casual capacity. This is a great way to enter a company or profession of your preference.</p>
