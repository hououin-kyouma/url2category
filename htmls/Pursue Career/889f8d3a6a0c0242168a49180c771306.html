        <div data-reactid=".1gle8uj5cj2.1.0.1.0.1">
         <p>Everyone has distinct interests, skills and passions. But when it comes to work, most people are looking for the same general thing: a career that is meaningful, engaging, and (ideally) well-paying. Most of us want a balanced life full of work that brings happiness and prosperity.</p> 
         <p>&nbsp;On this bonus episode of Find Your Dream Job, Chris Guillebeau, author of <a href="http://amzn.to/2qydp7p" rel="nofollow"><b>Born for This</b></a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2pYy4P1" rel="nofollow"><b>The $100 Startup</b></a>, explains the three things that contribute to this sense of balance. To find the job you were born to do, you need to focus on:</p> 
         <ul> 
          <li>Joy: A job that makes you happy</li> 
          <li>Money: A career that is is financially viable</li> 
          <li>Flow: A livelihood that maximizes your unique skills</li> 
         </ul>
