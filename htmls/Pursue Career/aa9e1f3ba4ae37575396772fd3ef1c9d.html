         <p>Because your resume is perhaps the most important document in your job search efforts, there are some points to be considered in making this tool as effective as possible. Be prepared to invest the time required to polish and update your resume.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>All information on your resume must be accurate and up to date. By sending or posting your resume, you are agreeing that all information disclosed is accurate and true.</strong></p> 
         <h4>THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIONS WILL HOPEFULLY ASSIST YOU IN PREPARING YOUR RESUME:</h4> 
         <p><strong>Why have a resume?:</strong>&nbsp;Your resume is your greatest tool in acquiring an interview. Everyone needs a powerful resume to serve 2 main purposes: </p> 
         <ul class="default-list"> 
          <li>To present a snapshot of your skills, abilities, experience, and knowledge.</li> 
          <li>To help you get an interview.</li> 
         </ul> 
         <p><strong>Style</strong><br>The three styles of resumes are chronological, functional and a combination of the two. The chronological resume lists jobs and duties sequentially beginning with the current or most recent position. This style focuses on your growth in a specific profession. The functional resume emphasizes professional skills. The combination of the two styles incorporates the strengths of both the chronological and the functional. Your resume should be short, easy to read, and use words that are familiar to the reader. The goal is to show off your achievements and minimize any weaknesses. </p> 
         <p><strong>Length.</strong><br>You are encouraged to limit your resume to one page. Certainly, there are exceptions. A counselor will be happy to review your resume and help you in this process. </p> 
         <p><strong>Identifying Information.</strong><br>There is no need to put the word "resume" or words "resume of" at the top of the page. This document has become recognizable and will speak for itself. Your name,phone number and e-mail address should be placed at the top of the page. If you choose to list your address and have a school address in addition to another address (parents, etc.), it is advisable to list those addresses where you might be reached. Be sure to update the address or phone number if changes occur. </p> 
         <p><strong>Objective.</strong><br>Ideally, a resume will be specifically prepared for each employer. Because of this, use care in how you word your "career objective." If you are applying for positions in several different areas, the objective may be omitted from your resume. Education majors should replace "career objective" with "teaching field" because this is what they are certified for and it is not likely to change. To target a particular employer or career field, you may want to prepare individual resumes for the actual interview. Remember, cover letters can be used to serve the purpose of establishing why you are sending a resume and you will be the communicator of this information in the interview itself. </p> 
         <p><strong>Education.</strong><br>Included in this section are undergraduate and graduate degrees earned. Most recent degrees are listed first (reverse chronological order). Include your major and minor if applicable. You may promote your marketable skills by putting other areas of academic emphasis; "15 hours computer science," "8 hours technical writing," etc. If space allows, you might even list some course titles. Grade point averages may be given in this section. Some students give their cumulative GPA or choose major GPA or junior/senior GPA, depending on which represents them most favorably.&nbsp;If you are not using the cumulative GPA, then label the GPA to explain it. </p> 
         <p><strong>Experience.</strong><br>This section may include part-time or full-time work. It may also include internships and volunteer experiences. Name, city and state location of the organization, your title or position, and dates worked should be included. Describe your experiences in active, marketable skill-related terms and emphasize accomplishments. </p> 
         <h4>OTHER CATEGORIES:</h4> 
         <p><strong>Extracurricular Activities.</strong><br>This section may be titled many different ways. What you want to emphasize is the name of the organization, leadership roles, accomplishments and dates. Involvement in activities can and should be presented in such a way to show that you can interact with others, motivate, problem-solve, and achieve goals. </p> 
         <p><strong>Languages.</strong><br>State your foreign language skills and accurately indicate your fluency. Foreign studies and/or travel might be appropriately placed here. </p> 
         <p><strong>Study Abroad.</strong><br> Study abroad can be listed in it's own section or in Education.&nbsp; </p> 
         <p><strong>Skills.</strong><br>A skills summary can be a strong section to add, particularly for a generalist or for someone with varied work experience. &nbsp;Focus on objective marketable skills for the field you are targeting. </p> 
         <p><strong>Computer Languages/Literacy.</strong><br>State your language knowledge and&nbsp;level of ability. For example: basic knowledge, conversational, or fluent. </p> 
         <p><strong>Interests.</strong><br>The addition of a section on personal hobbies can provide the interviewer with helpful information. However, you should rarely delete other, more useful information to allow space for this section. </p> 
         <p><strong>Personal.</strong><br>Personal data such as age, sex, weight, and place of birth were, at one time, a standard listing on the resume. Since the passing of equal employment legislation, this material is usually omitted. Unless you believe this is truly beneficial to the job you are seeking, this information is now considered to have little impact on hiring decisions and is generally omitted.Because relocation and willingness to travel are often a requirement for some career opportunities, University Career Center suggests that phrases such as "willing to travel," "willing to relocate" or "seek position in Southwest or Texas" be placed in the near the top of your resume, either in the job objective or in a profile section or in another section of the resume. </p> 
         <p><strong>References.</strong><br>At some point during the hiring procedure you will be asked to furnish references. With few exceptions, your references will be contacted regarding your employability.<br><br>Though you may have written references in your application, we encourage you to list your references on a separate document. Include each reference's name, title, address, phone number and e-mail address. Only list those persons who have given you permission to do so. For those students who will be certified to teach, student teaching evaluations will automatically be included in your credentialing file at University Career Center. </p>

         <p>The letter of application, or cover letter, should accompany every resume you send to prospective employers. A good letter introduces you to the employer, briefly states the purpose of communication, highlights pertinent information from your resume, and suggests a meeting or interview. It should not reiterate everything in the resume, but should complement and expand upon the resume. A good cover letter will provide solid reasons&nbsp;as to why the applicant should be considered further. Remember that the main purpose of a cover letter is to get the reader interested enough in you to want to read your resume. </p> 
         <p><strong>In the cover letter, remember to do the following</strong></p> 
         <ul class="default-list"> 
          <li>Type it neatly on 8 1/2" x 11" bond paper to match your resume. It should be kept clean and free of errors. </li> 
          <li>Keep it brief (no more than four paragraphs). Cut to the chase - don't ramble.</li> 
          <li>Never send a form letter. Each letter should be individually composed.&nbsp;Send an original letter and not a carbon copy; however, once a good letter has been developed, it may be used as a model many times with slight revisions. </li> 
          <li>When possible&nbsp;address your letter to a specific person, and with his/her appropriate title. </li> 
          <li>Talk about what you can do for them, and then take the initiative when closing by asking for an interview. </li> 
          <li>Use your own style of writing.</li> 
          <li>Use correct sentence structure and grammar.</li> 
          <li>Avoid excessive use of I, me, my by using introductory phrases so the personal pronoun is buried within the sentence. Example: "In addition to interning, I..." </li> 
          <li>Keep a copy of all correspondence sent for your own records. You'll be amazed how helpful this can be&nbsp;when interviews and meetings arise. </li> 
          <li>When you complete a rough draft of your letter, show it to a career counselor, professor, experienced professional, or a friend for some helpful feedback. </li> 
         </ul>

         <br>The interview is the single most important aspect in job hunting. Good grades, an excellent degree, lengthy experience, and a sharp-looking resume won't compensate for a poor impression made during an interview. You must be able to sell yourself effectively. More often than not, it is the small details such as appearance, handshake, etc., that spell the difference between being selected or rejected for a job. Be thorough in your preparation! Since each interview is unique, the more you interview the more confident and skillful you will become. 
         <p></p> 
         <h2>Preparation:</h2> 
         <p><strong>Conduct a Self-Assessment</strong>&nbsp;<em>(Take an honest look at yourself focusing on such factors as:)</em></p> 
         <ul class="default-list"> 
          <li>Personality - What kind of person are you? Strengths? Weaknesses?</li> 
          <li>Interests - What do you enjoy doing?</li> 
          <li>Abilities/Skills - What do you do well?</li> 
          <li>Values - Why do you want to work?</li> 
          <li>Goals - Where would you like to be in five years?</li> 
          <li>Experience - What have you accomplished?</li> 
         </ul> 
         <p><strong>Study the Organization</strong></p> 
         <ul class="default-list"> 
          <li>Review company literature.</li> 
          <li>Prepare important and relevant questions for the interview sessions.</li> 
          <li>Ask others about the organization.</li> 
          <li>Develop a clear understanding as to why you have selected them.</li> 
          <li>Try and discover problems the organization may have and reflect on how you might be able to help them. </li> 
         </ul> 
         <p><strong>Check Appearance</strong></p> 
         <ul class="default-list"> 
          <li>If possible visit the organization..</li> 
          <li>Notice how employees are dressed.</li> 
          <li>Pay attention to grooming, styles, etc.</li> 
         </ul> 
         <h2>The Initial Interview</h2> 
         <p><strong>Be Yourself.</strong><br>Your attitude is going to influence the interviewer's evaluation. Don't try to be someone you aren't...just be yourself. Emphasize your strong points and remember that the recruiter is looking for inherent personal energy and enthusiasm. The interview is your opportunity to sell a product and that product is you.<br><br><strong>Dwell on the Positive.</strong>&nbsp;Try always to dwell on the positive. While past failures and shortcomings need not be volunteered, don't try to cover them up or sidestep them. Should the recruiter ask about them, try to explain the circumstances rather than give excuses or blame others. Remember, the recruiter is human, too...and probably has made a few mistakes. You'll create a better impression by being honest and candid.<br><br><strong>Ask Questions.</strong>&nbsp;When Indicated. If appropriate, ask meaningful questions, particularly if you're not clear about the details of the job, the training program, or other job-related concerns, but don't ask questions just because you think that's what is expected. </p>

        </div> 
        <h3>Searching for an Internship</h3> 
        <div> 
         <p><strong>What is an Internship?</strong>&nbsp;An internship is an opportunity for students to work in an industry which matches their career interests to balance schoolwork with practical experience. An internship can be done during a summer, a semester or even a year to provide "real work" experience with a short term commitment. It may be a paid or volunteer position with part-time or full time hours. It can be done for course credit (depending on your college department's requirements) or simply for the experience. </p> 
        </div> 
        <h3>Who?</h3> 
        <div> 
         <p><strong>Brainstorm.</strong>&nbsp;What company would you like to work for someday? Begin with companies that you are interested in for future employment. Start researching companies early in your college career so you know which ones to target for your internship.<br><br><strong>Use the University Career Center.</strong>&nbsp;Texas Tech University Career Center is located at the southeast corner of the Wiggins Complex. Make an appointment to meet with the internship coordinator by calling 742-2210. Also, by registering with University Career Center, you will have access to Hire Red Raiders, an online listing of jobs and internships, over 150 company links, the capacity to preview companies which are coming to campus to conduct interviews and the ability to upload your resume for potential employers to review.<br><br><strong>Remember to use all your networks.&nbsp;</strong>What contacts do you already have through way of your family, friends, alumni, professors, previous teachers, coaches, etc. Use these contacts to your advantage.<br><br><strong>Think outside the box.</strong>&nbsp;Not all accountants work for a Big Four Firm. What other companies need accountants? Teaching also occurs outside the traditional classroom setting. Where could you use your teaching skills in a different environment? Nurses are found in more areas than just doctors' offices and hospitals. Explore all your options. You never know what will be the best fit for you until you think creatively about your skills and where they could best be used.<br><br><strong>Use the Internet.</strong>&nbsp;You can research companies and discover if they have an internship program by checking out their website.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Still not sure?</strong>&nbsp;Try conducting informational interviews. Set up a time to talk with several people who are working in your field of interest. This can be done either on the phone or in person. </p> 
         <ul class="default-list"> 
          <li>If you will meet in person, make sure to dress professionally(as if you were going to an interview). </li> 
          <li>Remember to have well thought out questions (i.e. Why did you choose this field, What is a typical day like? What does it take to be successful in this field? ). You may even e-mail your questions in advance so the person has time to think about their answers. </li> 
          <li>Ask if the company has an established internship program and what the parameters are of this program. If the company does not have an established internship program, ask if they are open to hosting intern students. </li> 
          <li>Ask the person for a business card. Start a collection of business cards from everyone you meet. These will come in handy if you have any more questions or if you decide to pursue an internship with one of the companies you have explored through your informational interviews. </li> 
          <li>Remember to respect the person's time. They are taking time out of their work schedule to answer your questions. </li> 
          <li>Send a thank you note to show your appreciation for the person's time.</li> 
         </ul> 
        </div> 
        <h3>What?</h3> 
        <div> 
         <p><strong>Course Credit?&nbsp;</strong>You will need to check with your specific department to see how many hours are required to receive course credit for doing your internship. Some programs may not offer course credit for an internship, however the experience you gain will be worth your time even if you do not receive course credit. </p> 
        </div> 
        <h3>When?</h3> 
        <div> 
         <p><strong>Plan ahead.</strong>&nbsp;Internships are usually done after the sophomore or junior year. They can be done during the summer or during the school year. Plan ahead so you can incorporate an internship into your schedule at a time that is appropriate for you. </p> 
        </div> 
        <h3>Where?</h3> 
        <div> 
         <p><strong>Wherever...</strong>Internships can be done in Lubbock, Dallas, New York, or Tokyo. You can choose the location that is best for you. Investigate your possibilities in advance so if relocation is an option, you will be prepared.<br><br><strong>Again, remember to use your contacts.</strong>&nbsp;Do you have relatives in another city who are willing to house you for a summer or a semester. Do you have a friend you could live with while doing your internship in another city? Are there some options of living with a classmate who is also doing an internship in another city or even another country? Investigate your options. You never know where the best internship for you may be until you explore the possibilities. </p> 
        </div> 
        <h3>Why?</h3> 
        <div> 
         <p><strong>Experience.&nbsp;</strong>An increasing number of students are doing internships to balance their classroom learning with real life experience. An internship provides a springboard from college life to career life, strengthens your background in your field of choice, creates the potential for future work with the company, provides potential work-related references and creates an opportunity for networking.<br><br><strong>Why not?&nbsp;</strong>Experience is never a waste of time. You will either learn that you will enjoy the field that you have decided to explore through an internship or that this field is definitely not something you would like to pursue. Either way you have learned some valuable things about career-life and have defined or redefined which direction you would like to head. </p> 
        </div> 
        <h3>How?</h3> 
        <div> 
         <p><strong>Selecting sites.&nbsp;</strong>Select two or three sites you think would meet your needs for a successful internship experience.<br><br><strong>Preparation.&nbsp;</strong>Prepare and send a&nbsp;<a href="#resume">resume</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="#coverletter">cover letter</a>&nbsp;to the Internship Coordinator at each site. (This is good practice for when you start searching for a permanent position. Plus, you never know when an internship may lead to full time employment with the company. Start with your best foot forward. This preparation will also show the internship coordinator that you are serious about gaining meaningful experience.)<br><br><strong>Making Contacts.&nbsp;</strong>Depending on the site, the Internship Coordinator may contact you for an interview or you may need to take the initiative in setting up an interview. </p> 
         <p><strong>The Interview...</strong></p> 
         <ul class="default-list"> 
          <li>Research the company in advance.</li> 
          <li>Practice your interviewing skills. Be prepared to explain the University's requirements to complete your internship and ask if these things can be accommodated. List several goals you would like to accomplish throughout your internship, things that you would like to learn from the internship, days and hours you will be available to work, how many hours you will need to complete to meet your University requirements, when you will be available to start and when you will need to be finished in order to complete the University requirements. </li> 
          <li>Make a dry run. Even if you know the company's location, it still would be wise to drive to the site in advance. You never know if there will be road construction, detours, or what the parking situation may be like. </li> 
          <li>Arrive early. (In the rare event that you may run into a delay, (i.e. unexpected accident, road delays, etc.) always have the phone number of the person who will be conducting the interview. It is better to contact the person early to inform him/her of the delay instead of explaining your tardiness when you arrive. </li> 
          <li>Take a copy of your resume, cover letter and list of professional references for quick access if these items are requested by the interviewer or in case your materials were not received in advance. </li> 
          <li>Ask when you may expect to know a definitive answer about the internship.</li> 
         </ul> 
         <p><strong>After the interview...</strong></p> 
         <ul class="default-list"> 
          <li>Remember to send a thank you letter. This is an important part of the process that many people do not take the time to do. A thank you letter shows you are courteous, that you are appreciative of the interviewer's time and that you take care of details. Write the thank you letter! </li> 
          <li>If you have not heard from the Internship Coordinator in the agreed upon time, call to check on your status. Most likely you will need to start your internship at a designated time in order to complete your required hours in a timely fashion. Calling is appropriate at this point. </li> 
          <li>Select the internship that will best serve your needs. Talk to the Internship Coordinator to establish your work schedule. </li> 
          <li>Contact the sites you did not select to decline their offers. Speak to the specific person who interviewed you. Do not just leave a message. You never know when you are dealing with a future employer. </li> 
         </ul>

         <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        </div> 
        <h3>Tips for Writing a Personal Statement</h3> 
        <div>
         The personal statement distinguishes you from other candidates and gives the panel information on "who you are." This is your opportunity to “sell yourself” to the school. It is all about you, them, and where you both can go. 
         <ol class="default-list"> 
          <li>Formal writing is expected. Be sure to always use proper grammar.</li> 
          <li>Be creative and grab attention with your opening paragraph.</li> 
          <li>Narrow the focus – not too many ideas.</li> 
          <li>Make yourself stand out by being honest and stating your truth.</li> 
          <li>Answer the questions exactly and carefully. Take some time for serious reflection.</li> 
          <li>Be sure to include personality factors, history, successes, failure, and academics.</li> 
          <li>Simple is sometimes best.</li> 
          <li>Provide passion, but more importantly provide persuasiveness.</li> 
          <li>Proofread, proofread, proofread!</li> 
          <li>&nbsp;Come into the UCC and/or the Writing Center to have your statement looked over.</li>
