The ability to theorise may the most valuable skill I take into employment.

             <!--

Working with people from many different backgrounds, some very different to my own. In turn realising that most people have something valuable to offer. The most important aspect that I have learnt so far at Middlesex, is that, no matter how insurmountable or daunting a particular task seems initially, with the right application it is achievable. </p><p> </p>

              <!--
here--> </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> I believe the SHE module taught me not to be judgmental towards others, to share ideas and work in a team by communicating with each other. All these are very important and vital in any work force, but especially in the social care field of work. I learnt to understand the concepts needed for positive group work, and to enjoy it and to contribute. I now feel I can offer something new to any work force. New students need to understand the value of contributing any ideas or theories they have which seem relevant to the work being done. Every thing does have a point and there is always somebody who can learn from you. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> I have learnt how to work with different groups of people in group situations and as individuals, listening to their ideas and adding some of my own. I have found that, just like life, education can be a cut throat situation were you share your ideas and some people just take your ideas and add their own, not sharing theirs but soaking up your information. The knowledge gained on subjects in Social Policy, looking at different policies and changes made and why, and how different policies effect different people will help me as a Social Worker. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> Working in groups, listening to others, seeing different points of views, and patience. </p><p> </p>

              <!--
here--> </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> Skills, which will help me in the future include the ability to communicate with other students in small and large group settings and being able to present work as an individual and as part of a group. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> I am learning how to work as a group. Not only that, but I am working with a group of strangers. They do not know me and I do not know them. We all have to get to know each other very quickly, so that we work better together. I think that this is a positive point because if I had to work in a team at work I would not know anyone there either. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> I think that the flexible mode of study is very relevant to employment because it teaches you to work in groups as a team and to form your own opinions and to be more self-motivated. These are seen as positive things by an employer. It also depends on what type of job you wish to go into. For example, if you are set on becoming a probation officer, then it may be helpful to choose more modules that are related to crime. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> One skill I have learned here, is how to work in groups and how it is important to identify yourself as having a certain role within a group.Also, a very important skill for future employment, is being able to talk, or present in front of people. Many people including myself find this difficult, but I feel I have definitely improved just in one semester. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> Some of the skills that most good companies are looking for it appears are IT in addition to the individual being what has been described as "a good team player." So, realistically, group work within college is an essential part of any students development as companies are more interested in someone who will not ony have the neccessary skills to do the job, but one who gets on with his fellow workers, and in the process becomes a valuable member of the company or team. </p><p> </p>

here--> </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> Networking and Socialising have helped a lot with my work and getting around a new environment. When I first came to Middlesex I did not know anyone. Now, nearly at the end of my first year, I find that I have made links with people that I would not normally talk with. I came to university straight from sixth from, but I have found that a lot of my links are with mature students who have been out of study for many years. I believe that socialising will enable me to make networks with fellow work colleges, so that I can, along with a team, climb up the ladder of success. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> As I have had lots of voluntary and work experience with all types of people, I thought that I would not need to learn about people. I admit that this was wrong as I have learned a lot about people this year, through study and socialising. It is amazing how much people change in one year. The fact that I am more open minded about things should help in a future job. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> Of course there is communication: You are faced with thousands of students not knowing anyone but eventually you make friends. For some students it is their first time away from home so it is a chance to be independent and self sufficient for the first time. This is daunting but also very rewarding. Studying for a degree takes a lot of hard work, determination, and, most importantly, staying power. It would have been very easy at times to pack it all in, but it is very self rewarding to have just about stuck it out. </p><p> </p>

Also the University is multicultural, which fits in with our society. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> I have developed good communication skills through class presentations and socialisation with other students. Also I have learned different individual and team work skills which will help me as future job skills. I have learned how to cope under pressure and how to meet deadlines. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> My communication skills have developed through presentation work. At the start of the year I was very worried about having to do a presentation in front of a lot of people I did not know. After learning a few techniques I am a little better at handling this. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> The main skills I am developing at university are communication (which I think is very important), listening and how to be objective. I am also learning how to assess my own strengths and weaknesses and those of my peers. These skills could be relevant to future employment as they are needed to deal with people at all levels, that is to say, other professionals, colleagues and clients. </p><p> </p>

These skills will be useful as I will need to work independently in employment. To get a good mark in a module, or a good degree, you need to be focused and determined to work whatever the circumstances. This focus and determination will follow you into your working life and hopefully land you the job that you want. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> The skills learnt from studying at university is knowing how to be an independent thinker and worker. You will also know how to work effectively and creatively in groups which will then prepare for working within a company where you are expected to work effectively with your other colleagues. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> Everything from your time, study, socialisation, deadlines, is left to yourself to organise. At Middlesex you are told what you need to know and are than left to complete what you have to on your own. This helps when you have to apply for a major job. You have to be dependent on yourself to phone for an interview, arrive there on time. All depends on one's own self discipline. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> Autonomous learning is a good method of gaining independence, which is a key to a good job. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> One thing that appears to be present in all social science courses is having minimum lecture time and working with groups of people, and from your own initiative. This is always going to be a skill that you will need as any job will require initiative and motivation, and the ability to interact and work with others. </p><p> </p>

Therefore, you gain a good knowledge of them. Students have to be familiar with computers before they join the workforce as almost all employment requires it. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> Most of the skills learnt at University are transferable to employment, but none are more important than IT skills. No matter what your chosen degree is, computer skills are of most importance nowadays, for most companies and businesses rely on computer networking </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> One of my modules insisted that all students use computers to submit work. If any problems were experienced, the tutor was always available to run through them with you. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> I have learned to use electronic mail, which as also been a form of communication with other students, this has been a great support. Other computer skills I learnt included use Microsoft Excel and cutting and pasting information. I think today it is vital to have a range of computer skills as computers are appearing everywhere in the workplace and I feel that future employers will be requiring people who are more and more computer literate. </p><p> <img src="greenbtn.gif"> My use of the computer has improved considerably in the last year because of being at university.

Therefore an assessment skill is important for you to obtain. A workload management skill is important. If, for example, you have to handle complex pressure from a variety of conflicting directions, then you have to organise your work carefully.

I will, on some occasions, be required to feed back vast amounts of information about clients to other professionals in these circumstances. </p><p> Student life in general often means <b>coping under pressure</b>. I regard coping under pressure to be a requirement needed in social work. Social workers often have large numbers of cases allocated to them and are expected to provided services in order of priority. There are also elements of dealing with paper work in home visits. I am quite sure that this work load can be described as pressurized, like student life. </p><p> I think the development of my <b>writing skills</b> is relevant to my future career. As a student I am still developing the skill of writing in different formats which is also a requirement of social work. For example, report writing is different from writing an essay. In my future career I will be expected to write using different formats such as reports and letters. </p></a><p><a name="SocialWork"> Learning to become familiar with the use of <b>computers</b> and the <b>internet</b> is vital for my future work as a social worker as this form of technology may be compulsory in the work environment by the time I qualify. </a><a name="Management"> </a></p><h2><a name="Management">Transferable Skills for Management</a></h2><a name="Management">
