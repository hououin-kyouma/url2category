It worked for these people.</h4\>\\n\\n<h5\>How did you get started in your profession?</h5\>\\n\\n<div class=\\\"QAanswer\\\"\>\\n<p\>A Boston College assistant basketball coach was recruiting at my high school, where I was a player on the basketball team. ... At one of our games, I approached this coach to let him know that I would be attending Boston College in the fall and that I would love to help out the coaching staff. ... This coach encouraged me to get in touch with him once I arrived on campus, which I did.<br /\>\\n&#8212;Tom DeVitt, college basketball coach</p\>\\n\\n<p\>My dentist actually offered me a job working part-time in his pediatric practice during my senior year of high school. &#8230; As I began to learn more about the field and continued to work at my part-time job as a dental assistant, my knowledge and interest increased. I found out that there was much more to the profession than just polishing teeth.<br /\>\\n&#8212;Lisa Handa, dental hygienist</p\>\\n\\n<p\>I was living with my parents at home after college, and I literally picked up the yellow pages, looked up \\\"public relations agencies\\\" and sent my r&#233;sum&#233; to a bunch that were listed. Fortunately, ... a large global PR agency contacted me about interviewing for an entry-level position in its Boston office\'s technology division. I interviewed for the job, took a few tests and landed the job.<br /\>\\n&#8212;Marcia Goff, public relations professional</p\>\\n\\n<p\>During college, I became active in a couple of professional organizations for foresters, including the Society of American Foresters. I went to chapter meetings, networked with other members and just tried to get my name around. Eventually, I met [my current employers], and I have been working for them ever since I graduated.<br /\>\\n&#8212;Eric Kranzush, forester</p\>\\n\\n<p\>When I was a student at Temple University, I was a business major, and I worked in the business office at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia. I&#8217;d spend time in the pressroom at the stadium getting to know the sports reporters. One of the reporters mentioned that his television station needed summer interns and suggested I apply. I did, landed the internship and learned about the world of reporting and television.<br /\>\\n&#8212;Chris Collins, sports broadcaster</p\>\\n\\n<p\>I went for an informational interview at Time, Inc., because a friend of mine from college was working for one of its magazines. They had me talk to someone who said, &#8220;We have a book division. Would that be interesting to you?&#8221; Working with books and authors would have been my dream since I was really young if I had thought to have a dream because I love to read books and write about them.<br /\>\\n&#8212;Caryn Karmatz-Rudy, book editor</p\>\\n\\n<p\>I started working for various commercial photographers as an apprentice, which is still commonly done today as a way to learn about the business. My first job was at ... a catalog house. Companies would hire us to take pictures for their catalogs, so I assisted photographers on these shoots.<br /\>\\n&#8212;Geoff Stein, photographer</p\>\\n\\n<p\>After I graduated, my mom suggested that I volunteer on a political campaign. ... Volunteering was really an opportunity to network and meet people in all kinds of businesses. I still didn&#8217;t know what type of business I wanted to work in, but I ended up getting interviews at several companies through the people I met. Eventually, I made it to someone who was in real estate development.<br /\>\\n&#8212;Adam Golden, real estate developer</p\>\\n</div\>\\n</div\>\",\"\",\" \",\"The Scoop: How I Got Started on My Career Path\",\"A Q&A with Professionals\",\"java.util.ArrayList/4159755760\",\"java.lang.Integer/3438268394\",\"https://www.collegeboard.org/proxy/autocomplete\",\"org.collegeboard.pacollegeplan.shared.dto.content.BreadCrumbDto/907070322\",\"Home\",\"/\",\"Explore Careers\",\"/explore-careers\",\"Careers\",\"/explore-careers/careers\",\"/explore-careers/careers/the-scoop-how-i-got-started-on-my-career-path\",\"java.util.HashMap/1797211028\",\"org.collegeboard.pacollegeplan.shared.dto.content.ExternalIdKey/1798413972\",\"collegeFinder\",\"org.collegeboard.pacollegeplan.shared.dto.content.common.PageTypeEnum/3717187543\",\"java.lang.String/2004016611\",\"/college-search\",\"actionPlan\",\"/make-a-plan\",\"seoCollegesByMajors\",\"/college-search/major\",\"seoCollegesByStates\",\"/college-search/state\",\"myOrganizer\",\"/my-organizer\",\"collegeProfile\",\"/college-profile\",\"http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/\",\"key=AIzaSyCILlyaRGg9EG0yWExy_KWlRkSDNFCudJ8\",\"Joining clubs, working, volunteering ?
