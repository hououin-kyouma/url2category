               <h3>Many people think that they know their strengths.</h3> 
               <p>I hear them say things like “I learn fast” or “I’m good with people” but most people have not spent enough time or effort to truly understand what it is that they are great at or have the potential to be great at!</p> 
               <p>Maybe these are true, but these aren’t specific enough to really be what you are great at. What is it that makes you great with people, What is it specifically that you enjoy in the interaction with others, is it even the interaction at all, or maybe something else.</p> 
               <p>When I hear something as vague as “I’m good with people”, which I do in maybe 7 out of every 10 interviews with professionals, I immediately try to start digging to understand what they really actually mean.</p> 
               <p>It could be that they are great at: relating to others OR communicating with people OR helping people problem solve OR building relationships quickly OR about a million other possibilities.</p> 
               <p>What on earth do you really mean? (<a href="https://happentoyourcareer.lpages.co/discoveryourstrengths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download our pdf version of this article for resources to help you out!</a>)</p>

               <h3>What is a signature strength?</h3> 
               <p>For the purposes of this article we are considering a true strength or one of your signature strengths to be where your skill intersects your passion. This means it’s not enough to be really good at something, in addition you must have some love or enjoyment of it too. This provides the basis for what we really mean when we say “do what you love”</p> 
               <p>We really mean, spending as much time as possible working with those things you are great at that you also really enjoy. When you get to do that on a regular basis, work starts to feel like play more and more, but you are also going to be getting superior results in your work compared to someone who’s time and activities are not well aligned with their strengths.</p> 
               <h3>How discovering your strengths can be a little confusing</h3> 
               <p>Many people tell me that I am willing to have uncomfortable conversations. I had considered that a strength for a period of time. But when I looked a little deeper I realized there was more to it: I have always been someone who gets trusted by people very easily. It helped me to be successful in other jobs and helped me to build relationships and have a lot of information because people were willing to share with me. Because people trusted me so easily and so quickly it would often make me very comfortable with them just as quickly. This enabled me to say things that others wouldn’t normally say, or deliver difficult feedback to people, or to ask for something from them that could be kind of scary.</p> 
               <p>Doing this over and over again in sales situations and HR investigations, interviews and challenging situations where you have to earn trust and provide feedback caused me to get very good at having the courage to say things others wouldn’t normally say and to be far better at that as a skill than the average person. But the real signature strength here was my ability to genuinely connect with others really quickly in a way that caused you to trust me.</p> 
               <p>This enabled me to become very good at conventionally uncomfortable conversations and drastically raised my tolerance level for such conversations.</p> 
               <p>You may realize the same for yourself when you start to unwind your own personal web of life events that lead to your signature strengths.</p> 
               <h3>How to get more specific when trying to discover your strengths:</h3> 
               <p>I’m writing this post in the hopes that I can help you break your strengths down into specifics (or at least more specific than when you started reading this)</p> 
               <p>There are many ways to do this but I want to give you several ways to go about discovering your strengths. The first way is what I do when I am interviewing others (many people don’t know their own strengths but I still have to figure them out in a short period of time spent with them during an interview)</p> 
               <p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1922" src="http://happentoyourcareer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_0951-300x225.jpg" alt="Discover your Strengths Exercise" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.happentoyourcareer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_0951-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.happentoyourcareer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_0951-600x450.jpg 600w, http://www.happentoyourcareer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_0951-1080x810.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">I start with what they really enjoyed in their last roles, previous jobs, current job, volunteering, hobbies (make a list of the couple of things you enjoy most in each one). Now which of those things would you consider yourself really good at? Which of those things caused you to be successful in other areas?</p> 
               <p>As you start to break down these lists, you will start to discover your strengths because some will surface to the top.

               <p>Ask yourself are these things that you are really good at? Are these what other people think you are great at? (sometimes what we think isn’t a big deal actually is, it just comes easy to us)</p> 
               <p><strong>Actions to take:&nbsp;</strong></p> 
               <ol> 
                <li><strong>List out all your past jobs and roles&nbsp;</strong></li> 
                <li><strong>What are the 2-4 things you most enjoyed about each of those&nbsp;</strong></li> 
                <li><strong>Answer the questions “What was it specifically that you enjoyed?” and “Why did you enjoy that part so much?”</strong></li> 
               </ol>

               <p>Here are 3 resources that we recommend on a regular basis. <a title="Resources" href="http://happentoyourcareer.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Links to all of these resources can be found here</a></p> 
               <p><strong>Strengths Finder 2.0</strong> by Gallup</p> 
               <p>A new copy of this book comes complete with an online assessment that you can take that will categorize your strengths for you. It will then give you a nice neat list of the top 5. More importantly it will share with you in detail about what makes up each strength. More often than not it is very validating and people that take it feel like it is fairly accurate. <a href="http://happentoyourcareer.com/lp/strengths-finder-2-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Well worth the $20 I paid on for priceless information about myself.</a></p> 
               <p><strong>DiSC Profile</strong></p> 
               <p>This assessment focuses on personality and communication styles. It helps you understand what your natural tendencies are which then can help you fully understand why your strengths may be your strengths. If you have a predisposition one way, that means some things will come easier to you than they do for other people. <a href="http://happentoyourcareer.com/discprofile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We recommend the DiSC profile from the 48 days store.</a></p> 
               <p><strong>The Passion Test&nbsp;</strong> by Chris and Janet Attwood</p> 
               <p>This book is a new one in the HTYC repertoire and &nbsp;is very useful for understanding how your passions play into your strengths. They ask you revealing questions that don’t allow you to shirk “figuring out” what it is that you are really passionately excited about. <a href="http://happentoyourcareer.com/passiontest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check it out here at Amazon.com</a></p>

                <p>My strength is helping others, teaching and counseling people.<br> I did most of this while in the US Navy. I’d always wanted to be a teacher and this provided me an opportunity to do that when I was a Damage Controlman. I then went on to teach fire fighting school.

                <p>Steven, I think the great news is that those are strengths that can be applied to many different career pursuits. The way that you refer to these in your comment, says to me these are things that you enjoy….so if you are in a career that doesn’t allow you to do some of this, it will probably feel like somethings missing!</p>

                <p>Awesome Allison! Great thoughts and reflection! You have some very useful strengths!</p> 
                <p>I might even push you a step further on the last two: Think about what are the things that you do particularly well (or even enjoy doing) that allow you to be a good leader in a crisis? OR what are you great at that causes you to be able to initiate change easily when others might struggle with it?</p>

                <p>I think my greatest strengths lie in being able to build relationships with students/clients that foster a nonjudgemental learning environment. I really enjoy being analytical and organized in my preparation for any work setting and having time to thoroughly put together my project/session.Being organized and analytical allows me to break down subjects into small manageable pieces, which are then much easier to understand. I’m also very good at thoroughly evaluating the pros and cons of situations before making decisions.</p>

                <p>Hi Scott! I currently work in health care. I am fortunate enough to do some part time teaching, but unfortunately the teaching does not pay the bills. The most fun I’ve had with my skills has been preparing for and implementing actual lectures. I really enjoy having the time to prepare a lecture, execute it and answer questions/continue the learning process in small groups. Students are just great to work with.</p>

                <p>Thanks Scott! Currently I am a band director and music teacher at the 5th and 6th grade level….so yes! I use these strengths daily!! However, I am curious about other things out there I might enjoy that would allow me to expand on what abilities I already know I have, and maybe make a different impact to a wider audience. I do enjoy my job overall, but the demands of the profession can be overwhelming and the climate always uncertain, hence why my explorer side has started searching for more possibilities. There is always room to grow!</p>

Since I know that it’s pretty likely that having a camera in hand is part of what the outcome will be, think about where the cross between Market need and what you want is as you go through the rest of the course.

                <p>I found this really interesting “what did you like about your last job” i didn’t like that job at all…and still i found some possible signature strengths: I am great at organizing information into a digestible format and also making it look good/clean graphically.

                <p>@disqus_p9I2219uwh:disqus This is a great strength to have. It applies to lots of different areas. Especially teaching and training. One thing that might help you is to consider “where do you enjoy using this strength the most” what types of situations and what types of people do you like to interact with. That will give you some clues as you get into the later exercises! drop us an email if you need anything at all!</p>

                <p>I have had that job too Wendy! (where I didn’t like it at all but could still pull out a couple things I enjoyed). That’s why I love those types of exercises. I am going to guess that you enjoy taking info and putting it to a digestible graphical format/building relationships/creating a safe place….and if so, these are things that you must have in your work so it doesn’t feel so grating (I think that’s how you termed it in your email…can’t remember exactly) Great job identifying some of these right away!</p>

                <p>Interesting enough, I have found different sides of myself, through looking at my current and previous job. I found in my current role, that what I am futuristic and Idealistic. I am able to envision ideas for the future and brainstorm on what something could be or should look like. In turn, from my previous job, I found that I am able to focus in on a task at hand and follow it through until it is complete. Which then, made me realize that I am able to connect with many different types of people. However, in both, I found that I am very observant and detail oriented. I am able to point things out and observe every aspect of what I am visually focusing on.</p>

                <p>So a common theme I have found is that I enjoy interacting with individuals or groups to ensure that everyone understands their role and/or what needs to be done. I also enjoy receiving feedback on the products I work on so that we can improve them. I also enjoy creating things and figuring out how to make things work for people. In order to be successful in all of my positions I have had to form relationships. I think my strength there is being genuine with people when providing feedback.</p>

                <p>I love that you already have so many areas that you know you enjoy! I would push you on each of these. Ask yourself 2 questions for each : 1) what is it specifically that I mean when I say…? (define and get specific on what you really mean) 2) Why do I enjoy or am I good at these areas? Try to get down to the root of each one. You already have a fantastic start!</p>

                <p>Looking back on my previous jobs and also my personal relationships I think I’ve come to realise that my greatest strength is one people have seen in me for a long time but one I couldn’t see in myself or really believe. </p> 
                <p>I would have to say my greatest strength is helping others by building their confidence. I’ve actually been thinking a lot latterly about what the traits are that gives me this ability to build others confidence and I would say it is listening carefully, being empathetic, having the ability to dig deeper sensitively then being able to find something in that person that they have never been able to see in themselves. I believe it’s this ability to understand others and see potential that’s not always on the surface that has also made me a good teacher and problem solver. Now what I really have to work on is really learning to recognise and appreciate my strengths in the way I seem to be able to help others to do just that.</p>

                <p>Sasha, you and I have a strength in common!</p> 
                <p>I’m so glad that you realize this about yourself, it helps to build lasting relationships, people remember that you were able to help see the best in them. It changes people in small ways that are lasting! You also know that it’s much easier to see those things if it’s not you! … I suppose that’s how we have an entire business around this type of stuff – our courses and coaching sell because even if you’re great at it, it’s still really difficult to get to those deep realizations alone 😉 </p> 
                <p>I would push you one step further and ask; with what type of people or what types of situations have you enjoyed using this strength the most? That answer may give you further clues to really refine this strength and how you should be applying it! Do like you do with others, dig a little deeper!</p>

                <p>Good questions Scott, you’ve really made me think! 🙂</p> 
                <p>I guess the people I enjoy helping the most are the people who have basically been told by family, friends, teachers or coworkers that they are either useless or have no potential.</p> 
                <p>My husband is one of these, he grew up in a small village in Laos, the youngest of 6 kids and he didn’t even get the chance to go to high school. His parents believed that he wasn’t smart enough or had any talents to get a “real job” in the town so instead pulled him out of middle school to work on the fields. Together we started the organisation Hand Up Laos to give Lao kids a chance for a better future and to help parents understand that education is important and that everyone has their own unique talents and skills that need to be nurtured. </p> 
                <p>I also enjoy helping out people like me who find themselves being the “giver” all the time and often feeling burnt out and who can’t see their own true, unique potential, talents, attributes, goodness, kindness etc.</p>

                <p>When I asked friends, collegues and I did this exercise I found 1 thing that comes back in all of them (including most of my roles): I’m good at perseverance/willpower. Thanks to this exercise I now know the specific parts I am good at</p> 
                <p>–&gt; more specifically I love setting ambitious goals, gather the necessary information to reach my goal, making a plan, stick to the plan and if it doesn’t work out reiterating and finding a way to get there. I found that I’m not affraid to fail and even though I don’t think I’m particularly talented in most things I did, I am always able to make it work in one way or the other. </p>

                <p>Thanks all for making this work and adding meaning to it. My top strengths are; 1 . putting my environment in order (tyding up) 2. Taking notes and presenting them in a meaningful way easy for follow through. 3. Helping people look their best 4. Listening, sympathising, encouraging and supporting people in their times of need. 5. Manicuring.<br> Having done the exercise and kept true to what is in me, I arrived at the five above. It is the first time I am articulating them as I have always belittled<br> my strengths. </p>

                <p>Kat, </p> 
                <p>Don’t underestimate the power of this! Another question to ask yourself is if you get to work doing these things, will you be excited to do your work. If so you are probably on track to fully identifying your Signature strengths. Another question is under what circumstances do you get to be your best in each area (what type of people around, environment, times, etc) </p> 
                <p>Nice Job!</p>

                <p>Hi Scott,</p> 
                <p>I would like to post my last few sentences of this exercise and would love some feedback if you have the time.</p> 
                <p>Here goes:</p> 
                <p>I liked that I was the person who had control in organizing and planning how things were done<br> I liked keeping records of data and referring to it to track my progress<br> I liked working with others helping them solve problems<br> I liked doing the research to uncover the “root cause” of a problem and then trying to correct that issue</p> 
                <p>I feel that I enjoyed these things so much because it gives me a sense of control and order in how things are done and </p> 
                <p>I trust myself to make the educated and informed decisions and that gives me pride</p> 
                <p>I would have to say my signature strengths are:</p> 
                <p>1. Data collection<br> 2. Organization<br> 3. Problem solving<br> 4. Researching</p> 
                <p>5. Helping others</p> 
                <p>Any feedback you provide is truly appreciated!!</p> 
                <p>Thank you Scott</p>

                <p>Shane, Awesome job. Looks like you’re off to a great start! To dive even further ask yourself “Why” on each one. Also questions like these Why do you like working with others ? when do you enjoy it most? Is it with certain types of people? What are the circumstances that you most enjoy correcting root cause issues?</p> 
                <p>Questions like these will help you even get to a deeper level of understanding. For example almost everyone enjoys helping others but when you identify what the context is, then you can start identifying how that ties into your career.</p>

                <p>Ha!!! I hope those aren’t your “greatest strengths”! Stop doing your job, get something else that allows you room to breathe. Use vacation if you have to. If it’s that bad you may find it difficult to even focus on things like this 8 day course.</p>

                <p>Hi Scott,<br> Well this is absolutely why I am taking this course. I did the exercise yesterday, going back into my past and current jobs. I feel like I had similar attributes with each job. So I’m not sure this is what your looking for but here goes.<br> !. I take pride is being on time and being depended on by other people<br> 2. I enjoy the task of taking something in the “before” state to creating the beautiful “after”. My favorite is older furniture, and when I had a nail career I always enjoyed the end polish job and nail art. Plus as a hairdresser, making people smile with their styled hair. And in my current job, taking a chunk of the earths anthracite coal in its rough state and creating a beautiful end table or coffee table out of it.<br> 3. I enjoyed listening to my clients and their life stories, but got very burned out from talking about myself if they asked. They enjoyed my “charming” personality and I loved to be with people and make them laugh and they were always stating how good a job I did. I like to feel appreciated and loved!<br> 4. I seem to be energized by working outside (of course only in the good weather 🙂<br> 5. I feel I helped people “deal” with life from some of my own experiences and energized them from ideas of projects I was doing. (furniture, folk art decorating painting, tiling my floors and woodworking projects)</p> 
                <p>I feel like this first exercise I realized I love “before” and “after” projects, I want to feel appreciated for my work (I know I shouldn’t have to, but that is part of my personality “unfortunately” – thats another course though, lol), I enjoy being with positive people and sharing my “knowledge” from my life, I enjoy being depended on for my services or to help out, I thrive if I am allowed to have my own creative ideas executed. I love to feel loved!! I want to be around positive, happy people.</p> 
                <p>Ok Scott, well I’m ready for todays exercise, so i hope this is somewhat on the path of what you expected. I know it was actually very helpful for me so far.</p>

                <p>Hi Scott</p> 
                <p>I am trying to list down the things that I liked in my previous jobs and why I think I liked them</p> 
                <p>1. Understanding work flows and setting up processes – Because I am meticulous in thinking through all aspects of the work flow and have the knack of going into the minutest detail and make it simple<br> 2. Studying data to understand trends – I like organizing and understanding the entire input and output of things and like creating, studying, structuring things to maximize efficiency, understanding and output</p> 
                <p>3. Simplifying the way things were being recorded – I like to focus on productive work rather than the ancillary things like recording information etc which I feel take some attention off the core job. So I like to organise things in such a way for my people that they are able to record required information easily and that information in turn is so organised that I don’t spend additional time to make sense of it<br> 4. Creating the training manual – I like to make people understand concepts well that can bring long term results. For that end I like making creative and capturing content </p> 
                <p>Hope I have been able to put down relevant information. Look forward to hear from you, </p> 
                <p>Thanks</p>

                <p>Hi Scott!</p> 
                <p>This is my second time around with this course! It’ll be interesting to see how it goes now that I’m in a completely different place. I’m looking forward to gaining further clarity to help me progress in both my career and my business. </p> 
                <p>My signature strengths are:</p> 
                <p>– Inspiring and leading teams in accomplishing impactful (and measurable) goals: My work with Throw Down for a Cause – annual fundraising event takes a LOT of planning, teamwork, and dedication. It’s my absolute pleasure to help lead the charge!<br> At work, I’ve lead some big process improvement efforts that will make our day to day operations easier, save the company money, and have established my team as leaders in the new wave of Lean that is happening at my company. </p> 
                <p>– Taking on a new challenge, usually something big and intimidating, and getting results: The best examples of this have been at my job over the past year. All of the reorgs in my department have resulted in increased responsibilities for me each time. I’ve stepped up, despite not feeling prepared, and rallied the team toward making some huge improvements. My group is way more visible to management now (in a good way)! </p> 
                <p>– Easily gaining the trust of others and being given big responsibilities because of it: This has been the story of my life! I was a fast food chicken place night manager at 17. I think it comes from consistent performance, solid communication skills, and the willingness to take on more responsibility. </p> 
                <p>Anyway, this was a super-fun exercise! I’d love to hear your thoughts on my strengths when you have a moment! </p> 
                <p>Thanks Scott!</p>

                <p>Scott, in completing this exercise I would have to say that my top strengths seem to be: play a key role in helping someone achieve a goal, ability to be patient and explain concepts in a way that people understand, ability to make people feel comfortable when talking to me which enables them to open up on a personal or financial level. </p>

                <p>Scott – </p> 
                <p>After doing this exercise I believe my greatest strength is analyzing a problem and coming up with a variety of solutions. In line with this is a strength of finding potential pitfalls in an existing solution or strategy. Another strength is an ability to clearly listen to and understand someone when they are explaining something and then break it down and communicate it to others in an effective way. </p>

                <p>I find that my strengths are gaining peoples trust and creating and maintaining relationships. I have really enjoyed working with team members overseas and maintain those relations some over 10 years in duration. This also has proven a strong ability to diffuse tense situations and bring a team to focus on solving the issue at hand<br> I am also very good at breaking down problems into palatable chunks and solving them systematically.<br> I Love being the “goto guy” for all parts of the organization</p>

                <p>Roger, very cool! This is such a great start! I would encourage you to even dive a bit deeper. What are the circumstances where you get to do these things and really find yourself enjoying them the most? What types of people do you enjoy working with the most that you get to open up to you? Questions like these will help you tease apart the context where your strengths benefit you and others the most (which helps provide clues as to the way you should be spending your time!)</p>

                <p>Lilly, don’t underestimate that ability to look at multiple solutions! This isn’t necessarily very easy for most other people… Where do you find that you enjoy doing this the most and that it comes most natural to you (what evironments or with what type of people or what context?) If you these strengths down a little farther and examine the “why” behind it, I will help you understand where you will find the most enjoyment!</p>

                <p>William, I also love being that “goto” guy! I found for me it was only in certain situations, problems and people (not necessarily across the board)! Some things I just found more enjoyment than others. Examine also how you build trust (because there are lots of ways to do it) and how you create and maintain relationships and what you specifically do. I would be willing to bet it’s probably slightly different than what I enjoy. Another example of this is my friend mark (see him at <a href="http://sieverkropp.com" rel="nofollow">http://sieverkropp.com</a>) he is a relationship expert, but his sweet spots and his true strengths (and the things he gets the most joy out of ) are connecting others and knowing that something great came of that connection, and being helpful in ways that cause him to stick out in the minds of others. It also makes him happy to be connecting with other people in small ways at all times…. and he is amazing at this! </p> 
                <p>I’m not, I prefer to build relationships by listening amazingly well, be super curious about people’s stories (which I find interesting) and say things to people that nobody else would ever tell them. Two drastically different ways to build relationships… </p> 
                <p>You’re probably different than both of us! So… figure out what those things are for you!!!</p>

                <p>i believe that top strength is developing others. The roles that I had includes training, instructing, and managing.

                <p>I believe one of my top strengths is so gain people’s trust through listening and empathizing. I have worked a lot in commercial and (more recently) residential interior design and space planning. From that I so believe my other top strength is to listen to specific needs and being able to find a solution through organizing information through both analytical and creative processes. I do enjoy organizing and maximizing space but I also enjoy organizing information into our design binders and I also recently created a digital filing system to keep track of projects at my current job.</p>

                <p>I find this very difficult. I really have no idea what are my strengths. This is the first step of every “find the right career for you” program I’ve seen and it has always stopped me from progressing to the next step.<br> The exercise of listing jobs and what you liked about them seems pointless. I’ve never had a job I liked; I needed to earn a paycheck to survive, so I did.</p>

                <p>No worries Scott, you don’t have to keep going through the program. If you think it’s pointless there is nothing that I or anyone else will be able to do to help you!</p> 
                <p>What I’ve found though is every person I’ve ever worked with on this type of exercise (thousands) is that once you push past the initial “I didn’t like any of my jobs” there really are pieces (maybe just small pieces) that you either slightly enjoyed or were better than everyone else at. These are probably things that come more naturally to you than to others – and you don’t realize what they are! This exercise simply helps you look for those clues in a strategic way. </p> 
                <p>Another way to short cut putting some verbiage to your strengths is to use Strengths Finder 2.0.(Link Above) It won’t tell you what to do with them, it will simply help you to understand a little more about yourself.<br> Remember the reason most people have no clue is because it is difficult work.</p>

                <p>Scott,<br> This was not easy, by any means. I tried to think back on the last several years of career experiences to gather my top strengths from based on what I found most enjoyable at each one. Because my current career path seems to result in very high levels of stress and discomfort, this was challenging, but here goes!<br> 1. I am very much so an introvert and do cherish my alone time to recharge, however, I find in many of my positions I would enjoy problem solving with small groups or one on one. This may be a client or staff member, but I very often had the ability to listen, be empathetic and yet remain objective enough to help them work through or resolve whatever issue was at hand. This type of encounter frequently gave me goosebumps, the good kind.<br> 2. I am very good at hands on work, but particularly the kind that requires high precision. I work in the medical field, and much of the medical environment makes me strangely uncomfortable for someone who has been in it as long as I have (14 years). But I have always been strong at procedures and find great enjoyment in using my hands as tools. Looking back before I embarked on my adulthood career path I was a very artistic child. So it’s no wonder that I find enjoyment in using my hands in the medical field. In this way, medicine and medical procedures take the place of art and creation.<br> 3. I am very detail oriented and good at editing. I can pick apart documentation and audit charts for errors and inconsistencies like a champ. I am quick and methodical and have found I can carry on with this level of work that many find mundane for hours. No goosebumps though. There are moments that I do feel a bit of a “gotcha!” moment when I find errors and that can be fun. Like working a complicated puzzle. I like figuring things out.<br> Very enlightening exercise. It took me 2 days instead of 1. Ready for step 2!!!</p>

                <p>My top strength is working with people in efforts to change their lives for the good. My career path has always consisted of working with children and families as a support worker or social worker. I love to help people come up with ways to improve their lives. The problem I’m having is that it’s a very stressful field that negatively impacts my health. So now I’m trying to figure out a career change or position change that is less stressful and enjoyable. I enjoy more intimate settings…working one to one rather than large groups. </p>

                <p>Hi Scott. Thanks for sending the 8 day program. After reviewing this article I wrote down what I liked the most about my jobs and my volunteer/personal time. It seems to be clear that I prefer researching, organizing processes, and generally making things easier/better. I’m not sure how to use this information yet, but hopefully the next few sessions will give a little more clarity.</p>

                <p>Scott, thank you for this course and being so inspirational. I did the exercise and I did the Strengthsfinder 2.0. </p> 
                <p>It all comes down to this: Gave me a sense of worth and importance and that I am not only leaving an impact but also adding value. </p> 
                <p>According to the Strength Finders 2.0 My strength are Futuristic, Individualism, strategic, discipline and realtor. </p> 
                <p>They recommended that I work for small businesses in a management position. This makes a lot of sense to me, and why I absolutely despised my previous formal jobs. It also makes sense as to why I love two extremes, photography and organizing and out of necessity for my husband and I’s business tech support because they both contribute a sense importance and demand. There is a sense of order and discipline involved, and what I love most about photography is capturing that image that leaves people breathless, especially when capturing people and their emotion and the way that God sees them. </p> 
                <p>Discovering my strengths has been a two year journey. I am finally starting to see it all coming together!</p>

                <p>My top strength is Intellection. I am a problem solver, I like to think, and I’m introspective. Typically about many, many topics. I’m always thinking and pondering about something, and often see solutions when others fail to. I love to learn, often studying multiple courses at a time.</p>

                <p>My strengths still seem slightly vague/broad, but this exercise definitely got me thinking in a more specific way about what they are. I feel I have the to ability to instruct an individual/group in a very approachable manner by reading the situation quickly and anticipating their needs. I enjoy taking charge and can be flexible when put on the spot. In contrast this exercise also made me think of and come to terms with some of my weaknesses. This wasn’t so much a negative as it helped highlight what it is at work I like doing. Relating to people and making people feel welcome and calm gives me a sense of fulfillment and can be empowering. I know how to do this as a server in a restaurant and as a dance teacher, but am hoping this course will help me see that my strengths can be utilized even in a very different career.</p>

                <p>I really loved this article. It really made me go way back in time. This has confirmed what I always thought my passion was. I love to help people solve their problems and guide them into searching deeper and to transform their lives. I am a problem solver in other words and very introspective as well. One of my other strengths is guiding people in their careers or business, like how to market their products, where to market, etc… I also love to talk to teenagers about their future and what they want to do and guide them in how to get there. I really get a kick out of it!</p>

                <p>This was as hard to do as I thought it would be. I did end up coming up with some of my strengths that overlap with my passions thanks to the ‘actions’ in this article. I think I am very good at building relationships and trust with others, and can empathize very well. I love having fun and am good at creating a fun atmosphere for others to enjoy. I have a strong hard wired need to make any job I do meet or exceed expectations. </p>

                <p>At the beggining I had problems, because I did not acquire yet a lot of working experience, and even those experiences are connected mostly to similar and specific work projects. But I the end I could identify few strenghts, for which I think they can be my significant strenghts. I will share them bellow.</p> 
                <p>However – I also noticed, was that at the “beggining” of my working career I participated in activities that required completely different skill set, or that required different group of skills than the activities where I participate now.<br> Scott could you share your thoughts on that?<br> And also – I am interested – how diverse should strenghts be? Because I think mine are quite connected and intracorrelated. When thinking about our strenghts – should we think also to find strenght that we one can connect with different skill sets or we just really look for things that are we good at and that we enjoy?<br> Thank you for your answer in advance 🙂 </p> 
                <p>Now – my strenghts – I am really good at 1) novelity search – looking out, getting to know and understand new concepts which can be implemented into existing structure or can represent base for creating new concept or process from scratch; 2) automatizating, organising and simplifying processess of work, specially with use of IT tools; 3) creating meaningfull and usefull content out of provided data, by analysis, comparison and seeking for intra-correlations, with intent to provide users information with added value.</p>

                <p>Hi scott. During college I went with a career that required no pushing but however I found out how my past shaped my life. I I choose to work with all types of people. Jobs out there I didn’t even need a degree for. However the people skills are very useful for I want to take this to explore a career in the business world… not sure of my target field. I never appilied myself not self myself up for success which to me is financial freedom to have a job (not two like I have had to try pay my debts down and save). </p> 
                <p>During observations, interpreting verbal and nonverbal behaviors. Following up behaviors with teachable moments to transfer and reinforce person’s strengths. Asking specific questions to detail the affects to evaluate the current the stages of change the person is in. Ability to create a time lines of patterns to include progress or regression to show examples of the interventions effectiveness or not. </p> 
                <p>Opportunity to grow along with the family to be part of the success to utilize my personal strengths unique to the family’s situations. Using the family’s past successes to empower people to change thought processes to shift focus from a negative mind set to focus on positives of what they do have.</p>

                <p>Hi Scott, </p> 
                <p>i think my strength are : to listen carefully people especially when they are disabled or old ; having a great accent in english ( talking to some native one that tell me that) ; sing when i’m alone or juste with few people (not sure it’s one) ; play card games or word games (like scrabble). like taking care of animals as do some salads or hug…</p>

                <p>The problem for me is my DiSC is on the opposite side of both spectrums (High C, High I), and my Strengthsfinder is all over the place. This also reflects in my career. From customer service to inventory control to quality inspection. I enjoy the systems and I enjoyed optimizing them for me, but I also enjoyed exploiting holes in the system that would make it easier for me to work and get it done much faster.</p> 
                <p>The old “If you aren’t cheating, you aren’t trying” adage. </p> 
                <p>Meanwhile, the things I thought I really enjoyed (writing, art, creativity) really don’t get me excited. I am also not focused on achieving anything. I am in a “pin me-pay me” phase of my life. Do the job, make others look better, get a paycheck, go home, meditate and get some sleep.</p> 
                <p>And that isn’t a constant in my career either, of course. This just changed over the last 5 years.</p> 
                <p>So the exercise in itself didn’t reveal much since I have changed so much since I first started my career path. I was a different person because I hid being sexual abused and a near suicidal depression. Now that I am not hiding it, I am certainly looking at things in a different way.</p> 
                <p>Any idea where I can start after all of this?</p>

                <p>Years ago I found out about Strengths Finder 2.0 – I took the test, and my first strength is Empathy. I remembered being floored. I was an engineer at the time, and uhm Empathy is NOT the initial strength I would expect from an engineer profile.<br> My DiSC S/I – so I guess that makes sense.</p>

                <p>So…this is the second time I have done the 8 day mini course. lol. I did it, and didn’t finish, back in November. At which time I ended up pretty much putting the career blinders on and backsliding telling myself that it was “what I needed” right then. Obviously not, because here I am again! </p> 
                <p>I actually just scrolled all the way back to my original response and I’m pleased to say, many of the things I spoke about in my first response remain consistent. My view on the, however, has changed. </p> 
                <p>Last November I mentioned some strengths of mine being; empathy &amp; listening skills, hands on tasks and attention to detail. These are still things I am pretty good at! But after really diving into my past jobs and searching for the reason WHY I enjoyed these things so much, I started seeing a different theme. I, apparently, like to be the hero. Being able to listen to people, when so many people feel unheard today, made me a hero. Excelling at technical hands-on tasks, which I could control with practice, made me a hero to my clients and my employers. Colleagues looked to me for advice and assistance with these tasks (hello ego-trip!). Same goes for being detail oriented. Although, I wouldn’t say I really find a great amount of enjoyment anymore in editing work for errors anymore. I think I am good at it, and it was something that was easy to hide behind at the time. </p> 
                <p>After completing the DISC profile, I get it now. I am an S. And I am steady for sure! It is my biggest strength and my biggest weakness. That S sure makes me dependable and reliable, but also gets a person stuck in a career that doesn’t necessarily fit for 18 years. 😉 </p> 
                <p>Last year, I didn’t dig as deep as I needed to. I didn’t do the DISC profile. I didn’t get Strengths Finder 2.0 or the Passion Test. I half-assed it. I can’t dread Monday through Friday for the next 30 years, so no more half-assing it.</p>

                <p>Very helpful and insightful exercise! </p> 
                <p>Realized that some of my key strengths are:<br> – training individuals one-on-one<br> – researching to troubleshoot a problem or issue<br> – developing creative ways to present information or content i.e. client presentations<br> – bringing organization or structure to a new process </p> 
                <p>All skills which I am currently not using in my current job 🙂</p> 
                <p>BTW, does anyone know if the DISC profile is available to be completed online? On the 48days.com website, it looks like the only option available is to order a CD.</p>

                <p>I took the Strengths Finder 2.0 about 3 years ago during my MBA and my top strength at the time was Achiever. About a year ago, after a couple more years in management and after I finished my MBA, I retook the assessment from the Strength Based Leadership book and my top strength changed to Maximizer. They were both correct at the time I took the assessments, but my focus had changed from being about myself to being about teams and individuals and helping them become the best they can be.</p> 
                <p>I did the DISC assessment a long time ago, being high D with secondary high I (extremely low C and low S); it still fits: I’m a highly driven, take-charge person who readily connects with people of all different backgrounds, but a really low tolerance for wishy-washy, b.s., or unauthentic people.</p> 
                <p>What I’ve enjoyed doing and what people say I’m good at that I just take granted:<br> – listening without judging<br> – coaching and advising, empowering individuals to shine<br> – building effective, cohesive teams that are also resilient during high-stress projects<br> – getting things done, finding the way through roadblocks</p> 
                <p>I haven’t done the Passion Test yet – just ordered the book and looking forward to taking it. I’m also just starting the 8-day mini course and looking forward to digging in!</p>

                <p>Scott,<br> I just finished my exercise that has indeed been quite useful to determine what I think my strengths are. I believe my strengths are:</p> 
                <p>1 – Creating solid and trust based relationships by listening actively to people, providing feedback and other coaching that in the end results in tremendous loyalty.</p> 
                <p>2 – Ability to break down complex issues into small steps that are easier to solve</p> 
                <p>3 – Curiosity and willingness to learn pretty much anything which in the end provides me with a solid base knowledge on many topics.</p> 
                <p>4 – Always keeping a long term perspective on investment that drives consistent solid returns and therefore pushing for the harder right vs. the easier wrong.</p> 
                <p>I would be happy to hear your provocative thoughts, questions or comments. I might find that something has been missed out.</p>

                <p>I wander if me answering these questions make the whole thing biased. for example I know that I love digging into anything because of probably my anxiety of unknown and the security that comes with knowing ever nook and corner of anything. Be it cleaning up a place/drawer so you know what’s in there (I’ve been doing that since I was a little girl) to figuring out what processing are going on in the company. So I lit this as something I really enjoyed at my last job – learn what’s going on, in the majority of cases I would see improvident that could be made and then document, try to put in place better practices. How do I know that this is my strength? May be it is just something I noticed myself doing and it is not a strength at all.</p>

                <p>Hello Scott</p> 
                <p>Had a good time doing this exercise. I always ‘knew’ my strengths in the back of my mind but never took the time to write them down.</p> 
                <p>My strengths would be:</p> 
                <p>1. Taking very complicated systems and breaking them down into simple actions that can be easily completed.</p> 
                <p>2. Being the person people find to solve complex, technical issues that involve government agencies, clients and internal processes.</p> 
                <p>3. Willing to get my hands ‘dirty’ when need be, willing to try anything and being optimistic about it.</p>

                <p>Hi Scott,</p> 
                <p>I did the exercice but not yet read all the resources put at our disposal. Hope to read them this week.<br> It was not easy to think on my strenghts, but they would be:</p> 
                <p>1. Writing documents (reports, projects, minutes, etc.) and put together texts, pictures/images in a beautiful and creative way. By doing this, I have the feeling that I am telling my clients and fellows “Eh, look see how I pay attention to you. I want you to get right information in a beautiful package”.</p> 
                <p>2. Managing projects by planning in details and breakdown the project in simple activities. By doing this, it makes it clear to everyone and each one knows what to do and what is our goal. “Let’s make it simple “ is my moto.</p> 
                <p>3. People rely on me when it comes to preparing a project or support them in writing their project. They know I would do it.</p>

                <p>I though I had my list of strengths, but realized that many were too broad or vague, so I added more details to flesh them out. Here’s what came out:</p> 
                <p>1) Social awareness: Sensible to interests of others, showing empathy / Being able to see myself in other person’s position / Listening attentively / Respecting the ideas and opinions of other people</p> 
                <p>2) Problem solving: Ability to find paths to solutions, even in confusing situations</p> 
                <p>3) Self management: Earning the respect of others by my behavior / Able to set aside my self-interest for the betterment of groups or organization / Thinking and behaving like an adult / Aware of my strengths and weaknesses</p> 
                <p>4) Managing relationships: Building goodwill throughout my network / Finding common ground with stakeholders / Can tackle difficult topics without alienating people</p> 
                <p>5) Managing people: Being fair, even-keeled / Accepting responsibilities and blame – giving credits to others / Delegating work that should be done by others / Encouraging staff to develop their capabilities</p> 
                <p>6) Getting work done: Consistently doing what I said I would do / Responsive to urgent matters / Maintaining steady progress on most important priorities / Delivering optimal results (even if that means veering off from the original plan)</p> 
                <p>7) Strategic thinking: Recognizing the need for change / Analyzing future scenarios to guide present day actions / Taking a long-term view of decisions</p> 
                <p>8) Communicating effectively: Presenting ideas clearly / Speaking with confidence in front of large groups of people / Writing succinctly and with clarity</p>

                <p>Hi HTYC,<br> Reluctantly going outside my comfort zone by posting but I suppose it may help. </p> 
                <p>But… in the spirit of this adventure: </p> 
                <p>I like answering the question, “How can we make this better?”<br> I like gathering data, evaluating it, and analyzing it so I can design a plan to make something better. (“Better” is relative, and can mean any number of things.) Unfortunately, I’m not sure these are strengths of mine because I haven’t had a lot of practical (read ‘job’) experience, but it’s something I’ve noticed about myself, and it’s something my brain just naturally does. {Perhaps it’s just because I often find myself in a new situation I don’t understand, and in my attempt to comprehend it, I evaluate it and re-organize it in a way that makes sense to me, but which isn’t necessarily “better.”} </p> 
                <p>Anyway, that’s it. That’s what I like to do, and I *think* I’m good at it. Additionally,</p> 
                <p>-I’m good at reading and doing research.<br> -I can easily write summaries.<br> -I’m a decent writer. (That’s debatable I’m sure.)<br> -I’m a decent diagram/schematic/line diagram creator and could probably be very good with additional practice.<br> -I have strong analytical skills. I enjoy analyzing the big picture (systems) and seeing how one part relates to the whole. I’m doing this constantly–it’s just what my brain does.<br> -I’m good at evaluating ideas and information.<br> -I’m good at devising a strategy, policy, proposal, or a plan for the improvement of some system.<br> -Others tell me I’m a good listener.</p> 
                <p>Thank you. Now… what can I do with these?<br> All best.</p>

                <p>I took the StrengthFinder2.0 in January and it nailed my strengths: Learner, Achiever, Input (inquisitive), Activator (make things happen) and Inquisitive (like to think). Digging down into the explanations for each really gives you some good insights, and helps you puts words around, what really fuels your passions.</p>

                <p>There are times that our top five signature themes change. Personally, I simply ask people to re-read their reports and if they nod more than they shake their heads, then I tell them there’s no need to retake the assessment. Spend time action planning based on their current themes instead.</p>

                <p>I’ve taken Gallup’s strength finder in the past, but completing the exercise in this article really helped me pinpoint both what I’m good at and what I most enjoy in all the work I’ve ever done. I can’t sum this up in a word or two, but I’ve realized that I’m happiest at work when I get to bring many people together for a complex project and to manage it through to successful completion. I like to help people succeed, and to bring them together in a way to create something amazing.</p>

                <p>Hello! </p> 
                <p>Sounds like you have some pretty amazing strengths in your corner :)… and that you might be ready for some kind of change. I had a really great manager– who’s since traded his business suits for hiking boots– who was rather infamous around the office for following that kind of question… with another question. (Or three.) Ask yourself: What is this telling me? How can I (1) lever these strengths/attributes in what I do now? How can I (manager) help you, or more accurately help *yourself*? (2) If the kind of change your after — which it seems that you are– isn’t something you feel you can grow into here, then it might be time for a change. Even if it means *giant…GULP* leaving your position, going to another company or ** even bigger GULP** striking out on your own.</p> 
                <p>How would you answer those questions above? Do some thinking on it…. and in the meanwhile, the DISC could really help you. You’re right, you can order a DVD. I also found Tony Robbins hosts a free version that is *shockingly accurate*, and comes in a literally 50-plus page (PDF) report. I had heard of it before… and then a recruiter asked me to take it as a pre-screening measure. *Hoooly… Swiss cheese* I think is what i said. </p> 
                <p>Here’s the link to the Tony Robbins version (I think they invented it??): <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/disc/" rel="nofollow">https://www.tonyrobbins.com/disc/</a></p>

                <p>Okay, I have a lot of thoughts here, so I’m going to break it down:</p> 
                <p>Combining StengthFinder and this exercise also helped me dig deeper in what I like to do- though I’m anxious to find out how to translate this into a career. I’m a librarian by profession, and have always loved the intersection of teaching and learning. Perhaps a little too much, as I tend to go down the research rabbit hole- but that can explain some of my themes (Input, Intellection and Learner). Not sure how my other themes (Deliberative and Adaptability) may play into this. </p> 
                <p>To respond to the signature strengths question, my answer has multiple parts, as they interweave a lot. </p> 
                <p>1. I love helping people find what they need because I can see the impact that I’ve had on their thinking, walking through problem solving and empathizing along the way to draw out answers (what they say they need is not always what they’re looking for.) I also love the research aspect to it because I can learn something new as I teach someone how to conduct library research (booleans, truncation, etc). </p> 
                <p>2. I also enjoy being the point person that does the legwork for research or multiple departments, because (again) it allows me to learn new things and provides the opportunity to play superconnector or mentor with colleagues across disciplines. </p> 
                <p>Other things I’m not sure how to characterize exactly- I’ve been told I have a calming demeanor and voice, where friends, colleagues and patrons have thanked me for listening and being around them. I find I can act level headed when others need help, but I often struggle to follow my own practices.</p>

                <p>Wow, super exercise that helped me drill deeper into why I enjoy certain aspects of my work, which brought me to an “Aha” moment about why I’m so unsettled in my current role.</p> 
                <p>My five themes from the Strength Finder were: Developer, Empathy, Relator, Maximizer and Organizer. My DISC assessment showed me to be an “Advisor” or an “Si”, which also highlighted why my current role is not a satisfying as I want it to be.</p> 
                <p>When I examined things I liked doing in my current role, and past roles, it quickly became apparent that I love communicating with people to make them feel heard and understood, and to guide them to resources that will help them resolve issues or find answers. I love this because I feel useful and derive satisfaction from helping others. I also love work that allows me to enter a flow state without interruption, that has a tangible result (reviewing and summarizing settlement claims, for example).</p> 
                <p>These insights have been really helpful. I’m looking forward to the next exercise!</p>

                <p>Hi! I think many of those questions didn’t make a lot of sense insofar as the answers to them are not mutually exclusive. Both ends of the spectrum, in many cases, could be described as true for me. </p> 
                <p>In any case, my top 5 strengths are:<br> 1. Adaptability<br> 2. Empathy<br> 3. Harmony<br> 4. Intellection<br> 5. Arranger</p> 
                <p>As far as examining my current and past roles, the themes that rise to the top are:</p> 
                <p>1. researching information and resources and vendors in order to achieve my/my team’s goals.<br> 2. working to create things (products or experiences) that please and delight others<br> 3. connecting and collaborating with others in order to achieve #2<br> 4. receiving praise and recognition for #2</p>

                <p>Wow! I’m so glad we started with this exercise because I was able to identify the strengths that have led to promotions and career advancement, but the most important pervasive two are that I am methodical and analytical. This has made me exceptionally good at standardizing communication (by conceiving and creating templates), creating and implementing processes and procedures, and making sure that the processes and procedures don’t have ‘blind spots’ or ‘holes’ that need to be fixed later.</p>

                <p>This excerise was so much harder than I had anticipated. I have always been proud of the fact that I can own up to my shortcomings, but my specific strengths were challenging! My strengths finder strengths were harmony, restorative, analytical, relator, and intellection. And my specific strengths would be the ability to see through the “noise” of a complicated problem and get to the core issue(s), my ability to make meaningful connections with people through my honesty and my sense of humour, doing the “research” to work through a problem that interests me whether through mentors, books, internet etc, and that I have a good “gut” instinct about people and I can usually find a point of connection despite how different our views are.</p>

                <p>Loved looking back at what I liked in my previous jobs. Common themes of helping others achieve goals and having clear tasks to do were there right from my first job as a teenager. I worked on an IT project a few years ago where my enjoyment of building rapport through empathy and teaching others were realized and the same role saw my strengths in “reading the room” to determine if individuals understood training material or instructions identified. Was happy to see Individualization as my top strength in Strength Finder 2.0 followed by Empathy, Relator, Developer and Harmony. Interesting stuff!!! Thank you!</p>

                <p>The common themes for me were interacting with others, helping others by researching and problem-solving and thriving in stressful situations. I will be using the Strength Finder 2.0 soon and I also bought the book “The Passion Test” and I look forward to narrowing my strengths down even further.</p>

                <p>I spent a good few hours going through the exercises and this is what I came up with for my signature strengths (draft): 1) Learning and applying my skills and creativity to problem solve and create tangible solutions; 2) Fostering a harmonious and collaborative working environment; and 3) Organise, plan and execute complex tasks and events. I had recently done the Strengths Finder 2.0 and incorporated some of those results into what I came up from the exercise. It was definitely a challenging exercise and got me thinking. I found there was a clear distinction between what I am good at and enjoy doing (signature strengths) and the reasons why I like doing those things (they aligned closely with my values). Looking forward to day 2!</p>
