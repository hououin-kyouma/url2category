        "articleBody": "Senior year of college — particularly the second semester — is tricky. You want to “take it all in,” enjoy your last months on campus with your friends before “the real world” comes calling. But you also need to gear up for your post-graduation job hunt, work on your resume, and start seeking out opportunities and connections. It’s a scary thought, for sure, but it doesn’t have to be a scary process, or even one that totally consumes your final college days. These tips from career experts will help you smartly and efficiently begin your job search, and make all the right moves as you go along. \n\n__DO: Utilize LinkedIn__   \n\nLinkedIn is a community completely dedicated to professional networking, and its benefits for any job-searchers are practically endless. Create a profile, and you can easily connect with people you meet, gather information about companies, industries, and potential employers, and follow [LinkedIn Influencers](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/discover) for valuable tips and knowledge. And of course, aside from helping you build your network, LinkedIn serves as a digital resume and portfolio that anyone in a hiring position can — and likely will — view, which is why LinkedIn career expert, [Catherine Fisher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherinefisherlinkedin), tells *Teen Vogue* it’s crucial for recent grads to have a presence on the site. “It’s incredibly important [for recent grads] to show up professionally and be where those recruiters and hiring managers are,” she said. Be thoughtful about what you include on your LinkedIn profile to tell the most compelling story. Aside from simply listing internships and skills, Fisher recommends including any relevant experience you can think of (like managing the social media pages for any campus activities), and even uploading examples of your work (like major presentations you did for classes). “It’s so important to include those things, because…that real life experience can really transfer well into the professional world, but if you’re not including that in your profile, no one would ever know,” Fisher said. \n\n__DON’T: Assume your social media is private__   \n\nIn a perfect world, your online presence would be as private as you want it to be, but it’s not a perfect world, and even when you think your social media accounts are only for your eyes, chances are, they’re vulnerable to strangers’ views, too. “You have to assume that everybody is reading [your social media posts],” Abby Kohut, a recruiter and career consultant at [AbsolutelyAbby.com](http://absolutelyabby.com/), tells *Teen Vogue.* “People are posting pictures of themselves drinking at parties, and that’s not going to work. If you post those pictures, employers are not going to hire you. They’re also putting up curse words…and talking in slang…and employers are seeing those things, and they’re making judgments about you, and you don’t want them to do that.” If you’re not sure whether or not something is appropriate to share on social media, follow Kohut’s advice: “Don’t ever put anything on any of these sites that you wouldn’t want your parents, your pastor, or your new boss to see.” \n\n__DO: Put yourself out there__     \n\nNetworking is crucial to landing any job, and though it can be scary to put yourself out there, reach out to people you don’t know, and ask for help, it can be wildly beneficial. “Any time you meet someone you think could help you with your professional journey, connect with them on LinkedIn,” Fisher said. “Most people want to help you. [Be] very deliberate and thoughtful in terms of your approach, but not shy about asking for help.” Fisher recommends looking at your 2nd degree connections on LinkedIn — basically, people you don’t know directly but have mutual connections with. If you want to connect with someone at a specific company, and you notice that you have a shared connection with that person, don’t be afraid to reach out to that friend or acquaintance you have in common and ask for an introduction. “That is incredibly powerful and totally acceptable,” Fisher said. \n\nThe good news: You likely already have some networking skills in your back pocket. “You don’t have to be super outgoing to network effectively,” Ariella Coombs, a millennial career coach and contributor to sites like [Careerealism](http://www.careerealism.com/author/ariella/) and [CareerHMO](http://careerhmo.com/) tells *Teen Vogue.* “You and I both grew up with the Internet. Chatting online comes easy to us. So, start with what comes easy to you. Look at your list of target companies, then go on LinkedIn and invite them to connect. Then, shoot them a message and [start a dialog](http://careerhmo.com/start-conversation-linkedin-connection/).” \n\nYou should also try to utilize alumni lists from your schools and even try reaching out to your parents' friends who may be involved in an industry you find interesting. \n\n__DON’T: Wait until you graduate to get started__  \n   \n“Believe me, I know it’s tempting to put off your job search until after graduation so you can enjoy every last bit of your college glory days,” Coombs says. “However, it’s probably not in your best interest to hold off. It can take months for you to get a job. Moreover, the longer you’re out of work, the less desirable you become to employers. So, don’t put it off!” \n\nStarting early doesn’t necessarily mean applying to jobs before you even take your first senior year class, though. It’s also very much about building your network while you’re still in college, so that by the time you do start seriously searching, you’ll have plenty of connections and resources to work with. \n\n__DO: Ask for recommendations__   \n  \nRather than wait until a potential employer asks you for references, be proactive and ask for recommendations that you can include on your resume from the start. A professor who can vouch for your character, work ethic, and critical thinking skills, for example, can be priceless when you're trying to land your first job. While a glowing recommendation from anyone is great, Fisher recommends you consider people you’ve encountered — professors, mentors, coaches, or internship bosses — who have a direct connection to your desired industry for the most powerful effect.  \n\n__DON’T: Apply for anything and everything__     \n\nSure, when you’re applying to jobs, you want to give yourself options — but that doesn’t mean submitting your resume to every semi-relevant job you find. “Do not blanket your resume to hundreds of organizations, and don’t apply for every entry-level opening at a company,” Miriam Salpeter, owner of [Keppie Careers](http://www.keppiecareers.com/), tells *Teen Vogue.* “It makes you look unfocused.” Coombs recommends making a list of the top 10 companies you’d like to work for, and start from there.     \n\nAnd once you do start applying, be sure to tailor each application — and the resume you send with it — to the specific company and job you’re applying for. “It’s best to spend time on each application and be careful to avoid mistakes, such as sending a cover letter meant for one company to another organization,” Salpeter says. “[Identify] and [include] targeted keywords in your resume and online materials. If you are applying for jobs and hoping for the best, you may as well dig a hole and throw your resume inside, and place an ‘RIP’ tombstone on top.” \n\n__DO: Think outside the computer__  \n   \nWe spend so much time online these days, that we sometimes forget it is possible to do things the old fashioned way. “Another great way to get a first job is to simply put on a suit and get a leather portfolio with a bunch of resumes in it, literally walk into the door at a company or retail store, look like you’re a very professional person, and say that you want a job,” Kohut says. “They will very likely have you fill out an application on the spot and very likely hire you, because no one is doing this. Just walking in and asking for a job is not something people are doing right now, so if you do that, you stand out from the crowd for sure.” \n\n__DON’T: Rely on online job boards__  \n   \nAnd even if you do stick with the Internet, it’s still important to make meaningful connections via LinkedIn and personalized emails. “If you want a super outdated and ineffective way to apply for jobs, online job boards are your best bet,” Coombs says. “Online job openings are typically flooded with applicants, making it very hard to stand out. Moreover, your resume will likely go through an automated filtering system (called an ATS) and if it’s not an exact match, it will be tossed out before it even gets read by a human. Basically, applying online is like the *Hunger Games* of job search. May the odds be ever in your favor…” \n\nThere’s nothing wrong with finding leads and information from online job boards, but once you see something that interests you, research a different way you can get in: Look on LinkedIn for people at that company with whom you may have mutual connections, or call the human resources department directly and ask for more information on what they’re looking for. You may even be able to connect with the hiring manager in charge of that role, and skip right to the top of her list. \n\n__DO: Know — and communicate — what you bring to the table__  \n   \n“The most successful candidates understand the connection between what they have to offer and how it relates directly to the employer’s needs,” Salpeter explains. “It’s crucial to focus on how the job seeker can help, not on what the job seeker wants in return.” When writing your cover letter, or sitting in an interview, focus less on why you need and want the job, and what you’ll get out of it personally, and more on why you’re the ideal fit for their needs.  \n\nIf you’re not sure what that is, take some time to figure it out before you start applying. “In order for a company to offer you a seat, the employer needs to know what you bring to the table,” Coombs says. “That means you need to have a clear idea of what you offer in terms of value. Why are YOU going to be an asset to this company? What problem are you going to solve and how will you solve it better than the ‘other guy’ (or gal)? If you don’t completely understand your value, you’re going to have a hard time selling yourself to the employer.”  \n\n__DON'T: Compare yourself to your others__   \n  \nCollege graduation is a unique time, because it’s likely the only time when you and all of your friends and peers are going through a job hunt at the exact same time, which can be both empowering and terrifying. “It’s easy to get stressed out when you feel like everyone is landing jobs with ease except you,” Coombs says. “But you need to remember that everyone's situation is different. People have different goals and dreams, and strengths and weaknesses. Ashley might have scored a job back in September and Katie might have just received two job offers in the past week, but their success shouldn't have a negative impact on yours. Stop worrying so much about what your peers are doing or getting and start focusing on what you’re doing in yours.”\n\n__DO: Communicate what makes you unique__  \n   \nYou don’t want to Facebook friend every potential employer, or tell them about your last party nights during senior year. But, you don’t have to wipe your resume clean of any personal information, or turn yourself into a robot in interviews, either. Don’t be afraid to include things like your interests, unique experiences, and fun facts on your resume, and in your cover letters or interviews. In fact, Kohut landed her first recruiting job after including the fact that she won a Long Island women’s ping pong tournament on her resume: The hiring manager was intrigued, and called her in for an interview. Keep in mind, Kohut says, that when you submit your resume, there’s a human being receiving it on the other end. “There’s a person there, and he or she is a person with interests as well, and if their interests match your interests, you hit a home run,” she said. “If you played tennis in college, just for fun, and that person plays tennis or…watches the U.S. Open, they’re going to want to talk to you about tennis when you get into the interview.” \n\n__DON’T: Go into an interview unprepared__   \n  \nIf you land an interview, it means you likely submitted a thoughtful, thorough application. But it doesn’t mean that it’ll be smooth sailing from there. “[Candidates] need to thoroughly prepare for interview[s] by researching the company, researching the person(s) they are meeting with, bringing enough resumes, and bringing samples of portfolio[s],” Marina Monsante, a senior recruiter with staffing agency, [Creative Circle](http://creativecircle.com/), tells *Teen Vogue.* \n\nWith the internet, you have so many resources at your fingertips that will help you walk into that interview confident and ready. “It’s so easy to be prepared these days because you can quickly go on[line] and see what people are talking about [and] what stories…are making the rounds in the industry,” Fisher says. And, “if you’re going into an interview, you should absolutely look at that person’s LinkedIn profile. You might have connections in common, you may have gone to the same school, [or] you may have volunteered for the same nonprofit. Those common points of connection…are so valuable in your conversations.” \n\n__DO: Stay in touch__   \n  \nEven if you walk out of the interview feeling like you nailed it, you need to keep working and maintain that positive momentum. Monsante recommends always getting the business cards of the people you interview with, and writing thank you notes after you leave. Reference something specific you discussed in the interview to show that you were listening and that you really care about the job. \n\nIt’s also important to stay in contact with the rest of your professional network. “Most job seekers are guilty of not keeping in touch with the people who may be able to influence their searches,” Salpeter says. If you connect with someone on LinkedIn, and then don’t reach out to that person until six months or a year later, when you’re asking for a favor, he or she may be less willing to help. You don’t have to maintain ongoing conversations with every professional contact you meet, but it’s worthwhile to occasionally send an update on what you’re doing, or post a thoughtful comment on an article they shared on LinkedIn, to remind them you’re still there and still working hard.\n\n__DON'T: Be too hard on yourself__  \n   \nJob hunting is no easy task — whether you’re doing it for the first time or the 50th. It can be a stressful and discouraging process at times, but the best thing you can do is just keep at it. And though you shouldn’t settle for a job you’ll hate, it’s okay to start with one that may be less than perfect. “Your first job probably isn’t going to be your dream job,” Coombs says. “You need to start somewhere. Fortunately, you don’t have to get married to a job for the rest of your life.” Coombs points out that millennials stay in jobs for an average of two years each. You want to stay in a job long enough to give it a shot and prove you have stick-to-itiveness, but if you don’t love it, you don’t need to be stuck forever.“Job hopping has its upsides, too, including working with a variety of people, expanding your skill sets, and figuring out where you fit in the workplace,” she says. “So, if you don’t love your first job out of college, don’t sweat it.” \n\n\n__Related:__ [10 Tips From Experts on How to Land Your Dream Internship](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/10-tips-experts-getting-internships)\n\n[#cneembed: script/playlist/541c902b69702d085b100000.js?autoplay=1&muted=1]||||||",

You want to “take it all in,” enjoy your last months on campus with your friends before “the real world” comes calling. But you also need to gear up for your post-graduation job hunt, work on your resume, and start seeking out opportunities and connections. It’s a scary thought, for sure, but it doesn’t have to be a scary process, or even one that totally consumes your final college days. These tips from career experts will help you smartly and efficiently begin your job search, and make all the right moves as you go along.

Be thoughtful about what you include on your LinkedIn profile to tell the most compelling story. Aside from simply listing internships and skills, Fisher recommends including any relevant experience you can think of (like managing the social media pages for any campus activities), and even uploading examples of your work (like major presentations you did for classes). “It’s so important to include those things, because…that real life experience can really transfer well into the professional world, but if you’re not including that in your profile, no one would ever know,” Fisher said.

[Be] very deliberate and thoughtful in terms of your approach, but not shy about asking for help.” Fisher recommends looking at your 2nd degree connections on LinkedIn — basically, people you don’t know directly but have mutual connections with. If you want to connect with someone at a specific company, and you notice that you have a shared connection with that person, don’t be afraid to reach out to that friend or acquaintance you have in common and ask for an introduction. “That is incredibly powerful and totally acceptable,” Fisher said.

If you are applying for jobs and hoping for the best, you may as well dig a hole and throw your resume inside, and place an ‘RIP’ tombstone on top.”

              <!-- react-text: 311 -->We spend so much time online these days, that we sometimes forget it is possible to do things the old fashioned way. “Another great way to get a first job is to simply put on a suit and get a leather portfolio with a bunch of resumes in it, literally walk into the door at a company or retail store, look like you’re a very professional person, and say that you want a job,” Kohut says. “They will very likely have you fill out an application on the spot and very likely hire you, because no one is doing this. Just walking in and asking for a job is not something people are doing right now, so if you do that, you stand out from the crowd for sure.”

              <!-- react-text: 316 -->And even if you do stick with the Internet, it’s still important to make meaningful connections via LinkedIn and personalized emails. “If you want a super outdated and ineffective way to apply for jobs, online job boards are your best bet,” Coombs says. “Online job openings are typically flooded with applicants, making it very hard to stand out. Moreover, your resume will likely go through an automated filtering system (called an ATS) and if it’s not an exact match, it will be tossed out before it even gets read by a human. Basically, applying online is like the

You may even be able to connect with the hiring manager in charge of that role, and skip right to the top of her list.

              <!-- react-text: 326 -->“The most successful candidates understand the connection between what they have to offer and how it relates directly to the employer’s needs,” Salpeter explains. “It’s crucial to focus on how the job seeker can help, not on what the job seeker wants in return.” When writing your cover letter, or sitting in an interview, focus less on why you need and want the job, and what you’ll get out of it personally, and more on why you’re the ideal fit for their needs.

Why are YOU going to be an asset to this company? What problem are you going to solve and how will you solve it better than the ‘other guy’ (or gal)? If you don’t completely understand your value, you’re going to have a hard time selling yourself to the employer.”

People have different goals and dreams, and strengths and weaknesses. Ashley might have scored a job back in September and Katie might have just received two job offers in the past week, but their success shouldn't have a negative impact on yours. Stop worrying so much about what your peers are doing or getting and start focusing on what you’re doing in yours.”

Don’t be afraid to include things like your interests, unique experiences, and fun facts on your resume, and in your cover letters or interviews. In fact, Kohut landed her first recruiting job after including the fact that she won a Long Island women’s ping pong tournament on her resume: The hiring manager was intrigued, and called her in for an interview. Keep in mind, Kohut says, that when you submit your resume, there’s a human being receiving it on the other end. “There’s a person there, and he or she is a person with interests as well, and if their interests match your interests, you hit a home run,” she said. “If you played tennis in college, just for fun, and that person plays tennis or…watches the U.S. Open, they’re going to want to talk to you about tennis when you get into the interview.”

              <!-- react-text: 350 -->With the internet, you have so many resources at your fingertips that will help you walk into that interview confident and ready. “It’s so easy to be prepared these days because you can quickly go on[line] and see what people are talking about [and] what stories…are making the rounds in the industry,” Fisher says. And, “if you’re going into an interview, you should absolutely look at that person’s LinkedIn profile. You might have connections in common, you may have gone to the same school, [or] you may have volunteered for the same nonprofit. Those common points of connection…are so valuable in your conversations.”

              <!-- react-text: 355 -->Even if you walk out of the interview feeling like you nailed it, you need to keep working and maintain that positive momentum. Monsante recommends always getting the business cards of the people you interview with, and writing thank you notes after you leave. Reference something specific you discussed in the interview to show that you were listening and that you really care about the job.

              <!-- react-text: 357 -->It’s also important to stay in contact with the rest of your professional network. “Most job seekers are guilty of not keeping in touch with the people who may be able to influence their searches,” Salpeter says. If you connect with someone on LinkedIn, and then don’t reach out to that person until six months or a year later, when you’re asking for a favor, he or she may be less willing to help. You don’t have to maintain ongoing conversations with every professional contact you meet, but it’s worthwhile to occasionally send an update on what you’re doing, or post a thoughtful comment on an article they shared on LinkedIn, to remind them you’re still there and still working hard.

              <!-- react-text: 362 -->Job hunting is no easy task — whether you’re doing it for the first time or the 50th. It can be a stressful and discouraging process at times, but the best thing you can do is just keep at it. And though you shouldn’t settle for a job you’ll hate, it’s okay to start with one that may be less than perfect. “Your first job probably isn’t going to be your dream job,” Coombs says. “You need to start somewhere. Fortunately, you don’t have to get married to a job for the rest of your life.” Coombs points out that millennials stay in jobs for an average of two years each. You want to stay in a job long enough to give it a shot and prove you have stick-to-itiveness, but if you don’t love it, you don’t need to be stuck forever.“Job hopping has its upsides, too, including working with a variety of people, expanding your skill sets, and figuring out where you fit in the workplace,” she says. “So, if you don’t love your first job out of college, don’t sweat it.”

You want to “take it all in,” enjoy your last months on campus with your friends before “the real world” comes calling. But you also need to gear up for your post-graduation job hunt, work on your resume, and start seeking out opportunities and connections. It’s a scary thought, for sure, but it doesn’t have to be a scary process, or even one that totally consumes your final college days. These tips from career experts will help you smartly and efficiently begin your job search, and make all the right moves as you go along."],["p",["strong","DO: Utilize LinkedIn"]],["p","LinkedIn is a community completely dedicated to professional networking, and its benefits for any job-searchers are practically endless. Create a profile, and you can easily connect with people you meet, gather information about companies, industries, and potential employers, and follow ",["a",{"href":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/discover"},"LinkedIn Influencers"]," for valuable tips and knowledge. And of course, aside from helping you build your network, LinkedIn serves as a digital resume and portfolio that anyone in a hiring position can — and likely will — view, which is why LinkedIn career expert, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherinefisherlinkedin"},"Catherine Fisher"],", tells ",["em","Teen Vogue"]," it’s crucial for recent grads to have a presence on the site. “It’s incredibly important [for recent grads] to show up professionally and be where those recruiters and hiring managers are,” she said. Be thoughtful about what you include on your LinkedIn profile to tell the most compelling story. Aside from simply listing internships and skills, Fisher recommends including any relevant experience you can think of (like managing the social media pages for any campus activities), and even uploading examples of your work (like major presentations you did for classes). “It’s so important to include those things, because…that real life experience can really transfer well into the professional world, but if you’re not including that in your profile, no one would ever know,” Fisher said."],["p",["strong","DON’T: Assume your social media is private"]],["p","In a perfect world, your online presence would be as private as you want it to be, but it’s not a perfect world, and even when you think your social media accounts are only for your eyes, chances are, they’re vulnerable to strangers’ views, too. “You have to assume that everybody is reading [your social media posts],” Abby Kohut, a recruiter and career consultant at ",["a",{"href":"http://absolutelyabby.com/"},"AbsolutelyAbby.com"],", tells ",["em","Teen Vogue."]," “People are posting pictures of themselves drinking at parties, and that’s not going to work. If you post those pictures, employers are not going to hire you. They’re also putting up curse words…and talking in slang…and employers are seeing those things, and they’re making judgments about you, and you don’t want them to do that.” If you’re not sure whether or not something is appropriate to share on social media, follow Kohut’s advice: “Don’t ever put anything on any of these sites that you wouldn’t want your parents, your pastor, or your new boss to see.”"],["p",["strong","DO: Put yourself out there"]],["p","Networking is crucial to landing any job, and though it can be scary to put yourself out there, reach out to people you don’t know, and ask for help, it can be wildly beneficial. “Any time you meet someone you think could help you with your professional journey, connect with them on LinkedIn,” Fisher said. “Most people want to help you. [Be] very deliberate and thoughtful in terms of your approach, but not shy about asking for help.” Fisher recommends looking at your 2nd degree connections on LinkedIn — basically, people you don’t know directly but have mutual connections with. If you want to connect with someone at a specific company, and you notice that you have a shared connection with that person, don’t be afraid to reach out to that friend or acquaintance you have in common and ask for an introduction. “That is incredibly powerful and totally acceptable,” Fisher said."],["p","The good news: You likely already have some networking skills in your back pocket. “You don’t have to be super outgoing to network effectively,” Ariella Coombs, a millennial career coach and contributor to sites like ",["a",{"href":"http://www.careerealism.com/author/ariella/"},"Careerealism"]," and ",["a",{"href":"http://careerhmo.com/"},"CareerHMO"]," tells ",["em","Teen Vogue."]," “You and I both grew up with the Internet. Chatting online comes easy to us. So, start with what comes easy to you. Look at your list of target companies, then go on LinkedIn and invite them to connect. Then, shoot them a message and ",["a",{"href":"http://careerhmo.com/start-conversation-linkedin-connection/"},"start a dialog"],".”"],["p","You should also try to utilize alumni lists from your schools and even try reaching out to your parents' friends who may be involved in an industry you find interesting."],["p",["strong","DON’T: Wait until you graduate to get started"]],["p","“Believe me, I know it’s tempting to put off your job search until after graduation so you can enjoy every last bit of your college glory days,” Coombs says. “However, it’s probably not in your best interest to hold off. It can take months for you to get a job. Moreover, the longer you’re out of work, the less desirable you become to employers. So, don’t put it off!”"],["p","Starting early doesn’t necessarily mean applying to jobs before you even take your first senior year class, though. It’s also very much about building your network while you’re still in college, so that by the time you do start seriously searching, you’ll have plenty of connections and resources to work with."],["p",["strong","DO: Ask for recommendations"]],["p","Rather than wait until a potential employer asks you for references, be proactive and ask for recommendations that you can include on your resume from the start. A professor who can vouch for your character, work ethic, and critical thinking skills, for example, can be priceless when you're trying to land your first job. While a glowing recommendation from anyone is great, Fisher recommends you consider people you’ve encountered — professors, mentors, coaches, or internship bosses — who have a direct connection to your desired industry for the most powerful effect."],["p",["strong","DON’T: Apply for anything and everything"]],["p","Sure, when you’re applying to jobs, you want to give yourself options — but that doesn’t mean submitting your resume to every semi-relevant job you find. “Do not blanket your resume to hundreds of organizations, and don’t apply for every entry-level opening at a company,” Miriam Salpeter, owner of ",["a",{"href":"http://www.keppiecareers.com/"},"Keppie Careers"],", tells ",["em","Teen Vogue."]," “It makes you look unfocused.” Coombs recommends making a list of the top 10 companies you’d like to work for, and start from there."],["p","And once you do start applying, be sure to tailor each application — and the resume you send with it — to the specific company and job you’re applying for. “It’s best to spend time on each application and be careful to avoid mistakes, such as sending a cover letter meant for one company to another organization,” Salpeter says. “[Identify] and [include] targeted keywords in your resume and online materials. If you are applying for jobs and hoping for the best, you may as well dig a hole and throw your resume inside, and place an ‘RIP’ tombstone on top.”"],["p",["strong","DO: Think outside the computer"]],["p","We spend so much time online these days, that we sometimes forget it is possible to do things the old fashioned way. “Another great way to get a first job is to simply put on a suit and get a leather portfolio with a bunch of resumes in it, literally walk into the door at a company or retail store, look like you’re a very professional person, and say that you want a job,” Kohut says. “They will very likely have you fill out an application on the spot and very likely hire you, because no one is doing this. Just walking in and asking for a job is not something people are doing right now, so if you do that, you stand out from the crowd for sure.”"],["p",["strong","DON’T: Rely on online job boards"]],["p","And even if you do stick with the Internet, it’s still important to make meaningful connections via LinkedIn and personalized emails. “If you want a super outdated and ineffective way to apply for jobs, online job boards are your best bet,” Coombs says. “Online job openings are typically flooded with applicants, making it very hard to stand out. Moreover, your resume will likely go through an automated filtering system (called an ATS) and if it’s not an exact match, it will be tossed out before it even gets read by a human. Basically, applying online is like the ",["em","Hunger Games"]," of job search. May the odds be ever in your favor…”"],["p","There’s nothing wrong with finding leads and information from online job boards, but once you see something that interests you, research a different way you can get in: Look on LinkedIn for people at that company with whom you may have mutual connections, or call the human resources department directly and ask for more information on what they’re looking for. You may even be able to connect with the hiring manager in charge of that role, and skip right to the top of her list."],["p",["strong","DO: Know — and communicate — what you bring to the table"]],["p","“The most successful candidates understand the connection between what they have to offer and how it relates directly to the employer’s needs,” Salpeter explains. “It’s crucial to focus on how the job seeker can help, not on what the job seeker wants in return.” When writing your cover letter, or sitting in an interview, focus less on why you need and want the job, and what you’ll get out of it personally, and more on why you’re the ideal fit for their needs."],["p","If you’re not sure what that is, take some time to figure it out before you start applying. “In order for a company to offer you a seat, the employer needs to know what you bring to the table,” Coombs says. “That means you need to have a clear idea of what you offer in terms of value. Why are YOU going to be an asset to this company? What problem are you going to solve and how will you solve it better than the ‘other guy’ (or gal)? If you don’t completely understand your value, you’re going to have a hard time selling yourself to the employer.”"],["p",["strong","DON'T: Compare yourself to your others"]],["p","College graduation is a unique time, because it’s likely the only time when you and all of your friends and peers are going through a job hunt at the exact same time, which can be both empowering and terrifying. “It’s easy to get stressed out when you feel like everyone is landing jobs with ease except you,” Coombs says. “But you need to remember that everyone's situation is different. People have different goals and dreams, and strengths and weaknesses. Ashley might have scored a job back in September and Katie might have just received two job offers in the past week, but their success shouldn't have a negative impact on yours. Stop worrying so much about what your peers are doing or getting and start focusing on what you’re doing in yours.”"],["p",["strong","DO: Communicate what makes you unique"]],["p","You don’t want to Facebook friend every potential employer, or tell them about your last party nights during senior year. But, you don’t have to wipe your resume clean of any personal information, or turn yourself into a robot in interviews, either. Don’t be afraid to include things like your interests, unique experiences, and fun facts on your resume, and in your cover letters or interviews. In fact, Kohut landed her first recruiting job after including the fact that she won a Long Island women’s ping pong tournament on her resume: The hiring manager was intrigued, and called her in for an interview. Keep in mind, Kohut says, that when you submit your resume, there’s a human being receiving it on the other end. “There’s a person there, and he or she is a person with interests as well, and if their interests match your interests, you hit a home run,” she said. “If you played tennis in college, just for fun, and that person plays tennis or…watches the U.S. Open, they’re going to want to talk to you about tennis when you get into the interview.”"],["p",["strong","DON’T: Go into an interview unprepared"]],["p","If you land an interview, it means you likely submitted a thoughtful, thorough application. But it doesn’t mean that it’ll be smooth sailing from there. “[Candidates] need to thoroughly prepare for interview[s] by researching the company, researching the person(s) they are meeting with, bringing enough resumes, and bringing samples of portfolio[s],” Marina Monsante, a senior recruiter with staffing agency, ",["a",{"href":"http://creativecircle.com/"},"Creative Circle"],", tells ",["em","Teen Vogue."]],["p","With the internet, you have so many resources at your fingertips that will help you walk into that interview confident and ready. “It’s so easy to be prepared these days because you can quickly go on[line] and see what people are talking about [and] what stories…are making the rounds in the industry,” Fisher says. And, “if you’re going into an interview, you should absolutely look at that person’s LinkedIn profile. You might have connections in common, you may have gone to the same school, [or] you may have volunteered for the same nonprofit. Those common points of connection…are so valuable in your conversations.”"],["p",["strong","DO: Stay in touch"]],["p","Even if you walk out of the interview feeling like you nailed it, you need to keep working and maintain that positive momentum. Monsante recommends always getting the business cards of the people you interview with, and writing thank you notes after you leave. Reference something specific you discussed in the interview to show that you were listening and that you really care about the job."],["p","It’s also important to stay in contact with the rest of your professional network. “Most job seekers are guilty of not keeping in touch with the people who may be able to influence their searches,” Salpeter says. If you connect with someone on LinkedIn, and then don’t reach out to that person until six months or a year later, when you’re asking for a favor, he or she may be less willing to help. You don’t have to maintain ongoing conversations with every professional contact you meet, but it’s worthwhile to occasionally send an update on what you’re doing, or post a thoughtful comment on an article they shared on LinkedIn, to remind them you’re still there and still working hard."],["p",["strong","DON'T: Be too hard on yourself"]],["p","Job hunting is no easy task — whether you’re doing it for the first time or the 50th. It can be a stressful and discouraging process at times, but the best thing you can do is just keep at it. And though you shouldn’t settle for a job you’ll hate, it’s okay to start with one that may be less than perfect. “Your first job probably isn’t going to be your dream job,” Coombs says. “You need to start somewhere. Fortunately, you don’t have to get married to a job for the rest of your life.” Coombs points out that millennials stay in jobs for an average of two years each. You want to stay in a job long enough to give it a shot and prove you have stick-to-itiveness, but if you don’t love it, you don’t need to be stuck forever.“Job hopping has its upsides, too, including working with a variety of people, expanding your skill sets, and figuring out where you fit in the workplace,” she says. “So, if you don’t love your first job out of college, don’t sweat it.”"],["p",["strong","Related:"]," ",["a",{"href":"http://www.teenvogue.com/story/10-tips-experts-getting-internships"},"10 Tips From Experts on How to Land Your Dream Internship"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"cneembed","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cneembed%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22script%2Fplaylist%2F541c902b69702d085b100000.js%3Fautoplay%3D1%26muted%3D1%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]],"categories":{},"channel":"My Life","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5582823ea28d9d4e0540a485","modelName":"contributor","bio":"__What beauty product are you loving right now?__ YSL's Glossy Lip Stain.

It's a splurge, but worth it for how long it lasts, without drying out my lips. I rarely remember to re-apply throughout the day or night, so a good lip stain is crucial in my book. \n\n__What’s your go-to karaoke song?__ That's a toss up between Salt-N-Pepa's \"Shoop\" and 4 Non Blonde's \"What's Up.\" They're both 90s classics; it just depends whether I'm in the mood to show off my rapping skills or channel my inner angsty diva. \n\n__If you had to describe yourself in a GIF, what would it be?__ This [dancing cat](http://giphy.com/gifs/cat-funny-uU3oBlPJTx184) is my spirit animal.\n\n__What fashion item seems to always be on your shopping list?__ Sunglasses. My collection is already absurdly large, but I can't get enough. As far as I'm concerned, they're the ultimate accessory, regardless of the time of year.\n\n__Share a funny anecdote from a first job or internship.__ During my first internship in New York City, my fellow intern and I interviewed the cast of the TV show, *Degrassi: The Next Generation*, including one up-and-coming star, known then as Aubrey Graham. After the interview, feeling like we \"really connected\" with Aubrey, my co-intern and I sent him Facebook friend requests. 9 years later, he still hasn't accepted, but he's been pretty busy, launching a rap career and all. Drake, if you're reading this, my offer still stands!

tricky. You want to “take it all in,” enjoy your last months on campus with your friends before “the real world” comes calling. But you also need to gear up for your post-graduation job hunt, work on your resume, and start seeking out opportunities and connections. It’s a scary thought, for sure, but it doesn’t have to be a scary process, or even one that totally consumes your final college days. These tips from career experts will help you smartly and efficiently begin your job search, and make all the right moves as you go along. \n\n__DO: Utilize LinkedIn__   \n\nLinkedIn is a community completely dedicated to professional networking, and its benefits for any job-searchers are practically endless. Create a profile, and you can easily connect with people you meet, gather information about companies, industries, and potential employers, and follow [LinkedIn Influencers](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/discover) for valuable tips and knowledge. And of course, aside from helping you build your network, LinkedIn serves as a digital resume and portfolio that anyone in a hiring position can — and likely will — view, which is why LinkedIn career expert, [Catherine Fisher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherinefisherlinkedin), tells *Teen Vogue* it’s crucial for recent grads to have a presence on the site. “It’s incredibly important [for recent grads] to show up professionally and be where those recruiters and hiring managers are,” she said. Be thoughtful about what you include on your LinkedIn profile to tell the most compelling story. Aside from simply listing internships and skills, Fisher recommends including any relevant experience you can think of (like managing the social media pages for any campus activities), and even uploading examples of your work (like major presentations you did for classes). “It’s so important to include those things, because…that real life experience can really transfer well into the professional world, but if you’re not including that in your profile, no one would ever know,” Fisher said. \n\n__DON’T: Assume your social media is private__   \n\nIn a perfect world, your online presence would be as private as you want it to be, but it’s not a perfect world, and even when you think your social media accounts are only for your eyes, chances are, they’re vulnerable to strangers’ views, too. “You have to assume that everybody is reading [your social media posts],” Abby Kohut, a recruiter and career consultant at [AbsolutelyAbby.com](http://absolutelyabby.com/), tells *Teen Vogue.* “People are posting pictures of themselves drinking at parties, and that’s not going to work. If you post those pictures, employers are not going to hire you. They’re also putting up curse words…and talking in slang…and employers are seeing those things, and they’re making judgments about you, and you don’t want them to do that.” If you’re not sure whether or not something is appropriate to share on social media, follow Kohut’s advice: “Don’t ever put anything on any of these sites that you wouldn’t want your parents, your pastor, or your new boss to see.” \n\n__DO: Put yourself out there__     \n\nNetworking is crucial to landing any job, and though it can be scary to put yourself out there, reach out to people you don’t know, and ask for help, it can be wildly beneficial. “Any time you meet someone you think could help you with your professional journey, connect with them on LinkedIn,” Fisher said. “Most people want to help you. [Be] very deliberate and thoughtful in terms of your approach, but not shy about asking for help.” Fisher recommends looking at your 2nd degree connections on LinkedIn — basically, people you don’t know directly but have mutual connections with. If you want to connect with someone at a specific company, and you notice that you have a shared connection with that person, don’t be afraid to reach out to that friend or acquaintance you have in common and ask for an introduction. “That is incredibly powerful and totally acceptable,” Fisher said. \n\nThe good news: You likely already have some networking skills in your back pocket. “You don’t have to be super outgoing to network effectively,” Ariella Coombs, a millennial career coach and contributor to sites like [Careerealism](http://www.careerealism.com/author/ariella/) and [CareerHMO](http://careerhmo.com/) tells *Teen Vogue.* “You and I both grew up with the Internet. Chatting online comes easy to us. So, start with what comes easy to you. Look at your list of target companies, then go on LinkedIn and invite them to connect. Then, shoot them a message and [start a dialog](http://careerhmo.com/start-conversation-linkedin-connection/).” \n\nYou should also try to utilize alumni lists from your schools and even try reaching out to your parents' friends who may be involved in an industry you find interesting. \n\n__DON’T: Wait until you graduate to get started__  \n   \n“Believe me, I know it’s tempting to put off your job search until after graduation so you can enjoy every last bit of your college glory days,” Coombs says. “However, it’s probably not in your best interest to hold off. It can take months for you to get a job. Moreover, the longer you’re out of work, the less desirable you become to employers. So, don’t put it off!” \n\nStarting early doesn’t necessarily mean applying to jobs before you even take your first senior year class, though. It’s also very much about building your network while you’re still in college, so that by the time you do start seriously searching, you’ll have plenty of connections and resources to work with. \n\n__DO: Ask for recommendations__   \n  \nRather than wait until a potential employer asks you for references, be proactive and ask for recommendations that you can include on your resume from the start. A professor who can vouch for your character, work ethic, and critical thinking skills, for example, can be priceless when you're trying to land your first job. While a glowing recommendation from anyone is great, Fisher recommends you consider people you’ve encountered — professors, mentors, coaches, or internship bosses — who have a direct connection to your desired industry for the most powerful effect.  \n\n__DON’T: Apply for anything and everything__     \n\nSure, when you’re applying to jobs, you want to give yourself options — but that doesn’t mean submitting your resume to every semi-relevant job you find. “Do not blanket your resume to hundreds of organizations, and don’t apply for every entry-level opening at a company,” Miriam Salpeter, owner of [Keppie Careers](http://www.keppiecareers.com/), tells *Teen Vogue.* “It makes you look unfocused.” Coombs recommends making a list of the top 10 companies you’d like to work for, and start from there.     \n\nAnd once you do start applying, be sure to tailor each application — and the resume you send with it — to the specific company and job you’re applying for. “It’s best to spend time on each application and be careful to avoid mistakes, such as sending a cover letter meant for one company to another organization,” Salpeter says. “[Identify] and [include] targeted keywords in your resume and online materials. If you are applying for jobs and hoping for the best, you may as well dig a hole and throw your resume inside, and place an ‘RIP’ tombstone on top.” \n\n__DO: Think outside the computer__  \n   \nWe spend so much time online these days, that we sometimes forget it is possible to do things the old fashioned way. “Another great way to get a first job is to simply put on a suit and get a leather portfolio with a bunch of resumes in it, literally walk into the door at a company or retail store, look like you’re a very professional person, and say that you want a job,” Kohut says. “They will very likely have you fill out an application on the spot and very likely hire you, because no one is doing this. Just walking in and asking for a job is not something people are doing right now, so if you do that, you stand out from the crowd for sure.” \n\n__DON’T: Rely on online job boards__  \n   \nAnd even if you do stick with the Internet, it’s still important to make meaningful connections via LinkedIn and personalized emails. “If you want a super outdated and ineffective way to apply for jobs, online job boards are your best bet,” Coombs says. “Online job openings are typically flooded with applicants, making it very hard to stand out. Moreover, your resume will likely go through an automated filtering system (called an ATS) and if it’s not an exact match, it will be tossed out before it even gets read by a human. Basically, applying online is like the *Hunger Games* of job search. May the odds be ever in your favor…” \n\nThere’s nothing wrong with finding leads and information from online job boards, but once you see something that interests you, research a different way you can get in: Look on LinkedIn for people at that company with whom you may have mutual connections, or call the human resources department directly and ask for more information on what they’re looking for. You may even be able to connect with the hiring manager in charge of that role, and skip right to the top of her list. \n\n__DO: Know — and communicate — what you bring to the table__  \n   \n“The most successful candidates understand the connection between what they have to offer and how it relates directly to the employer’s needs,” Salpeter explains. “It’s crucial to focus on how the job seeker can help, not on what the job seeker wants in return.” When writing your cover letter, or sitting in an interview, focus less on why you need and want the job, and what you’ll get out of it personally, and more on why you’re the ideal fit for their needs.  \n\nIf you’re not sure what that is, take some time to figure it out before you start applying. “In order for a company to offer you a seat, the employer needs to know what you bring to the table,” Coombs says. “That means you need to have a clear idea of what you offer in terms of value. Why are YOU going to be an asset to this company? What problem are you going to solve and how will you solve it better than the ‘other guy’ (or gal)? If you don’t completely understand your value, you’re going to have a hard time selling yourself to the employer.”  \n\n__DON'T: Compare yourself to your others__   \n  \nCollege graduation is a unique time, because it’s likely the only time when you and all of your friends and peers are going through a job hunt at the exact same time, which can be both empowering and terrifying. “It’s easy to get stressed out when you feel like everyone is landing jobs with ease except you,” Coombs says. “But you need to remember that everyone's situation is different. People have different goals and dreams, and strengths and weaknesses. Ashley might have scored a job back in September and Katie might have just received two job offers in the past week, but their success shouldn't have a negative impact on yours. Stop worrying so much about what your peers are doing or getting and start focusing on what you’re doing in yours.”\n\n__DO: Communicate what makes you unique__  \n   \nYou don’t want to Facebook friend every potential employer, or tell them about your last party nights during senior year. But, you don’t have to wipe your resume clean of any personal information, or turn yourself into a robot in interviews, either. Don’t be afraid to include things like your interests, unique experiences, and fun facts on your resume, and in your cover letters or interviews. In fact, Kohut landed her first recruiting job after including the fact that she won a Long Island women’s ping pong tournament on her resume: The hiring manager was intrigued, and called her in for an interview. Keep in mind, Kohut says, that when you submit your resume, there’s a human being receiving it on the other end. “There’s a person there, and he or she is a person with interests as well, and if their interests match your interests, you hit a home run,” she said. “If you played tennis in college, just for fun, and that person plays tennis or…watches the U.S. Open, they’re going to want to talk to you about tennis when you get into the interview.” \n\n__DON’T: Go into an interview unprepared__   \n  \nIf you land an interview, it means you likely submitted a thoughtful, thorough application. But it doesn’t mean that it’ll be smooth sailing from there. “[Candidates] need to thoroughly prepare for interview[s] by researching the company, researching the person(s) they are meeting with, bringing enough resumes, and bringing samples of portfolio[s],” Marina Monsante, a senior recruiter with staffing agency, [Creative Circle](http://creativecircle.com/), tells *Teen Vogue.* \n\nWith the internet, you have so many resources at your fingertips that will help you walk into that interview confident and ready. “It’s so easy to be prepared these days because you can quickly go on[line] and see what people are talking about [and] what stories…are making the rounds in the industry,” Fisher says. And, “if you’re going into an interview, you should absolutely look at that person’s LinkedIn profile. You might have connections in common, you may have gone to the same school, [or] you may have volunteered for the same nonprofit. Those common points of connection…are so valuable in your conversations.” \n\n__DO: Stay in touch__   \n  \nEven if you walk out of the interview feeling like you nailed it, you need to keep working and maintain that positive momentum. Monsante recommends always getting the business cards of the people you interview with, and writing thank you notes after you leave. Reference something specific you discussed in the interview to show that you were listening and that you really care about the job. \n\nIt’s also important to stay in contact with the rest of your professional network. “Most job seekers are guilty of not keeping in touch with the people who may be able to influence their searches,” Salpeter says. If you connect with someone on LinkedIn, and then don’t reach out to that person until six months or a year later, when you’re asking for a favor, he or she may be less willing to help. You don’t have to maintain ongoing conversations with every professional contact you meet, but it’s worthwhile to occasionally send an update on what you’re doing, or post a thoughtful comment on an article they shared on LinkedIn, to remind them you’re still there and still working hard.\n\n__DON'T: Be too hard on yourself__  \n   \nJob hunting is no easy task — whether you’re doing it for the first time or the 50th. It can be a stressful and discouraging process at times, but the best thing you can do is just keep at it. And though you shouldn’t settle for a job you’ll hate, it’s okay to start with one that may be less than perfect. “Your first job probably isn’t going to be your dream job,” Coombs says. “You need to start somewhere. Fortunately, you don’t have to get married to a job for the rest of your life.” Coombs points out that millennials stay in jobs for an average of two years each. You want to stay in a job long enough to give it a shot and prove you have stick-to-itiveness, but if you don’t love it, you don’t need to be stuck forever.“Job hopping has its upsides, too, including working with a variety of people, expanding your skill sets, and figuring out where you fit in the workplace,” she says. “So, if you don’t love your first job out of college, don’t sweat it.”
