Are pain letters on the way out? A pain letter is a different approach to a cover letter that addresses the employer’s pain point and outlines how the applicant can solve it.

"description":"Dawn Rasmussen, President of Pathfinder Careers shares her contribution to Land Your Dream Job Anywhere.\n How effective is networking? If you apply for a job online you have a 2% chance of getting an interview. If you apply through someone you know you have a 50% chance of getting an interview. Direct networking is that impactful.\n Are you thinking, “but I’m not a type ‘A’ networker. How do I practice?\" You should be proactive and put yourself out there by:\n  Growing an informal connection with someone through continued follow-up. Taking the fear out of talking with unknown people by making them a known quantity. Getting involved or volunteering with a business or organization that interests you.

"description":"If you're considering a career change, play to your strengths. Highlight what you’re already good at - those skills that will help you contribute right away - and show people that you’re willing to learn the rest! Guest expert Danna Redmond encourages career changers to create a plan, but also be open to opportunities that come up naturally over time. It’s important to be ready to go into something new without every step clearly outlined.\n Start with a couple best practices:\n  Network! Let people know you’re interested in a new career path, and ask questions. Assess your skillset. Don’t pigeonhole yourself into your existing area of expertise. Think about the skills that make you an expert, and ask how you can apply those in other areas.  Our Guest for This Episode: Danna Redmond Danna Redmond is hosts the podcast, The Career Cue. She has a passion for helping people turn career goals and dreams into reality. Danna is an accomplished business leader.

I think that's one of the biggest challenges. It's actually the ONE thing that prevents me from switching careers in hopes of finding work I enjoy.”\n These segments are sponsored by Mac’s new book, Land Your Dream Job Anywhere.

If there’s something you’ve always dreamed of doing, decide to take it seriously. Try it on. Try out your dream, talk to people who have done it, and get past the fantasy. Create it smart. This process takes time. Don’t rush. Have a plan, then hold yourself accountable.

"description":"Losing a job is tough; getting laid off unexpectedly is even harder. It's emotionally devastating when all of the sudden you lose your job, your paycheck, and the vision you had of yourself, all in one fell swoop.\n Career coach and guest expert, Sherri Thomas, shares her tips on how to bounce back from such professional setbacks. She recommends:\n  Take some time to heal. Process and quiet the negative chatter in your brain before looking for a new job.

Try writing down what you and your previous manager could have done better. This exercise may highlight opportunities for professional growth. Emphasize the positives. If you are wondering how you should address your departure in conversations, Sherri recommends this recipe: share something you are grateful for from your last position, talk about an impact you made at the organization in quantifiable terms, and then own your story and relay it in a positive way.

"description":"Your resume is probably the most important document you use when looking for a job. It offers a great opportunity to tell your story and demonstrate what you can offer an employer.\n Guest expert Jacqui Barrett-Poindexter shares her top 6 list of what’s hot and what’s not in creating a great resume for today’s job market.\n What’s Hot in Resumes  Focus — Make your resume format quick and easy to read and keep it employer focused. What's in it for the Employer — Research pain points the employer has and integrate your strategic insights about the issue.

What’s Not - And How to Fix It  Brain Dump — Unless it directly benefits the employer, leave out the wordy details.

Followership — Demonstrate your ability to take on the role of a leader when necessary. One and Done — It’s important to have multiple ways an employer can access desired information about your career.

"description":"Informational interviews are a fairly recent strategy in the search for a new career. The application process and job searches of the past were more formal endeavors. As a job seeker, this new adaptation gives you more networking opportunities than were available before.\n Consider your existing network and divide it into two categories:\n  Your strong ties — People you immediately think of as business connections. Your weak ties — People who are separated from you by a few degrees. Friends of friends, for example, can become a great career resource.  When working to build your network, guest expert Kate Gremillion recommends asking your strong ties this question: “Knowing my interests and knowing what I want to be doing in my career, who would you suggest I speak with?” She says people genuinely enjoy helping other people, so this is a great place to start.\n Checking LinkedIn connections of people who have influence at a company you want to work for is another great tip. These “weak” ties can turn into strong connections if you approach them in a professional manner.\n Once you’ve landed an informational interview with a contact it’s important to:\n  Allow the other person to chose the method of communication. Prepare 3-5 actions the person could do to help you if they ask. Take a genuine interest in the other person by listening more and talking less.  This Week’s Guest: Kate Gremillion Kate Gremillion is Founder & CEO of Mavenly + Co.  Her firm offers group workshops, corporate training courses, and coaching programs. These services give young women the tools, resources and mindset they need to create careers and lifestyles with purpose.\n Kate also hosts the weekly podcast, Women, Work, and Worth.

She says most companies love being approached directly by people who tell them why their skills are a good fit for the organization.\n Companies benefit from your direct approach by saving recruiter fees and seeing your proactive interest.\n 5 Steps to Take Control of a Job Search\n  Create a LinkedIn profile that includes your skills and recommendations from your peers. Proactively search for companies in your area that may have a role that fits your specialty. Look beyond recruiters and include department heads or hiring managers. Thoroughly research the company before you reach out to them. Call instead of email, follow up, and make the conversation about the company, not about you.  Good old-fashioned networking may be what it takes for you to find your next job, and don’t forget networking includes social networking. Reach out to recruiters on Twitter and start a “get to know you” conversation.\n Katrina Collier Bio\n Katrina Collier is a global expert on social recruiting. She teaches people at corporations around the world how to use social media to recruit staff.\n Katrina is also a keynote speaker and the host of  The Social Recruiting Show. You can find out more about Katrina at The Searchologist and follow her on Twitter @KatrinaMCollier.\n Katrina will be exercising her public speaking skills in the U.S. and London, training recruiters about candidate engagement.\n Ben’s Job Search Resource: LinkedIn for Veterans \n Ben’s resource this week is from  LinkedIn for Good Veterans Program and families of veterans.

"description":"If you are an older job seeker, you have probably wondered if your age has been a factor in not getting an interview or a job offer for a position you wanted.\n\nAgeism is a very real thing, but not every rejection is due to age discrimination. Guest Jacob Share says being the right cultural fit for a position is the most important factor in your being invited into an organization. People want to hire people they will enjoy being around on a day-to-day basis.\n\nIf you are finding it difficult to get an interview, Jacob recommends using LinkedIn as a tool to find other people who have similar characteristics and experience. Observe which companies have hired them and reach out to current and past employees. Ask for a copy of their resume so you know exactly what type of information the company is looking for. Many positions in today’s job market are filled by personal or professional referrals, so networking can be an important aspect of your job search.\n\nWe discussed tactics you can try to squash common concerns a company may have about your age:\n  Your experience may merit a higher salary than the company has budgeted for.   During the interview, state how your experience can add up to cost savings in other areas.   They may be looking for a long-term employee and think you could retire soon.   Make it known you intend to grow with the company and describe your loyalty to previous companies.   You may not be able to work for someone younger than you.   Cite examples of how you are already working with younger people.    This Week’s Guest: Jacob Share Jacob Share is the founder of JobMob, an award-winning blog that serves a global audience.

"description":"If you’re ready to find a new job but want to stay in your current company while you look for a better opportunity, you need to engage in a thoughtful and sensitive “stealth” job search. You don’t want your boss finding out that you’ve already got one foot out the door!\n Recruiter, Bernie Reifkind, reminds job seekers to “trust no one” with their plan to seek employment elsewhere. Even co-workers who have become close friends should not know about your plans. If the information were to slip out, you could be terminated from your current position.\n If you are networking as part of your job search (and you should be!) Bernie recommends using certain phrases which subtly imply you are in the market for new opportunities. He also recommends asking others to respect your confidentiality.\n A confidential candidate resume is one way to send your resume to respective employers while keeping your personal data hidden. Make sure your resume is world-class, then replace your name with “Confidential Candidate,” set up a new email account and remove any and all personal information.\n During a stealth job search:\n  Lock down your LinkedIn with privacy options. Keep your activities private from your current colleagues. Never use a company computer to search. Be cautious about responding to blind job postings.

"description":"As a job seeker, you need both a resume and a LinkedIn profile. These two documents shouldn’t be mirror images of each other. Each has their own particular purpose and, together, they function as a complimentary review of your work history.\n\nYour LinkedIn profile is a broad overview of what your professional value proposition is. Your resume should be customized around particular job opportunity. It’s important to use keywords from the job posting in your resume so when the hiring manager knows you are familiar with the language and the culture of the opportunity.\n Our guest expert this week is recruiter and career coach, \u2028Ed Han. Ed says you need to be consistent when talking about yourself online and in your resume, but that you need to customize each piece.\n Here are two areas where your resume and LinkedIn profiles should differ:\n  Keywords: On LinkedIn, you should use industry-specific keywords. (What search terms would an average recruiter or hiring manager be searching for when they’re looking for someone with your skills. In your resume, mimic the keywords and language found in the job description. (The terms that are most likely to get you past the company’s applicant tracking system.)   Accomplishments: In LinkedIn, you should list your biggest accomplishments in the summary section or headline, as these are the most commonly read parts of your profile. On your resume, each accomplishment should be associated with the relevant job. \n  Ed also recommends having a master resume with a complete inventory of your work, educational experience, and accomplishments. It makes customizing a resume for a specific opportunity easier, and you can see all of your amazing accomplishments at a glance.\n This Week’s Guest: Ed Han\n Ed Han is a recruiter with a passion for networking and helping people put their professional best foot forward, especially on LinkedIn. His own career includes stints with a major Wall Street firm, an international fashion brand, and a publishing company.

"description":"It’s the first question in a majority of all interviews: “Tell me about yourself.” While it seems like a simple prompt, it can make or break the rest of your interview. Mess it up and you’ve ruined your first impression with the employer. Ace the question and you’ll set the tone for the rest of the meeting.\n The question is so important that job coach, Katherine Burik, has written an entire book on how to craft a winning answer. Katherine shares the “Cliffs Notes” version of her strategy this week on the podcast.  \n The foundation of Katherine strategy is to is to plan ahead. Think about what the interviewer wants to hear, and share ideas and experiences that speak to their needs. You’ve got to be honest, but you can shape your experience in a way that will resonate with the employer.\n To ace the “Tell me about yourself” interview question, Katherine offers a five step approach:\n  Provide a short, high-level overview about yourself. Highlight a specific accomplishment you are proud of--preferably one that is related to the position to which you are currently applying. Share five flattering (but honest) words to describe yourself, starting with “I am…” Explain why you are interested in this specific position. Tell the interviewer why they should hire you.  The trick is to communicate everything above in a concise and direct way. Your entire answer shouldn’t take more than two minutes. The best way to ensure you have a tight, well-tuned response is to practice, practice, practice!\n This Week’s Guest: Katherine Burik\n Katherine Burik is a partner at The Interview Doctor. She works with both job candidates and employers, and speaks frequently about career development and successful job search methods. Katherine has published three books on job hunting, as part of The Job Seeker Manifesto. Her a fourth book, Talent Search Marketing Plan, is in the works.\n This Week’s Job Search Resource\n Ben shares a list of  10 Jobs that didn’t exist 10 years ago to highlight why you have to be flexible and adaptable in your career. You can’t predict the new career opportunities that will emerge in the future (or which jobs will simply disappear) so you have to stay informed and open to change.\n This Week’s Listener Question\n Jessica and the team answer a question from listener, Andrew Cameron:\n “I’ve heard feedback on a number of my interviews that I’m overqualified. I’d be really interested in hearing your thoughts on what that means, and what I might be able to do about that.”\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question or if you’ve found a job resource you think everyone should know about email it to ben@macslist.org or call at 716-JOB-TALK.

"description":"At some point in your career you’ll need to negotiate. Maybe it’ll be for the salary you deserve. Or for better benefits. Or for some extra time off for a special vacation. Whatever your ask, you’ll probably need to negotiate with your boss to get what you want.\n When people think about negotiation, they tend to imagine a haggling session, where each side makes demands—one high and one low—and they eventually meet somewhere in the middle. According to Jeff Weiss, author of Harvard Business Review’s Guide to Negotiating, this kind of linear, zero-sum thinking limits your opportunity to find creative, win-win solutions.\n In this bonus episode of Find Your Dream Job, Jeff shares four strategies to improve your negotiation skills and get better outcomes. His tips include:\n  Know your “why’s.” Understand the underlying reason you’re asking for more time, money or benefits. This can open up more opportunities for a mutually beneficial solution with your employer.\n \n Don’t fall into stereotypical thinking.  Don’t fall for the zero-sum-game approach to negotiation. Both sides can “win.”\n \n Avoid emotionally driven ultimatums. Negotiation is stressful and people sometimes say things they don’t mean. Steer clear of manipulative language and subjective standards.\n \n Take the lead. Be proactive in your negotiation. Don’t wait for the other side to act first.

"description":"A job search can be an emotional rollercoaster. The process of sending out resumes, getting excited about opportunities, prepping for interviews, and waiting for feedback can be stressful. And, if you don’t get the job you want, it can be a painful blow to your ego.\n This week’s guest expert, Alison Cardy, argues that job search stress stems from a couple basic dynamics:\n  Putting deadlines on things we cannot control. Job seekers have limited influence on the speed of the hiring process, so setting arbitrary expectations that you’ll find a job in two weeks--or even two months--is a recipe for future upset. \n \n Internalizing rejection. Failure is the norm in the job search process; you need to be able to accept rejection without taking it personally. Don’t let one bad interview, define who you are and the value you can bring to an organization.\n \n Putting all our eggs in one basket. Don’t focus all your attention on a single interview or opportunity. Continue your job search activities so that you have fallback options.  Alison urges job seekers to maintain perspective and stay in reality. Remember who you really are and what you are capable of doing. You should also make sure you’re not investing all of your time and energy into a job search. It’s important to take care of your whole self so that you remain resilient during this difficult period of your life.\n This Week’s Guest: Alison Cardy\n Alison Cardy is the Founder and CEO of Cardy Career Coaching. Her international team guides people through career changes. Alison’s firm focuses on that crucial step before your job search begins: Helping you figure out what it is you want to do with your life. She’s also the author of Career Grease: How to Get Unstuck and Pivot Your Career. If you are having trouble which direction you should focus your job search, Alison’s book is a great resource.\n This Week’s resource\n Ben shares a post from ThoughtCatalog:  27 People Reveal The Most Ridiculously Crazy Things They Have Said At Their Job Interviews. This is a list of funny and creative answers people have given before they have been offered a job.\n This Week’s Listener Question\n This week, Kristin Schuchman, career coach at A Portland Career, joined the Mac’s List team as a fill-in guest host.

"description":"The interview is your first, and sometimes only, opportunity to make a positive personal impression with an employer. You don’t want to wing it or walk into the meeting unprepared. You need to have a solid game plan and good talking points to make the most of this opportunity.\n However, it’s important to note that all interviews are not created equal. Every organization has its own needs and internal culture; every hiring manager has a unique personality and history that you need to consider.\n This is why it is so important that you research an organization and the people you’ll meet before you walk into an interview. Don’t use your one-hour meeting as discovery session. Instead, do your homework ahead of time and come in as an informed candidate with some ideas of how you can address the employer's challenges.\n This week’s guest expert, Jessica Smith, lays out a plan for how you can best prepare for your next interview. Read the company’s website, find commonalities between the job description and your skills, and view the LinkedIn profiles of the internal recruiter or hiring manager you’ll be meeting with. Figuring out who the company likes to hire, and knowing the organization’s buzzwords gives you instant credibility,\n When it’s time to answer the tough interview questions, Jessica recommends looking through your background to find a project with a clear objective or goal, and one with a discrete beginning and end. If you are unsure what project to choose, use the company’s job description as a guide. Then, describe the project using the STAR method\n Situation — Describe the situation.\nTask — Describe the task you were given.\nAction — Describe what you did.\nResult — Describe the outcome.\n Jessica also urges job seekers to always discuss past accomplishments in the first person singular--saying “I” instead of “we.” Job seekers often want to be modest and credit a team approach for their accomplishments. But speaking with an “I” perspective better conveys that you had an active role in these projects.\n This Week’s Guest: Jessica Smith\n Jessica Smith is a career and wellness coach for 20-somethings. Her coaching philosophy centers around the idea that everybody has an internal voice of wisdom that can help you live with more flow, confidence, and joy. Jessica is the author of the forthcoming book, Your Twenties, which is scheduled for publication later in 2017. She is also the host of the weekly podcast,  Career Coaching with Jessness.\n Jessica has free career success guide for listeners on her website, Jessness Required.\n This Week’s Resource\n LinkedIn has a new feature that allows users to  quietly signal recruiters that they are looking for new professional opportunities. This is a great option if you currently have a job and don’t want your employer to know you’re looking. To turn on this feature, go to the “Jobs” tab of LinkedIn, and toggle the “Open Candidate” button.\n This Week’s Listener Question:\n Jessica, Ben, and Mac answer Chris Mitchell’s question: “How long should I wait after a job interview to follow up with a hiring manager?”\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question or if you’ve found a job resource you think everyone should know about email it to ben@macslist.org or call at 716-JOB-TALK.

"description":"Your cover letter is one of the most important elements of your application--perhaps as important as your resume. This is where you outline your passion for the position and make the case for why you are the best candidate for the job.\n Unfortunately, too many job seekers undervalue and underthink their cover letter. Sometimes they fail to include a cover letter in their application. More often--but equally detrimental--they use the same generic, cookie-cutter cover letter for all their applications.\n This simply doesn’t cut it.\n On this bonus episode of Find Your Dream Job, Jenny Foss, founder of JobJenny.com, shares how your generic cover letter reads to a hiring manager.  Her entertaining, “what-not-to-write” cover letter hits home with insights on how you can improve your own cover letter right away.\n When you read your cover letter from a hiring manager’s point of view it starts to read differently than when you are reading it for yourself. Jenny reminds us not to regurgitate the content of our resumes into our cover letters and to not waste the hiring manager’s time with worn out cliches like “detail-oriented” and “proven track record.”\n You can find more useful job search insight in Land Your Dream Job Anywhere, now available on Amazon.

"description":"Studies show that many women don’t negotiate for salary as often as men during the hiring process. Guest expert Ashley Milne-Tyte says women leave money on the table all the time. Salary gaps between men and women often start at the beginning of their careers, because young men are more inclined to negotiate their salary, while women tend to accept the company’s initial offer.\n Cultural conditioning and stereotypes are at the center of this problem. Talking about money can be very uncomfortable for many women, whether it’s due to lack of education about finances or fear that they’ll come off as greedy or “bossy.” Hiring managers, both men or women, may consider women  pushy or rude while the same behavior from men is seen as normal.\n However, there are various studies that show women negotiate very well when they are negotiating for someone else. So how can women take those skills and go to bat for their own benefit? Ashley recommends a book that has become her “negotiation bible: it’s called  Ask For It, by Linda Babcock and Sara Laschever. It can change a woman’s view when it comes to negotiating.\n Techniques to help women ask for and get more:\n  Do your research. Find out what people in similar positions are making, pulling both national and local salary ranges. Be calm and understand expectations. Know going in that you may get different reactions. Be calm, firm, yet friendly in your ask. Don’t accept the first offer. It’s common practice to take a day to consider an offer. Use that time to come up with a reasonable counter-ask. Have options in your ask. Whether you offer flexibility in payment schedule or other compensation instead of cash, be open but don’t roll over.  Women leave money on the table all the time. By understanding bias, doing your homework, and presenting a well-informed ask, women can negotiate for better compensation.\n This Week’s Guest: Ashley Milne-Tyte\n Ashley Milne-Tyte is a podcast host and radio and print reporter based in New\n York. She has reported extensively for  Marketplace, the public radio business\n show, as well as local stations and smaller shows. Ashley teaches at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism. Her podcast on women and the workplace, The Broad Experience, has been featured on best podcast lists in\n The Guardian, Fortune, and Entrepreneur.\n Ashley will focus on conservative women in the workplace, and Executive Assistants, on her upcoming podcasts.\n This Week’s Job Search Resource:\n Ben’s resource this week is an article from Inc. entitled  Why You Should Tell Your Coworkers How Much Money You Make. The article tackles the touchy subject of discussing salaries in the workplace, and considers salary transparency as a tool for  uncovering unfair wage gaps.\n This Week’s Listener Question:\n This week, Kristin Schuchman, career coach at A Portland Career, joined the Mac’s List team as a fill-in guest host. Kristin, Ben, and Mac answer Samantha Marshall’s question:\n “I've been working at my job for several years, and they have told me several\n times that they would pay for me to go to grad school, but when I bring it up,\n they push back or say they have to consider it. I really want to go to grad school, but I can't afford to do it on my own so this would be a really great opportunity — but I'm worried it will strain my work relationship if I keep asking.

"description":"Losing your job—under any circumstances—is a painful, embarrassing experience, and it’s natural to be upset. You may feel like you’ve lost control of your life, or that you’ll never find another job.  Plus there’s the stress of managing your financial responsibilities on a diminished income.\n While it’s natural to be anxious after a layoff, you shouldn’t let panic drive you to rash decisions. So say this week’s guest, Jane Jackson. Instead, give yourself time to heal and figure out the next step in your career.\n Jane suggests that you reach out to trusted friends and professional contacts to help you avoid catastrophic thinking and maintain perspective. These people can help clarify where you are where you are in life and what options are available.\n Only after you’ve properly dealt with the emotional aspect of a job loss, should you create a plan to find your next gig. If you jump too quickly into the job search process, you’re likely to come across as desperate or needy to potential employers—a dynamic that will only lead to more frustration on your part.\n This Week's Guest: Jane Jackson Jane Jackson is a career and life coach who has worked with thousands of clients across Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Europe. She is the author of the Amazon #1 bestseller, Navigating Career Crossroads: How to Thrive when Changing Direction.

"description":"Women are much more likely than men to leave the workforce to raise children or assist elderly family members. Unfortunately, after a prolonged time off, it’s not easy to on-ramp back into full employment. There simply is not much infrastructure to help women step back into the workforce. That’s why it’s so important to be prepared before you take your hiatus.\n On this bonus episode of Find Your Dream Job, Farai Chideya, author of The Episodic Career: How to Thrive and Work in the Age of Disruption, explains what women should to before they take time off to lay the foundation for their eventual return to the workforce. \n Her suggestions include:\n  Document all the work you have done. You're less likely to remember everything if you wait until you're ready to return to work. Sit down with your current supervisor and ask them to itemize your accomplishments and highlight your skill sets. Ask for the document to be added to your personal file and keep a copy for yourself.

"description":"We say it a lot here at Mac’s List: networking is the single best thing you can do for your job search—or your career, in general. But attending a single networking event probably isn’t going to land you a job right away. Networking is about building mutually-beneficial, long-term relationships, not making awkward demands for a job.\n In fact, according to this week’s guest, Abby Kohl, the single biggest mistake you can make in a networking event is to ask for a job. Another fatal error is beginning a conversation by announcing your unemployment. Both actions are deadly mistakes for the same reason: they make networking all about you and your needs. Such an approach is more likely to scare people away than to lead to a constructive conversation.\n Instead, Abby recommends that you always focus on how you can help the person you’re talking to. Listen to their ideas, try to identify their challenges, and ask how you can help. This positions you as a solution provider—the kind of employer every organization wants. It also builds goodwill with your contact, increasing the likelihood that they will assist you in your job search.\n Abby’s other networking tips include:\n  When you’ve made a good connection, ask for a follow-up meeting over lunch or coffee. Find a “job search buddy” who is looking for similar work. Always have business cards available. Never say you’re unemployed. Instead, say that you are “between successes.”  This Week's Guest: Abby Kohut Abby Kohut, founder of Absolutely Abby, is a recruiter who has filled more than 10,000 jobs. Through her website, books, and talks Abby shares hiring secrets other recruiters won’t tell you. Abby is on a mission to help one million job seekers. She is now driving across the United States on a nationwide tour to accomplish the goal.\n If you have a job search group, contact Abby on her website to create an event in your town. Meet Abby offers a free teleseminar, “Interviewing Ingenuity.”\n This Week’s Job Search Resource Ben’s resource this week is from the PBS segment, \"How to Make a Personal Connection with an Employer Even if the Job Listing Forbids It,\" by headhunter, Nick Corcodilos. Most job postings explicitly say ‘no calls please.’ Nick recommends finding an alternative way to contact the hiring manager and discussing their problems in a constructive manner.\n This Week’s Listener Question Joining the Mac's List team as a guest-host is Andrea Gerson, Portland-based career coach and principal at Resume Scripter.  Andrea, Ben, and Mac offer advice to listener Megan Smith, who wants to know which format she should use for her resume.\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question or if you’ve found a job resource you think everyone should know about email it to ben@macslist.org or call at 716-JOB-TALK.

"description":"The traditional hiring process is broken and everyone knows it--both job seekers and hiring managers. The over-automated, keyword-driven, impersonal way most organizations hire is a relic of software systems built 40+ years ago. As such, playing by the rules is more likely to land you a stress headache than a job offer.\n This week's guest, Liz Ryan, offers a ray of hope, with strategies and techniques that will help you rise above the rest when reaching out to employers. She encourages job seekers to break the rules of the system. Instead, she urges people to proactively reach out to the organizations where they most want to work--and where they can create the most value.\n In practice, this means:\n  Ignore the formal hiring process. Decide where you want to work, and have an idea of how they can help the company. Use LinkedIn’s advanced search to find the person who would be your boss if they were to get the job they wanted. Send a pain letter to that person at their place of employment.  A pain letter is a letter that focuses on your contact's specific challenges and highlights how you can help with these problems. The first sentence should be the hook to pique the person’s interest. Include a story which highlights the pain or problem the manager may be experiencing, and end the letter with a soft and respectful, “I’d be happy to start a phone or email conversation with you.”\n This Week's Guest: Liz Ryan Liz Ryan is the founder and CEO of Human Workplace, a think tank and publishing firm whose mission is to reinvent work for people. Liz is the author of Reinvention Roadmap: Break the Rules to Get the Job You Want and the Career You Want. She writes for Forbes.com, LinkedIn, and other publications. Liz is a highly sought-after keynote speaker who has hired over 10,000 people.\n Liz’s work in 2017 includes empowering workers and reinventing corporate work environments in an effort to move them away from a mechanical mode and back into a human mode.\n Resource of the Week Ben’s resource this week is a blog post from Allison Green titled,  Gimmicks Won’t Get You a Job. Allison has an entire page of zany and outlandish things people have done to try and land a job. Favorites include a spouse who advertised her job-hunting spouse on a billboard and a person who sent a framed picture of themselves to a hiring manager.\n Listener Question of the Week Jessica, Ben, and Mac offer advice to Nicole Wilson, who wants to know guidelines for using unlimited paid-time-off (PTO) offered by some employers.\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question or if you’ve found a job resource you think everyone should know about email it to ben@macslist.org or call at 716-JOB-TALK.

"description":"Many people believe retirement means working until a certain age and then enjoying a life of leisure. The problem with this thinking, says this week's guest expert, Nancy Collamer, is that most of us are facing the 40/30 dilemma. After working (only) 40 years in a full-time career, 30 years of retirement can be too many hours to fill, and too many years to fund.\n That's why Nancy urges people to make retirement more than just gardening, grandkids, and golfing. You can also use this time to explore a second act career.  A part-time job to supplement our income, or a volunteer position may be just what the doctor ordered.\n A Second Act Career\n A second act career is the work we do after our primary careers. In general, the work is more fun, more flexible, and more fulfilling than our previous work. Nancy notes that many people find it daunting to plan for their second act career, so she suggests three steps to help with the process:\n  Introspection —  Think about what you want, and how you want to do it. Idea Generation — Get out there, and research your options. Experimentation — Try things out, to see what fits.  The sooner you start this process, the better! Finding your encore career earlier in life, may allow you to quit you unfulfilling 9-5 job before you otherwise expected. A second act career can also mean you don’t have to dip into your savings as early. You can delay accessing your Social Security, and that is a financial gain.\n Bucket or Chuck It?\n Nancy recommends planning for your retirement hours with a bucket list and a chuck it list. A bucket list is a way to make sure you get in everything you’ve ever wanted in life, while a chuck it list allows you to say goodbye to those things you never really liked, such as traffic and spreadsheets.\n This Week's Guest: Nancy Collamer Nancy Collamer is an expert on second-act careers, semi-retirement and boomer career trends. She writes a career blog for Forbes.com and the PBS website NextAvenue.org. Nancy is also the author of Second-Act Careers: 50+ Ways to Profit Your Passions During Semi-Retirement and a contributor to Not Your Mother's Retirement and 65 Things To Do When You Retire.\n Nancy publishes her free newsletter on My Lifestyle Career and she is working on a digital product to help people jump start their second act career planning process.\n  \n Resource of the Week Ben’s resource this week is the Huffington Post — Reinvention Section. This entire section is for those lucky people who are 50+ are interested in reinventing their life, career or location. There are some great articles here and some not so great, so browse around.\n Listener Question of the Week Jessica, Ben, and Mac offer advice to Ryan Wilson who is looking for guidance about to talk about himself and his accomplishments, without coming off as boastful.\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question or if you’ve found a job resource you think everyone should know about email it to ben@macslist.org or call at 716-JOB-TALK.

"description":"It is against the law for employers to discriminate based on age. Yet, ageism is an undeniable truth in the modern workforce.\n In this bonus episode of Find Your Dream Job, Kerry Hannon,  author of Love Your Job: The New Rules of Career Happiness, shares her tips on how you can overcome age bias when looking for a new job.\n Employers can be skeptical about hiring older workers because they worry:\n  You don’t have the stamina for the job. You may not be up to speed or willing to learn new technology. Your salary demands may be too high and your health benefits cost more. You won’t be able to answer to or take direction from younger bosses.

"description":"\"What do you do for a living?\" It's a question you probably get often, especially when meeting new people. What you say matters a lot, says this week's guest expert, Christina Canters. Your answer may lead to your next job or it can help you move up in your career.\n Because the question is so common, however, most people don’t give it much thought. They simply spit out their title and then stop. Christina says a title doesn’t give the other person anything to respond to. A better answer to \"what do you do\" can be a starting point to a more engaging conversation.\n Christina offers these tips when sharing what you do:\n  When speaking with people outside your field, explain your job in language and metaphors that are easily understandable. Explain who you help in your job--and how you might be able to help the person you're speaking with. Add a fun fact about your work just after your title.  If you're currently unemployed and looking for work, use the \"what do you do\" question as an opportunity. Put a positive spin on your situation by saying “I’m looking for new opportunities at the moment. I’m looking to help or do…”\n Christina also emphasizes the importance of confidence when explaining your job.  If you don’t come across as confident in yourself, why would anyone else be confident in you?\n Her tips for projecting confidence include:\n  Get into a positive state-of-mind before you arrive at an event or presentation. Do power poses to put yourself in a positive physical state. Watch your language and remove the words “just a” before your title.  This Weeks Guest: Christina Canters Christina Canters is a communication skills speaker, coach and host of the podcast, Stand Out, Get Noticed. Her website, the CMethod, helps ambitious professionals become more effective and confident when they speak, present and pitch. An engaging speaker, Christina has wowed audiences at organizations and conferences around the world with her passion, humor, and the occasional ukulele song.\n Resource of the Week Ben’s resource this week is the blog post  Why Are Job Titles Important to Your Career? from The Balance. Titles are an important part of the compensation management system. The article includes common job titles and descriptions of what the job title includes.\n Listener Question of the Week Jessica, Ben, and Mac offer advice to Abbey Pendley who is looking for guidance about mentioning ongoing freelance work to a possible new full-time employer?\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question or if you’ve found a job resource you think everyone should know about email it to ben@macslist.org or call at 716-JOB-TALK.

Job seekers need a strong, robust presence to demonstrate their capabilities, and communicate what makes them stand out above other candidates. If your profile is not updated, it may appear you are out of touch with the new world of work.\n Tips for Writing Your LinkedIn Content\n  Provide the information your intended reader will be looking for. Make it as easy as possible for employers to know what you need them to know about you. Blend your soft skills with your hard skills to tell a good story about yourself.

"description":"Job interviews can be dry and intimidating. They normally have a set format in which the interviewer and interviewee go back and forth, over and over. But it doesn't need to be this way.\n Our guest this week, Jeff Altman, suggests that job seekers have the power to turn any interview into a dynamic conversation between equals. He believes you can do this by asking one question as soon as you begin the conversation. The question is simple: \"Tell me about the job as you see it, and what I can do to help?\"\n This question is a game-changer because it sets you up with all the information you need for the rest of the interview--specifically, what the hiring manager sees as the biggest challenge for the organization. Plus, you level the playing field with the interviewer and set yourself apart from the competition.\n Jeff discusses how to interpret the hiring manager's reaction to this question, and other workplace dynamics you can infer from how he or she responds to your prompt.\n This Week's Guest: Jeff Altman Jeff Altman, known as The Big Game Hunter, has helped organizations find leaders, employees, and consultants since 1971.

"description":"LinkedIn is the dominant social media platform for professional networking, and employers have taken notice. Nearly 80% of recruiters use LinkedIn to find candidates.  They are searching for specific skills and when they find the right fit, they won't hesitate to reach out--even if the person isn't actively looking for work.\n If you've never been contacted by an employer on LinkedIn, you might not be using the right job titles and keywords in your profile. This week's guest expert, Marc Miller, argues that you've got to optimize your LinkedIn profile to make it easy for employers to find you. He explains how to use keywords in your job title, summary and headline that an employer would use is key.\n Marc shares how to use tools like Tag Cloud or Wordle to identify the keywords that most resonate with prospective employers. Then he identifies explains exactly where to use these keywords in your LinkedIn profile.\n His most important point: take advantage of all the available space in your 120-character headline and the 180-character job title. These are the most searched fields on LinkedIn. If you're leaving white space in those areas, you're missing a huge opportunity!\n This Week's Guest: Marc Miller Marc Miller has worked at IBM, taught high school math, and had a near fatal bicycle accident that changed his perspective forever.

"description":"Have you ever had a prospective employer ask about your desired salary? Or inquire about your salary history? Companies ask these questions to weed out applicants and (sometimes) get the upper-hand in pay negotiations.\n This week’s guest, Jim Hopkinson, argues that your response to salary questions can be the difference in whether or not you get an offer and how much leverage you have in future pay discussions.\n The employer does not necessarily hold all the cards when it comes to negotiating salaries. Jim recommends finding out all the facts about the job before you even start discussing salary. You may find there are job responsibilities which warrant a higher pay scale. And if you are the right fit for the job, you can enter the salary discussion knowing you have something of exceptional value to the company.\n Here are Jim’s recommendations if you are required to enter your desired salary in an application:\n  Respond with a phrase like “negotiable,” or, “To be discussed during interview.” Try adding a nonsense number like “$0” or “$1,000,000” to show you are purposely not answering the question. If the system doesn’t allow a nonsense number use a numerical range.  If you are unsure which salary range you fall into, Jim says there are five different ways to research how much you are worth:\n  Go to salary sites. (Glassdoor.com, Payscale.com, etc.) Look at industry salary guides. (Robert Hath) Go to job sites and search your title. Internal networking with people you know. External networking with people you don’t know.  Pro Tip — Job seekers should be spending 4 out of 5 days at job fairs and other face-to-face networking events.\n This Week's Guest: Jim Hopkinson\n Through his Salary Tutor website, Jim Hopkinson teaches people how to negotiate their salaries, and get paid what they are worth. He’s the author of  Salary Tutor: Learn The Salary Negotiation Secrets No One Ever Taught You, and the co-author of  How To Quit Your Job - The Right Way: A 5-Step Plan To Ditching Your Day Job. His free introductory course,  The Negotiation Mindset, is available on his website.\n Resource of the Week\n Ben’s resource this week is a blog post,  How to Respond to Salary History Requests, from the U.S. News and World Report Careers Blog by Alison Green. He also shares a related news story from the New York Times entitled  Illegal in Massachusetts: Asking Your Salary in a Job Interview.\n Listener Question of the Week\n Jenna, Ben, and Mac offer advice to Jeff Croxford, who asks: “What current platforms and skills would be transferrable to most IT careers?”\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question or if you’ve found a job resource you think everyone should know about email it to ben@macslist.org or call at  716-JOB-TALK.

"description":"What do you want to be when you grow up? It's OK if you are still unable to answer this question, argues guest expert, Srinivas Rao. There's always time to change paths and find a more personally rewarding career that resonates with your passions.\n Most people try to create a linear career path; each new job is a stepping stone to ever increasing levels of responsibility. This thinking is driven by the chase for money and the expectations of others. But the real problem is that a linear career doesn't always lead to interesting jobs. Our interests change as we age, so we need to create opportunities to explore new directions in work.\n Choosing a job you enjoy allows you to thrive. You may get paid less, but you will be more productive, engaged, and happy.\n Of course, money is an always an issue. When planning a career, consider what jobs may increase your long-term earning potential, even at the expense of short-term salary. If you are a recent college graduate or have been let go from a position, use the time to evaluate what matters to you and prepare yourself for the job you want. As Srinivas says “sometimes it takes a disruption to initiate change.”\n If it feels like you are being herded in a particular direction to go along with the crowd, get a decent-paying job and settle in, it’s because you are. Social norms often dictate what people with normal jobs do. To find a compelling interesting career, you need to break the mold and focus on your own personal passions and interests.\n This Week's Guest: Srinivas Rao Srinivas Rao is the host and founder of The Unmistakable Creative podcast where he’s interviewed more than 600 thought leaders and people from all walks of life.  He’s also written multiple books including the Wall Street Journal bestseller The Art of Being Unmistakable.\n Srinivas is currently working on his second book, which is about the creative habits and the creative process. He says, “it will be a map of how to create in a distraction-driven world.”\n Resource of the Week Ben’s resource this week is the article  \"The 21 Most Valuable Career Skills Now\" put together by Money Magazine and Payscale.com. The authoritative list includes which skills generate the highest increase in pay. They found employers willing to pay more for the ability to make sense of big data, the ability to manage the bottom line, the ability to leverage new technology and strategic thinking skills.\n Listener Question of the Week Jenna, Ben, and Mac offer advice to Anne-Marie Sheridan, who asks: “How do you know if a company reaching out to you on LinkedIn is a scam?”\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question, email it to jenna@macslist.org, or call her at 716-JOB-TALK. Or, if you’ve found a job resource you think everyone should know about, send it to ben@macslist.org, and tell him how it has helped you find your dream job.\n If you like this show, please help us by rating and reviewing our podcast on iTunes.

"description":"This episode is about explicitly about first jobs, but the lessons we share can apply to just about any job, no matter how established you are as professional.\n The average worker will have 8-11 jobs over the course of their lifetime. Each position can (and should) be a stepping-stone to a bigger, better opportunity in the future. But to make this happen, you need to do more than just show up and collect a paycheck… you need to network!\n Our guest expert, David Mariano, recommends building relationships within your company, both inside and outside of your immediate job environment. These connections will benefit you immediately with additional understandings of how the piece parts of your organization work together; they will also prove beneficial to your future endeavors.\n Getting to know people in various positions is a tried and true networking technique. Today’s middle manager could be tomorrow’s VP. If you consistently treat people the way you want to be treated, you will gain influence. Also, asking for help and asking a lot of questions can lead to great insights. You will find people are willing to help if you have an honest motive.\n It is advisable in today’s work environment to find a mentor. Look for someone with the character you want to have when you reach a level you want to someday attain. It may be someone outside your current organization. To further your business acumen, listen to podcasts and read leadership books.\n Pro Tip — Many companies have groups or clubs during non-work hours, find an event you can attend.\n David Mariano Bio\n David Mariano is the founder of Finance Career Launch, a career development site that includes a podcast, course, and other resources. He is also a director with Western Reserve Partners, a middle market investment bank. In his career, David has worked with company owners, CEOs, and CFOs, as an advisor, part-owner, or executive.\n Sign up for a free 7-part video course, The Seven Pillars of a Successful Career in Finance. The content includes skills, habits, and mindsets found in the most successful people.\n Ben’s Job Search Resource:\n Ben’s resource this week is from Adweek. The post entitled  \"6  Common  Mistakes  Recent  Graduates  Make  and  How  to  Avoid  Them,\" by Molly Folse is applicable to any worker at any age. Failing to negotiate, impatience about paying dues, gossiping or griping to fit in are common mistakes.

"description":"Successful job searches require time and effort. Spending time customizing job applications, targeting a job search, and a goal-oriented personal brand, will help job seekers find success more quickly, says career advice expert, Amanda Augustine. She advises job seekers to pick one goal for their job search, and then make sure all materials they create reflect that goal.\n In today’s world, a professional resume is not enough. Job seekers also need to have an online presence that tells a consistent story. 90% of employers research job applicants online before deciding to interview them. This means social media accounts should have the proper privacy settings and your LinkedIn profile should closely match your job search goal. You are selling the most important thing you will ever sell in your life, which is your experience and your talents.\n Even if you are considering a short-term job to pay the bills, look for the jobs that make the most sense for your long-term goals. If you are overqualified or underqualified for a job, but have reasons for pursuing it, utilize a cover letter to explain your reasons. Amanda suggests leveraging your network. A Career Crossroads study found job seekers are 10 times more likely to get a position, when an application is accompanied by a referral from an employee.\n Mix these 3 methods of job searches for best results:\n  Online job listings. Leverage a personal and professional network. Outreach to recruiters.  Applications and resumes will more than likely go through a piece of electronic software known as an applicant tracking system. The systems are designed to screen and rank resumes before sending them to the recruiter or hiring manager. If your resume is not formatted to make it through the system, a human may never read it.  Do online research to make sure you include the right keywords to pass the initial gatekeeper system.\n Pro Tip — Make sure the must-haves of a job description match your qualifications closely.\n Amanda Augustine Bio\n Amanda Augustine is the career advice expert for TopResume. She gives job search and career guidance to professionals who want better careers, and to find the right job, sooner.  Amanda blogs regularly about career advancement on the TopResume website and also contributes to The Huffington Post. Her blog post,  7 Important Questions Every Job Seeker Should Ask Themselves inspired today’s podcast episode.\n Ben’s Job Search Resource:\n Ben’s resource this week is Cold Turkey. Cold Turkey is commitment based software that blocks websites you use as diversions, such as Facebook or other social media. The program includes a timer and once you set the timer you are unable to access the websites you submitted for up to 8 hours. Job seekers can use this to block notifications from job list websites that send out hourly notifications.\n Jenna’s Find Your Dream Job Listener Question:\n Jenna, Ben, and Mac offer advice to Thomas Ewing, who asks today’s Listener Question, “Should a recent college graduate go directly to graduate school or get job experience first?”\n Listen to this podcast resource for additional information on the topic:\n   How to Transition from College to Career with Satya Byock  If you would like the team to answer a job-related question, email it to jenna@macslist.org, or call her at  716-JOB-TALK.

"description":"Contrary to popular belief, women don’t need to be coders or programmers, to get a great job in the tech industry, says guest expert, Allison Esposito. The tech industry is full of sales, marketing, and engineering positions that need to be filled. Even if a woman has never worked in the tech industry, she has transferable skills that apply to tech jobs.\n Breaking into the tech field can be difficult because big tech companies have so many competitive applicants. It can be hard for a person to stand out, especially if they don’t have any experience in the tech field. Allison suggests women apply to smaller startups, to gain experience and to build their resumes.\n The gender gap in the tech world is quite large. It can be seen in small startups, all the way up to big companies. Big companies report a ‘Pipeline Problem,’ which means they don’t believe women are out in the job market, or that their skill level is not up to par with the men applying for the same positions. Allison doesn’t believe it’s a pipeline problem, she thinks it is a connection problem.\n To see where you might fit in the tech world, consider what you are already doing, and see where your skills fit. To make the switch to a career in tech:\n  Make sure you are using the product or service of the company you wish to work for. Jot down what you would do differently if you worked for the company. Join online groups, and follow people who have the type of jobs you want. Absorb as much as you can in the media and at meetups.  Women can often be intimidated to attend IT meetups because they don’t feel they fit the traditional mold of young, male IT employees. Allison says if you go to a networking event with small goals and low expectations it will be less intimidating.\n Pro Tip — Make a list of the companies you want to work for, and start building your network within those companies.\n Allison Esposito Bio\n Allison Esposito is the founder of Tech Ladies, a community that connects women with the best jobs in technology, and companies with the best women tech makers. Allison is also a branding and marketing expert, who has worked for Google, Foursquare, and other tech firms.\n In 2017, Allison will be gearing up her product roadmap and event calendar for ever-evolving Tech Ladies Community.\n Ben’s Job Search Resource:\n Ben’s resource this week is the blog post,  Top 8 Signs an Employer is Family Friendly. Ben consistently receives questions from parents about how to find out if a company is family friendly before they apply for a position. This article is loaded with tips, including look for a company with a high percentage of female executives and female employees.\n Jenna’s Find Your Dream Job Listener Question:\n Jenna, Ben, and Mac offer advice to Mindy Hoffman, who asks today’s Listener Question, “How to ask for a raise without seeming pushy, yet maintain your assertiveness?” The Mac’s List team recommends Ramit Sethi’s  Ultimate Guide to Asking for a Raise and Negotiating Salary, the podcast episode with Jeff Weiss,  3 Steps to Take in Any Job Negotiation and the Josh Doody episode,  How to Get Your Next Raise.If you would like the team to answer a job-related question, email it to\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question, email it to jenna@macslist.org, or call her at  716-JOB-TALK.

Practice with other people. Practice your pitch in front of an objective person.  Most importantly, be authentic! Wear your transparent and open; honesty is the best policy.\n Pro Tip\n  \n Be sure your pitch works for different audiences.\n  \n This Week's Guest\n Jeff Kleid is a motivational speaker who delivers workshops and online training classes that teach businesses how to engage, connect, and grow.

Today’s guest expert, Anna Runyan, says there are three main obstacles for job seekers searching for their dream job. They are:\n  Time:  Consider what job searching tasks can be batched to save time. Plan out priorities on a calendar. Put extra effort into networking.   Fear:  Job seekers may fear of applying for jobs they don’t think they are qualified for. Job seekers should surround themselves with supportive network groups such as Facebook, Masterminds, and industry forums. Job Seekers need to get over the fear of networking with people they don’t know.   Direction:  Figure out your ideal career fit.  i. Look at your previous career experiences. ii. Make a list of things you love doing, and things you do not want to do.   Determine your ideal work day, and then map it out.    Pro Tip — Informational interviews with people already working in the field you want to work in, can help you determine the next steps of your job search.\n Anna Runyan Bio\n Anna Runyan is the founder of Classy Career Girl, named by Forbes as one of the 35 most influential career sites of 2014.  She helps women design and launch their dream careers, businesses, and lives.

"description":"Have you sent out 50 resumes, only to get 50 emails from automated system replies? If so, your resume might not have what it takes to get the attention of the hiring manager.\n Pete Mockaitis says the main reason resumes are ignored is because job seekers don’t put in the proper time, effort, or consideration into these vital documents. Often, people send out the same resume for each job opportunity. To truly enhance your resume, Pete says you need to spend the necessary time to hone your story message, to match exactly what a potential employer is looking for.\n Helpful guidelines to follow when overhauling your resume:\n  Move away from listing previous responsibilities and showcase your achievements. Quantify your achievements with numbers and percentages. Bullet points should share results first and then relay how the result was obtained. If you’ve got it flaunt it, a resume is no place to be shy. Remove the objective. A two-page resume is acceptable if you are seeking an executive position. A resume should be in chronological format unless you are recently out of school, if so, a functional format may highlight your talents efficiently.  Pro Tip — Recruiters may have a specific profile in mind when they are filling a position so make sure your resume fits that profile.\n Pete Mockaitis Bio\n Pete Mockaitis is an award-winning trainer who has served clients in over 50 countries. His work has enhanced Fortune 100 corporations, high-growth startups, and major nonprofits. He began his career at acclaimed consulting firms The Bridgespan Group and Bain & Company. Pete is also the host of the podcast, How to Be Awesome at Your Job, and the author of the book, Team Up: Becoming Accountable to Your Dreams.\n Ben’s Job Search Resource:\n Ben’s resource this week is  \"Searching for Work in the Digital Era,\" from the Pew Research Center for Internet, Science and Technology. There are three trends highlighted by the report, and they are, the Internet is the primary form of research for job seekers, mobile phones are the primary job search tool, and social media is a growing research resource for finding jobs. The report is supported by quantifiable data.\n Jenna’s Find Your Dream Job Listener Question:\n Jenna offers her advice to listener Brett Williams, who asks: “How do you learn the typical salary local employers pay in your field?”\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question, email it to jenna@macslist.org, or call her at  716-JOB-TALK.

"description":"Did you just spill your coffee all down the front of your shirt? Or, did you forget to turn the ringer off your phone before the interview started?\n Today’s guest expert, Dan Miller says the good thing about interview fails is that they are easily remedied. The number one thing Dan sees in interviewees, which hurt their chances at a position, is a lack of enthusiasm and energy. He says job seekers who want to show their enthusiasm should:\n  Walk briskly Sit up straight Speak from their diaphragm Convey a lot of energy  These actions show the interviewer that you have something to offer, and as an employee, you are someone who will do more than expected. If you are an introvert, you don’t need to change who you are naturally, but show a lot of energy during a job interview.\n Dan says job seekers should be prepared with a two-minute answer to the 20 most common interview questions. Interviewers want to know how a job candidate will handle a conflict or how they go about solving a problem. So, candidates should also prepare for a few behavioral questions.\n An interview is a time set aside by a company to see if a job candidate is right for their organization. On the flip side, an interview is a time set aside by a job seeker to see if a particular company is right for them.\n Interview Do’s and Don’ts:\n  Do ask the interviewer about the company at the end of the interview. Don’t ask about the compensation for the job too quickly. Do send a thank you as a follow-up immediately after the interview. Do make yourself more memorable with a handwritten follow-up. Do bring every ounce of enthusiasm you can muster to the interview.  Pro Tip — Preparation matters! Know the company’s mission statement and at least one thing about the person handling your interview before the interview starts.\n Dan Miller Bio\n Dan Miller is President of 48 Days a company that specializes in creative thinking for increased personal and business success. He is the author of the New York Times bestsellers, 48 Days To The Work You Love, No More Dreaded Mondays and Wisdom Meets Passion. Dan has been a featured guest on CBS’s The Early Show, MSNBC’s Hardball with Chris Matthews and the Dave Ramsey Show.  Dan will soon be introducing a seminar to accompany his book, 48 Days.

Jobcase is the networking equivalent of Linkedin but for people who are unemployed. It is a community for people who are looking for work.

"description":"After you have fully processed what happened, your next step is to look at your budget to find your unnecessary expenses. Pull out large recurring expenses that may provide you enjoyment, but aren’t providing any tangible benefits. A cable bill is a good example of this. Every dollar you have saved becomes important if you are unsure of how long you will be without work. Other expenses which should be cut are things you can make at home for a lesser cost, such as coffees and meals.\n Your financial accounts should be used in the following order:\n  Checking — Use this fluid money first. Savings — Banks pay little to no interest in these accounts. Stocks — Sell off stocks if they are outside of a retirement account. 401K/IRA — Use this option only as a last resort.  Do you have student loans? Eric says no matter which type of student loan you have, federal or private, you should notify the lending institution that holds your loan. Many times, during hardships these institutions offer deferments, which lower your monthly loan payments, but the company continues to earn interest on the balance.\n Ignoring health care coverage is a big no-no. In fact, under the Affordable Care Act, it is a requirement for individuals to have current health care coverage. Your previous employer is bound to offer you COBRA, which will allow you to keep your current level of coverage, but you must pay the employer’s previous contribution amount.\n If you do not have enough money saved to last for at least 6-months consider a part-time job to make ends meet or to avoid going into debt.\n Pro Tip — If you do spend money during unemployment, invest in something which will help you to get your next job!\n Eric Rosenberg Bio\n Eric Rosenberg is a finance writer who publishes the Personal Profitability Blog and the  Personal Profitability Podcast.

"description":"Most people leave a job interview and are no closer to knowing if they will be offered the position than when they sent in their resume. Even if they feel the interview went well they realize they forgot to ask about the company or the next steps in the job process. Waiting for the company to call with feedback can be agonizing. Mac’s List listeners can avoid uncertainty by following the steps provided in this episode.\n So, what do you say when a hiring manager asks if you have any questions?\n Guest expert, J.T. O’Donnell says to ask open-ended questions and to use the job interview to find out as much about the company as possible. If you don’t, you are missing out on an important opportunity to get to know the company better. This can help you to know you are making the right choice if a job offer appears.\n The employer is expecting you to ask questions about how you can serve them and how you can earn the money they would be paying you. If your first questions are about you, it can come across selfish and self-absorbed. They want you to focus on them first. Prove that you have done your homework and demonstrate you want to learn more about the company in order to build trust and respect.\n J.T. O’Donnell guides us through her 4C Strategy, which ultimately benefits both the job candidate and the employer. The 4 C’s and helpful open-ended question a job seeker should ask are:\n  Connect\n  “How did you come to work here?” “What do you like most about working here?”     Corporate Culture\n  “Who is the most successful person hired in the last year?” “Who has been the least successful person and what went wrong?”     Challenges\n  “What is the company’s biggest challenge this year?” “How can my skills help you to overcome the challenge?”     Close\n  “Is there anything about my candidacy you would change to make me a better fit for this job?” “What are the next steps in the hiring process?”    Pro Tip — Hiring Managers hire based on personality, aptitude, and experience.\n J.T. O’Donnell Bio\n J.T. O’Donnell is a career strategist and workplace consultant who helps American workers of all ages find greater professional satisfaction through courses on her website, Work it Daily.

"description":"Are you a person who is thinking about the question you are going to ask more than you are thinking about the person who will be answering the question? Have you considered how your question or problem sounds to the other person? Guest expert Julie Broad says “People often think about themselves when they are communicating, when they should be carefully considering what matters to the other person.” Considering what perspective the question should be framed in so it matters to the other person, can make it a very different conversation AND increase your credibility.\n Job seekers should know that their vocal pace, vocal tone and body language, can erode their credibility when communicating. Julie encourages job seekers to not worry so much about what they say and to focus on how they are saying it. Making a confident statement can elevate your message.\n If you are not sure how you are communicating, try recording your side of a business conversation, or ask a trusted colleague to critique you during a networking event.\n Your Cadence Matters:\n  Talking too fast may make it difficult for people to understand you. Talking too slow may be perceived as lower intelligence. Too many filter words (ah, umm, like) may derail your credibility.  The most important things about your communications are that your message comes through clearly, and you demonstrate you know what you are talking about.\n Listen to the podcast to find out how the company you keep, and your appearance may also affect your credibility.\n Pro Tip - Dress in a way that makes you feel confident!\n Julie Broad Bio\n Julie Broad is a successful entrepreneur, speaker, and workshop trainer.  Her company, Have More Influence, helps people build personal brands that get results, and move forward in their careers and businesses.

"description":"With engagement season fast approaching, the Mac's List team (Publisher, Mac Prichard; Managing Director, Ben Forstag; and Community Manager, Jenna Forstrom) sat down to talk about Bruce Hurwitz's LinkedIn post, \"When interviewing for a job, lose the ring!\"  \n This article was published on August 12, 2016, and caused a bit of media frenzy with over 1,403 comments and 1,020 shares.  Hurwitz specifically calls out women who wear large engagement rings as being \"high maintenance\" and thus hiring managers aren't willing to give them a job offer.  Mac Prichard makes a good point that it's illegal to make hiring decisions based on marital status.  While it's hard to prove that this is happening, chances are, if you are interviewing for a job that has some questionable hiring practices, you wouldn't want to work there anyways.  Ben chimes in that some hiring managers might see a wedding ring on a young woman's hand and assume that they are going to leave the job to raise a family or need time off for maternity leave.  Jenna adds that there are some places, like in food service, where no jewelry is allowed, in that case, it's not worth wearing a ring.  Mac continues the conversation by pointing out that visibly pregnant women also struggle finding employment for similar reasons.  \n Discrimination is real when it comes to job hunting, but the data points to it being more of a gender issue versus an engagement issue. What has your experience been?  Have you ever felt like wearing an engagement ring has hindered your chances of getting a job?  Leave a comment below.\n Find Your Dream Job is sponsored by Hack the Hidden Job Market Course.

"description":"Did you know there are jobs shared on Twitter every day? If you know how to look for the jobs you want, Twitter provides you with an opportunity to connect with the person behind the posting. Twitter should be looked at as a real time job search engine and communication channel, says guest expert Chris Russell.\n The best way to search Twitter for jobs is by using keywords and hashtags (#). In the Twitter search bar, simply enter # plus your career field (e.g. #marketing) and then your location to see all the latest Tweets about jobs in your area. Hashtags help filter your results so you only get the tweets that pertain to your query. Also, if you click on a hashtag, you will see all the other Tweets from those who have used your same keyword.\n Recruiters are actively posting jobs on Twitter. A job seeker can even find job boards and save past searches to access search results at a later time.\n Popular hashtags with job seekers and recruiters are:\n  #Job #Jobs #Hiring #Career #JobAlert  Twitter gives you the ability to have a one-to-one, personal conversation with a recruiter representing the company you want to work for. You can use it to rise above your job search competition, to promote yourself as an expert in your industry or to establish your personal brand.\n If you would like to build a relationship with a recruiter on Twitter try:\n  Retweeting their posts Making them a favorite Asking them the best way to apply for a job Being nice  Pro Tip — Don’t ask for a job right away. Start a simple dialogue first!\n Chris Russell Bio\n Chris Russell is the Founder of CareerCloud.com. Widely considered to be the 'mad scientist of online recruiting, Chris has been connecting job seekers to employers since 1999. When he's not running Career Cloud, you can find Chris on his kayak or biking his local rail trail. Chris has provided a list of career tools at tools.careercloud.com, which includes a job board list for every state.\n Ben’s Job Search Resource:\n Ben’s resource this week is Jobvite’s  Recruiter Nation 2016 Annual Social Recruiting Survey. The data and infographics included cover general hiring trends, tips for job seekers and how employers find job candidates. The report was compiled from 1600 different recruiters.\n Jenna’s Find Your Dream Job Listener Question:\n Today’s question comes from Sierra Winegarner who attended our Career Pathways and Doing Good Event. She asks, “Is it OK to have a multiple page resume?”\n *The difference between a resume and a CV is: A resume is roughly one to two pages and a CV includes everything in your professional career.\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question, email it to jenna@macslist.org, or call her at  716-JOB-TALK.

"description":"Can your resume engage a human resource manager and make them want to read more? Or, does it just blend in with all other task-oriented resumes they receive?\n This week’s guest expert Andrea Gerson has seen thousands of resumes, and shares her best practices to help you get the attention of your intended employer. She says, “It can be challenging for people to quantify what they have done, and to brag about their contributions.”\n Most people are encouraged to be humble and not to boast about their accomplishments, but a job seeker can miss out on a great career opportunity, if they don’t properly quantify their competencies and qualify their contributions on their resume.\n Use these resume tips to help you get an interview:\n  Use the primary real estate (top third) of your resume to engage your reader. Add quantitative information about your high-level accomplishments that pertain to the job for which you are applying. Include your goals and intentions, and how they may benefit the prospective company. Add pertinent information in bite-sized pieces, and in concise bullet points. Use the S.T.A.R. Framework, and be consistent when formatting your resume.  You have one chance to make an impact to get the job you want. Make the most of it!\n Andrea Gerson Bio\n Andrea Gerson helps professionals find clarity, confidence, and a renewed sense of energy in their work. Andrea is the founder of Resume Scripter. She has created and edited resumes and cover letters for more than 3,000 people. And, her client’s organizations have included Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, the United Nations, and The Red Cross.\n Ben’s Job Search Resource:\n Ben’s resource this week is from Epic CV’s resume section and is titled  \"10 Pros, 4 Cons and 5 Risks of Graphic Resumes\". 9 out of 10 people do not benefit from a non-traditional resume, but if your job description includes graphic design or creative director, a graphic resume may give you an advantage. If you are applying for a job and you know your resume will go through an automated keyword based system, do not, don’t, never ever and refrain from submitting a graphic resume.\n Jenna’s Find Your Dream Job Listener Question:\n Ben, Jenna and Mac respond to Heath Padgett’s question, “How do you support members of your family while they look for a job?”\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question, email it to jenna@macslist.org, or call her at  716-JOB-TALK.

This brings up an interesting question for job seekers: how much of your own political beliefs should you share online and with prospective employers? How much politics is too much politics?\n This is part of a larger conversation about balancing your values against how those values impact your job search.

"description":"In the past, hiring managers using a telephone to solicit feedback from job references yielded a low, 50% return rate. Today, online reference tools and surveys boast a reference return rate of 85-90%! For job seekers, this makes furnishing quality referrals to potential employers a necessity.\n “Feedback is accumulated by various ways,” says guest expert, Ray Bixler. Metrics evaluated by employers include the number of references a job seeker offers, how long it takes an applicant to enter the reference names and what feedback the references supply. Job seekers can improve their results by being prepared with complete information about their references and entering the information as soon as the prospective employer sends the email.\n Tips for Job Seekers:\n  Meet with your references to ask their permission to use their name and to let them know what is expected of them. Have your references ready in advance, as the reference process is moving ahead in the hiring process; sometimes references are requested before the first interview is granted. Give five references, with at least two being former managers. Fill out an employer’s reference request completely, and as soon as possible after receiving it.  Remember, a prepared reference has time to think about all the great things you have done!\n Ray Bixler Bio\n Ray Bixler is CEO of SkillSurvey, an online reference checking technology firm that helps organizations recruit, hire, and retain talent. Ray has more than 20 years of human resource and career development experience. Ray’s organization has just launched the new solution, Source. Source gives references an opportunity to become applicants with the employer requesting their input.\n Ben’s Job Search Resources:\n Ben’s resource this week is a blog post from Main St entitled  \"5 Job Reference Myths That Can Destroy Your Chances and Reputation.\" The content includes common occurrences job seekers frequently overlook.

"description":"The “glass ceiling” is a concept that a woman who tries to progress in her career may only reach a mid-level position, says guest expert Elisa Doucette. The phrase, “glass ceiling,” denotes that a woman is able to see men, through a pane of glass, in positions above her own, but she is not able to break the glass, to reach a higher level in the organization.  Elisa says corporations have adopted a set of values towards women (or men) who are not willing to put aside their career or personal values and sell their souls, to make money. And although the concept has evolved since the 1970’s, the glass ceiling still exists -- just in a modified form.\n Elisa says corporations have adopted a set of values towards women (or men) who are not willing to put aside their career or personal values and sell their souls, to make money. And although the concept has evolved since the 1970’s, the glass ceiling still exists -- just in a modified form.\n Women need to understand the paradigm and know that corporations aren’t out to get them just because they are a woman. A woman needs to understand what motivates her employer and use actions -- not just words -- to show her value.\n If a woman can show how she will impact the company’s bottom line, she can start owning her own trajectory within the organization.\n Three tips women can use to show their employer how amazing they are:\n  Quantify your accomplishments with hard numbers, to show the value you bring to an organization. Make sure your voice is heard, and be willing to defend your opinions. Understand your priorities, both business and personal.  Move past “What can I do about it?” and start developing your iron will and thick skin!\n Elisa Doucette Bio\n Elisa Doucette is a freelance writer and editor.  Her work has been featured in\n The New York Times, The Boston Globe, Yahoo! Small Business, The Huffington Post, and Brazen Careerist. She runs the online editorial agency, Craft Your Content, and hosts the weekly podcast, Writers’ Rough Drafts. Elisa is also responsible for the syndicated column,  Shattering Glass, on Forbes.com. She can be found on Twitter, @elisadoucette, and on Instagram, @elisa_doucette.\n Ben’s Job Search Resources:\n Ben’s resource this week is a list of 250 Flexible Jobs for 2016, which can be  found at  FlexJobs 250: Companies with the Most Flexible Jobs.

"description":"The days of working for the same company for 30-years and retiring with a full pension are a thing of the past. Today, people have a powerful sense they need to consistently consider what their next career or job change will be. There are even employees who are worried about what hiring managers will think about a long stint at just one company.\n Guest expert New York Times Columnist, Rob Walker, says hiring managers look more for applicable skills or a major red flag than time on job titles. He says it’s important to stay on top of what is available in the job market and to periodically conduct informational interviews so you know what your value is in the marketplace. Checking job boards can also help a job seeker to understand what additional skills they could acquire before they might need to find other employment.\n Keep your resume current if opportunities for growth arise in your current environment. And, be proactive about changes you can make in the workplace.\n Signs it might be time to move on:\n  Issues in Business Sector. Your responsibilities are diminishing. Someone starts taking over your tasks.  If you do get a new job when departing your current company:\n  Follow the rules of the organization. If they request two-weeks notice, give two-weeks notice. Don’t try to settle scores during your exit, no matter how angry you are.  Your skills are valuable! Make sure you know what you are worth.\n Rob Walker Bio\n Rob Walker writes the \"The Workologist\" column for the Sunday business section of The New York Times and blogs for Design Observer.  He’s the author of four books and has written for such publications as Slate.com, New York Times Magazine, Money, and The American Lawyer.

"description":"Did you just land an interview? Congratulations! Now, it’s time to prepare.\n The interview stage is the time to show an organization how you will fit into the culture and how you can solve a company’s problems. It is the first time the organization will see you, hear your voice and get an impression, so make it impactful. Guest expert, Caroline Dowd-Higgins, shares her professional tips on how to land your dream job through great interview techniques.\n Caroline says research before an interview is imperative but it’s something many people fail to do. To prepare, first, print out a copy of the job description, highlight the attributes the company is looking for and write down a compelling story and/or an example of how you embody these points. Using the job description to help the interviewer understand why you are a good fit shows initiative.\n Storytelling Tips:\n  Practice. If you don’t have a specific skill, find something that is relatable. Start with “I’d like to tell you a story.” Make your stories natural and authentic.  Chemistry and culture are a huge part of whether or not an applicant will fit into an organization. Given the amount of time we spend with our work families, it is vital that we not only fit into an organization but fit well. Show your true self during an interview so the hiring manager can get a clear picture of what you will be like at work.\n Pro Tip - Take a video of yourself practicing for your interview. Use appropriate body language. Remember, a strong voice exudes confidence, eye contact makes a connection, and filler words can be eliminated with a little practice.\n And, if for any reason you do not feel you were able to share your skills and abilities completely during the course of the interview, use closing remarks to summarize why you are a good fit for the position.\n Go Get ‘em Tiger!\n Caroline Dowd-Higgins Bio\n Caroline Dowd-Higgins is executive director of career and professional development for the Indiana University Alumni Association.\n She’s the author of the book,  This Is Not the Career I Ordered and she has a new book, Thrive!

Lists are great for the grocery store but if you want to make sure harder tasks are tackled, create a schedule for yourself. One method to create an artificial construct is batching. Batching is restricting blocks of your time for one specific task. For example, batching emails for one hour means you will only read and respond to emails within hour you have blocked.\n Distractions can kill productivity. Social media sites, phone calls, and unplanned interruptions are things we all get distracted by. To reduce the level of distractions during your work time Matt recommends job seekers:\n  Create routines. Familiarity lowers the chance of interferences. Use the Self-Control app to block distracting websites during your work hours. Schedule projects in advance and then follow the daily schedule. Go to a coffee shop with wifi to get away from distractions when working from home.  Schedule a block of time to polish up your resume!\n Matt Kepnes Bio\n Matthew Kepnes runs the award winning budget travel site, Nomadic Matt, and wrote the New York Times bestseller,  How to Travel the World on $50 a Day. After a trip to Thailand in 2005, Matt decided to quit his job, finish his MBA and head off into the world. His original trip was supposed to last a year. Over ten years later, he is still out roaming around and teaching others how to do the same.\n Ben’s Job Search Resources:\n Ben’s resource this week is a free online tool to save job seekers from the embarrassment of typos and grammatical errors. Grammarly can be used online or as a plugin and it identifies over 250 types of writing errors, many of which Microsoft Word doesn’t catch. Grammarly’s versatility allows it to function on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc. when added as a plugin to the Chrome browser.\n Jenna’s Find Your Dream Job Listener Question:\n Ben, Jenna and Mac respond to Kelly G.’s question — “How do I market my soft skills?”\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question, email it to jenna@macslist.org or call her at  716-JOB-TALK. Or if you’ve found a job resource you think everyone should know about, send it to ben@macslist.org and tell him how it has helped you find your dream job.\n These segments are sponsored by the 2016 edition of Hack the Hidden Job Market Course.

"description":"Employers may use phone interviews to save time, get a sense of an applicant’s personality and test their skill level. This phone screening saves an employer time allowing them to weed out those who may not have essential skills needed for the open position.\n Job applicants do not always know when a hiring manager or recruiter will be calling to conduct an interview. If you are caught unprepared or your situation is not ideal to respond to their questions,  it is perfectly acceptable to ask the interviewer to reschedule the call. But, be sure to ask for their number, so the follow-up task belongs to you — not the interviewer.\n Guest expert, Hannah Morgan says it is a good idea to do your homework and research the company and job posting thoroughly before the phone interview. She says it is best to prepare yourself with stories and examples of times you succeeded in completing similar tasks required for the job and focus on the positive outcomes. Use the company’s website to find out about its mission statement and who its customers are. The more you know the more relaxed you will be during the interview. Background research also helps you to prepare a list of questions to help you gain insights about your possible future employer. Pro Tip: Your questions should be different if you are speaking with a manager in the division you wish to work in than if you are speaking with a person in Human Resources.\n Non-verbal body language is important during a phone interview. Try these tried and true techniques:\n  Stand up or walk around during the interview. This opens up your diaphragm and projects your voice. Smile while speaking. It enhances your voice. Don’t talk over the interviewer. Take a moment before answering questions to ensure you don’t interrupt. Dress in business attire. Studies show people feel more confident when they are dressed up.  Always end the conversation with questions about possible timeframes for filling the opening, when you should expect to hear back from the employer and  anything else you don’t want to be left wondering about. Hannah says some job seekers will even end with a trial close. The question “Can you think of any reason why you wouldn’t move me forward in the process?” allows applicants to clarify any possible misunderstandings and to overcome objections.\n Show courtesy and always send a thank you note!\n Hannah Morgan Bio\n Hannah Morgan is the founder of Career Sherpa.net Her talks, blog posts, and books offer no-nonsense, actionable advice to active and passive job seekers.  Hannah writes a weekly column for U.S. News & World Report and is the author of The Infographic Resume, published by McGraw-Hill Education. For additional career-related information follow Hannah on Twitter @careersherpa.\n Ben’s Job Search Resources:\n Ben shares a blog post titled,  Can I Turn Down a Skype Interview and Suggest a Phone Call Instead?, from the Ask a Manager blog which is managed by Allison Green. The article suggests it is OK to request a phone call based on the available technology.\n Jenna’s Find Your Dream Job Listener Question:\n Ben, Jenna and Mac respond to Nathan Brennan’s question — “Is there a good way to respond to an unsolicited salary rate a recruiter presents to you over the phone?”\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question, email it to jenna@macslist.org or call her at  716-JOB-TALK. Or if you’ve found a job resource you think everyone should know about, send it to ben@macslist.org and tell him how it has helped you find your dream job.\n These segments are sponsored by the 2016 edition of Hack the Hidden Job Market Course.

"description":"Do you have a personal website, a personal business card or a folder of compliments you have received? If not, you should, says this week’s guest expert, Michelle Ward of When I Grow Up Coach. A person is more than their current job title. And often, personal projects and hobbies tell more of your story than your job description does.\n If you want to stay in the driver’s seat of your career, you should consistently keep up on what is working for you and any wins you have. Create a separate folder (online or on paper) and add any kudos or accolades you receive throughout the course of a year, and update your resume accordingly. This will save you time and frustration during your annual performance review and you will be ready in the event that an unexpected opportunity arises.\n These resources make it easy to:\n  Track your accomplishments online with Evernote Share information about yourself with About.me Give hiring managers a reason to be interested in you with Branded.me  Michelle also advises job seekers to create an elevator pitch about themselves. You are much more than your field of work. When someone asks you what you do, expound on your job title by adding your skills set. This is extremely useful if you are attending a networking event or conference. Remember, conferences are opportunities for learning and connecting.\n Don’t dread your work!\n Michelle Ward Bio\n Michelle Ward has been offering career guidance for creative women as\n “The When I Grow Up Coach” since 2008. She is the co-author of The Declaration of You, published by North Light Books. Michelle also teaches a class, Create Your Dream Career and Ditch Your Day Job, on CreativeLive.com.\n Michelle is excited to be launching her new program, 90 Day Business Launch at the end of October.

"description":"If the purpose of networking is to build relationships, then why would you only network when you are job hunting? Guest expert, Angela Copeland says it takes time for someone to get to know you, so start networking now. If you are unsure of  where to find information about networking events, Angela suggests to look online for associations or groups in your field of work, contact the local Chamber of Commerce or go to Meetup.com.\n You may feel more comfortable at a networking event that is a good fit for you. It’s advisable to target events where you have a decent chance of meeting people in your field, you can really connect to. Pro Tip — If you are looking to change fields, have business cards made with your contact information, leaving off your current field of work.\n It’s okay if you find professional events awkward and scary, everyone else who is there feels the same way. Angela recommends going to networking events alone and being on the lookout for someone who is also there alone. If a person is deeply engaged in conversation with another person, you are less likely to make an impact if you approach. If you do approach someone, ask them personal questions. Personal questions can open people up and help to form a deeper connection.\n Remember, the person who lands a job is not always the most qualified. It is the person the hiring manager likes the most or has a connection with.\n Networking Event Do’s:\n  Do have a pitch about yourself in case someone asks. Do make a positive first impression through body language, a smile and being properly dressed for the occasion. Do make sure to be pleasant and authentic. Do ask personal questions instead of business questions. Do learn something new. Do follow up with an email or LinkedIn connection with every person you meet.  Networking Event Dont’s:\n  Don’t talk about your job search. Don’t just talk with the person who attended with you. Don’t forget networking and relationship building takes time. Don’t get discouraged if you don’t make a connection at the event.  Shake everyone’s hand firmly and be pleasant!\n Angela Copeland Bio\n Angela Copeland is the CEO of Copeland Coaching. Her firm helps people at all stages of the job search process, including finding the right job, interviewing for a position, and negotiating an offer.\n Angela is the author of Breaking The Rules and Getting The Job. She also hosts the Copeland Coaching Podcast and writes a weekly syndicated newspaper column on careers.

"description":"There is a structure or blueprint to being a successful person but there is no perfect formula. The design differs for everyone, as guest expert Don Hutcheson explains. It is necessary to dig into who you are and what you are supposed to be doing before attempting to be successful at any one thing.\n The first quality all successful people have in common is they take full responsibility for their own self-knowledge and self-awareness, and they avoid mindless conformity. If you start with a solid base of knowing who you are on the inside, you eliminate the guessing which leads to reactions and unsatisfactory career choices.\n Other things successful people have in common is they are all on a lifelong journey of learning, and they surround themselves with like-minded people. They read educational resources about how to use their individual talents and how to strengthen their emotional intelligence. People go through what Don calls “turning points” every 6 or 7 years. If they have a continuous mindset to keep getting better, these turning points will enhance their already honed abilities.\n To be successful:\n  Do research about yourself and your abilities Set goals for yourself Surround yourself with the right people Accept failure and learn from it Be disciplined Trust your instincts Make strategic decisions, not knee-jerk reactions Don’t be miserable Journal about your experiences Seek out people who have the same values!  Book Resources from Don:\n What Should I Do With My Life? by Po Bronson\n What Color Is Your Parachute? by Dick Bolles\n Don’t Waste Your Talents by Don Hutcheson & Dr. Bob McDonald\n Don Hutcheson Bio\n Don Hutcheson is a lifelong entrepreneur, inventor, author and coach. He hosts the daily podcast, Discover Your Talent — Do What You Love and has interviewed over 350 successful people. By the end of 2016, he will be offering membership groups and courses, which will include experts on topics such as emotional intelligence, salary negotiations and exposing natural abilities.  Don has never had a boss. Instead, he has created six companies in advertising, publishing, coaching and career planning over the last 40 years.\n Ben’s Job Search Resources:\n Ben shares the blog post  How to Tell People What You Do—and Be Remembered by Alexandra Franzen on TheMuse.com. The post is about how you can communicate what you do in simple terms, which begins with the Maya Angelou quote “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\"\n Jenna’s Find Your Dream Job Listener Question:\n Ben, Jenna and Mac provide feedback to Sue Black’s question - “Is there a great career coach for young, recent college grads?” Jenna recommends career coach Satya Byock from Quarter-Life Counseling in the Portland area and Stacey Marie Ishmael’s BuzzFeed podcast, Another Round.\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question, email it to jenna@macslist.org or call her at  716-JOB-TALK.

"description":"Did you know 90% of women who opt out of the workforce will return at some point? The most common reason women decide to opt out is to take care of their children, and in the case of the Generation X-ers to care for elderly parents.\n While most companies are keenly aware of the necessities of a family, a woman  who is planning to take a career break should plan for her future. Guest expert, Jennifer Gefsky, advises women to start a log of everything they do during their time off. This planning will make the process of reintroducing themselves into the workforce easier.\n Women do a lot of unpaid work and gain skills, which can be used when transitioning back into the workforce. It’s important to document any work or accomplishments earned in Mom’s groups, in their children's schools or from  volunteering in their communities.\n Tips to make a transition back into the workforce easier:\n  Keep your professional network alive Strategically consider what you want to do Educate yourself towards your passions Dive into your personal networks Learn to brand yourself  The resume gap scares many people. It’s best to own the gap! Don’t explain it away―address it up front because when you show the employer how it can translate back into their business, it won’t need to be justified.\n Do not be afraid to fail!\n Jennifer Gefsky Bio\n Jennifer Gefsky formerly worked as deputy general counsel at Major League Baseball, where she was the highest-ranking woman on the “baseball” side of the business. Jennifer left baseball to raise her three children, and after her career break, she decided not to return to the business of baseball.\n Jennifer co-founded Après, a digital recruiting site that connects high-caliber women, who want to re-enter the workforce, with great jobs. The website is full of information and you can find @AprèsNYC on Twitter and on Facebook at Après.\n Ben’s Job Search Resources:\n Ben shares an amazing online resource this week. Skillshare is an educational site that job hunters can use to acquire additional technical skills. These skills can be used to enhance a current skill set or as a resume filler―to help you get the job you want. There is a cost for courses but many are priced as low as $.99. There are thousands of courses available, along with a global community of learners and teachers who are pursuing work they love.\n Jenna’s Find Your Dream Job Listener Question:\n Ben, Jenna and Mac provide feedback to Erin, from Oregon, on her question - “What is the best way to present her time off to raise her children on her resume and in person? ”\n Watch the Mother’s Job Description Hallmark Video Jenna refers to in the podcast.\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question, email it to jenna@macslist.org or call her at  716-JOB-TALK.

"description":"Keeping a record of career accomplishments is an employee’s own responsibility. If a manager is accountable for ten people, they may not remember the special thing one team member did ten months ago. A person can make it easier on themselves and on their manager by keeping track of their accomplishments, and by letting managers know, specifically, what those accomplishments are. This becomes a powerful tactic when a juicy promotion becomes available.\n Self-promotion and managing your career is part of your career. An employee should want to gain as much as they can during the course of their career, says guest expert Dan Rust. Self-promotional strategies should be genuine, positive and occur during the course of a normal workday.\n Tactics to help you toot your own horn at work:\n  Have a response for your boss when they ask how things are going. Make the most of your annual review. Make them see you sweat, BUT meet your deadlines. Offer to help others and tell your boss about it. Promote others.  The key is to not be anonymous. Make your ideas or insights known, during a conference call or meeting, even if the idea is incomplete. A study found that those who are willing to step forward with an unpopular idea, leave other people with a higher perception of them.\n Furthering your career path is a game you can win!\n Dan Rust Bio\n Dan Rust is the founder of Frontline Learning, a publisher of corporate training resources. He regularly speaks on employee engagement, productivity and career management. Dan is also the author of a new book, Workplace Poker: Are You Playing the Game, Or Just Getting Played?, and more information can be found at his website Workplace Poker.\n Ben’s Job Search Resources:\n Keeping track of accomplishments is useful for many reasons, including resume creation or updates, annual reviews, and for realizing one’s value. Finding the time to pull all of your accomplishments together can be a difficult task in itself.

"description":"Does your manager fail to notice your accomplishments at evaluation time? If so, it is because “managers are busy” says salary negotiation expert Josh Doody. In addition to managing people, managers are also responsible for running the business and making a profit. Many companies only consider giving employees raises during a focal or anniversary period which can be the most politically challenging time for an employee to ask for a raise.\n The best way to get a raise or to maximize your salary is to start by doing your homework. Employees should start building their case for a raise 30-60 days before a review and make the process as easy as possible for a manager.\n To build the best case when asking for a raise you should:\n One:  Have a target salary in mind which is based on your market value.\n  Use online resources such as Payscale.com, Glassdoor.com or Salary.com.  Two:  Put a case together with proof you deserve what you are asking for.\n  Ask for a specific raise amount. Outline the quantitative accomplishments since your current salary was set. Show which activities you have performed and the result they have made to move the business forward. Prepare a list of accolades or social proof from others who have recognized your work.  Three:  Show how you are improving the company and how your results align with the goals of the business.\n When building a case employees should not include reasons which do not carry a positive result for the business such as, buying a new house, kids in college, etc.\n Remember to make the process as easy on your manager as possible!\n Josh Doody Bio\n Josh Doody is an author, consultant, MBA, and engineer who writes about salary negotiation, career management, business, job interviews, and self-publishing.  He is the author of Fearless Salary Negotiation: A Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Paid What You’re Worth. His current focus is in reaching people directly through one-on-one coaching programs and his  Free 7-day course on how to get promoted quickly. You can follow Josh on Twitter @JoshDoody.\n Ben’s Job Search Resources:\n Anyone can use Payscale.com to way to find out what jobs are worth based on job title, location, company and experience. Advantages to using the site are targeted salary research, such as, how your salary compares with others who have the same job title and nuanced information on how individual skills can affect your salary. It also includes a comprehensive compensation review so job perks can also be added to the equation. The site is user-data-driven so you may want to limit the amount of personal information you supply.\n Jenna’s Find Your Dream Job Listener Question:\n Ben, Jenna and Mac provide detailed, honest feedback Shannon Cleary’s situational question - “There is a philanthropic organization that I have applied to 2 jobs to over the last 10 months. I am about to apply for my third. After my last application, I had a phone interview. When I got the rejection email, I replied and asked for time to chat (with my interviewer) or suggestions for things to work on for my next application. I never heard back from her.  So my questions: Should I reach out directly to her and ask for coffee again OR just send in my application as directed by the job post?”\n If you would like the team to answer a job-related question, send it to jenna@macslist.org or call her at  716-JOB-TALK.

"description":"Did you know that your body language is responsible for 60% of your communications and that first impressions are nonverbal? Vanessa Van Edwards, from Science of People, shares some best practices for acing a job interview based on her team’s scientific research.    \n Body language research shows us that the first thing an interviewer sees is called a ‘glance test.’ Humans used to use this first glance to determine if an approaching person was a friend or foe. It is an instinctive response we still use today, even though we may not be aware of it. To make the most out of our time in front of an interviewer Vanessa offers up these tips...\n During a job interview applicants should:\n  Nail the first impression by using expansive body language and making their hands visible. Shake the interviewer’s hand at the beginning and at the end of the interview. Demonstrate competence by aligning your body with the interviewer's body, nod to show you are listening and speak naturally. Use your portfolio or leave behind a document to open up an interviewer's closed body language. End the interview with a lean-in handshake and good eye contact. Walk side by side with the interviewer on your way out of the office.  If you feel like a winner and have a winner’s posture you will come across as a winner!\n Vanessa Van Edwards Bio\n Vanessa Van Edwards is a published author, behavioral investigator, and Huffington Post columnist. Her specialty is science-based people skills. Vanessa runs the Science of People, a Human Behavior Research lab and her unique approach has been featured on CNN, Forbes, NPR, BusinessWeek and in the Wall Street Journal. You can help further Vanessa’s research experiments by visiting the website and clicking on something that interests you.\n Ben’s Job Search Resources:\n The free, online tool Apply Mate is Ben’s job research tool of the week. This tool allows job applicants to enter details about jobs which interest them and the Apply Mate database keeps track of the entire process in an intuitive and useful manner.\n Jenna’s Find Your Dream Job Listener Question:\n Ben, Jenna and Mac provide detailed, honest feedback to answer Haley Twist’s question - “Should job hunters ever consider applying for positions they don’t necessarily want, but are qualified for, to get their foot in the door at a company they really respect?”\n These segments are sponsored by Hack the Hidden Job Market Course, which starts November 1st.

"description":"It pays off to prepare yourself before asking an employer to make your job virtual. Most employers will want to know what’s in it for them before allowing an employee to work from home full-time. A professional way to address your employer’s possible questions and concerns is to make a list of the objections you think they will have, and then build a mini business case around each issue. Showing an employer a value proposition is your quickest way to a yes.\n Employers appreciate when you can show them:\n  How your productivity will be increased How you plan to hold yourself accountable How your creativity may be sparked The absence of workplace distractions Logistical cost savings  When your employer agrees to your proposal of setting up a virtual office, you need to start preparing yourself for success. Melissa says that it is best to be honest with your work style and be sure you can spend long periods alone. Also, you should not consider working from home a substitute for child care. If you want to continue working virtually, you should have other means for your child to be cared for during your work hours.\n With focus and determination, you can do this!\n Resources for virtual office information:\n  Harvard Business Review Blogs Fast Company Mashable Virtual Agency Realities Group on LinkedIn FlexJobs  Melissa Mathews Bio\n Melissa Mathews is the founder and president of The Mathews Group, a strategic communications agency built on an entirely virtual, flex-work model.

A traditional job search includes scouring job postings and identifying with skills an employer is looking for.

"description":"Networking events can be, for an introvert, a worst case scenario. This is why introverts need to be prepared, strategic and have a clear goal of what they want to accomplish before attending a conference or event. Today’s guest expert, Trina Isakson says that introverts gain energy from being alone and a common misconception is to think of introverts as socially awkward or shy.\n In business today, most networking events are designed around the ‘spray and pray’ method of handing out business cards to a copious amount of people. Introverts may see this exercise as a vampire slowly draining their energy levels, both mentally and physically. Trina shares her tips which allow an introvert to make the most out of a conference or live event. And, she reminds us the true goal of networking events should be to build meaningful relationships which add value to our lives and the lives of others.\n Tips for introverts to get the most out of networking events:\n  Attend the same conference year after year The conference topic must be interesting to you Focus energy on building deep and meaningful connections Identify people who can be a beneficial strategic connection Be generous to those who hold less power than you Have a purpose by volunteering for a position at the conference Stay in touch with purpose  Trina stresses that quality contacts matter more than the quantity of contacts you make. Introverts who may feel they are bothering their newly made contacts can maintain a professional relationship with a quick email in place of a meeting.\n Trina Isakson Bio\n Trina is a strategist and researcher who works with nonprofit leaders and social innovators. As founder and principal thinker at 27 Shift, her clients include government, higher education, and national nonprofit organizations.

"description":"A job loss due to layoffs or conflicting interests can be a shock to our system. A person may feel thrilled to be apart from their previous employer at first but a flood of emotions generally follows shortly after. Today’s guest, Career Coach Marsha Warner, shares tips and techniques to transform your first days of unemployment.\n If you find yourself in this situation Marsha advises:\n  Don’t start to market yourself for a new position immediately. Take the necessary time to equalize your emotions. Just breathe. Be prepared to tell your story pragmatically and end it with a statement of moving forward. Friends and family can serve as a much-needed support system.  Only after rectifying your emotions should you align yourself with possible new employers. Statistics from the Department of Labor anticipate each US worker will have six job changes from age 30 to age 55.  Understanding you may find yourself transitioning jobs more than once makes a good case for having a high-level, personal career plan. Taking personal responsibility for your skill set and keeping a larger perspective empowers you when your job search begins.\n Remember to: Stay engaged with your existing networks! Take a class to enhance your skills!   \n Marsha Warner Bio\n Marsha is the owner of Career Factors (www.careerfactors.com). She is a coach, resume writer, and recruiter. Her clients range from college students to senior executives. Marsha is a popular educator and speaker at career events and a frequent contributor to career blogs and podcasts.

"description":"Many job seekers are interested in a nonprofit career as a vehicle for rewarding, socially-impactful work. But landing a nonprofit job isn’t easy. Competition is fierce – particularly for the most desirable positions. And the nonprofit sector itself is sometimes quite insular, with the the most plum jobs going to well-connected candidates.\n Finding a nonprofit job requires a strategic approach, solid networking, and a clear understanding of what you have to offer social impact organizations.\n On February 28, 2016 Mac Prichard, founder and publisher of Mac’s List, explored these issues on the Non Profit Hour, a radio program produced by the Portland-based Media Institute for Social Change. Mac discussed the history of Mac’s List, the unique challenges of finding rewarding work, and his own experience as a job seeker.\n He also shared some of his favorite work-themed music. (Spoiler alert: Mac loves Dolly Parton!)\n In this bonus episode you will learn:\n  Why connection is the key – organizations hire candidates they know trust How to recognize and communicate the value of what you have to offer others Why online job boards are only a small part of the job hunt How hiring is a two way street – for the potential employee and the employer  Thank you for listening to Find Your Dream Job.

Here's a list of best practices for career maintenance that are applicable to everyone.\n\nHe said, \"I wish I'd kept of copy of my performance reviews.\" Lesson: Keep your own file of reviews and accolades. They are helpful to promote accomplishment statement, review for interviews and remind yourself of achievements when doubts creep in.\n\nHe said, \"I wish I'd continued to network and develop outside contacts.\" Lesson: Don't wait until you're unemployed to start networking. Stay in touch with colleagues, classmates, ex-bosses, other parents, fellow volunteers, and so on.\n\nHe said, \"I wish I'd joined LinkedIn earlier on.\" Lesson: Keep your LinkedIn profile active. It's a tool for recruiters, a way to stay connected and a source of information for professional development. Spend at least an hour a week updating your profile, reconnecting, joining interest groups and staying current.\n\nHe said, \"I wish I had not taken it so personally. I let this lay-off really get to me.\" Lesson: When your job ends, take time to mourn the loss and acknowledge your emotions, then let it go. Evaluate the job market, then take up your career toolbox, and go forth. Know that when you're part of a reduction in force, it's a business decision not a personal decision. Take charge of your career with a personal marketing plan. Manage what you can control, and let what you cannot go.\n\nHe said, \"I wish I had reached out and passed on my professional knowledge to younger colleagues before I left.\" Lesson: Teaching is a great source of career satisfaction.

Do you know someone who has the perfect job and is getting well paid too? It might seem that this happened by a stroke of luck. In fact, it has nothing to do with chance. People with dream jobs have clear goals and plans to accomplish them. When you find that job or career, it feels so right it’s like you were born to do it. To get there, you must first choose among what can seem like an overwhelming menu of career options.\n\nThis week on Find Your Dream Job, we’re talking about how to find the work you were meant to do. Ben Forstag has a free online test that can help you get clearer about your goals and your strengths. Jenna Forstrom has a question from a listener who wants to start a business one day but wonders how candid she should be with employers about this. I talk to Christ Guillebeau, author of the new book Born For This: How to Find the Work You Were Meant to Do. Our show is brought to you by our book, Land Your Dream Job in Portland and Beyond. To learn more about the updated edition that we published on February 1st, go to macslist.org/book.\n\nWe’re excited to have Jenna Forstrom, our new Commun", "title":"Ep. 030: Find the Work You’re Meant to Do (Chris Guillebeau)", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script>

"description":"College graduation season is just around the corner and departing seniors will find themselves in a strong job market.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the class of 2016 may experience the best job market ever for Millennials. A survey cited by the Journal says that this year employers plan to increase hiring of new college graduates by 15%.  That’s good news for this year’s new graduates.\n\nBut no matter how low the unemployment rate, you still have to interview successfully to get the job...\n\nThis week on “Find Your Dream Job” we’re talking about what recent college graduates need to know to nail their job interviews. Mac talks to Don Raskin who has written a book aimed at new and recent graduates that shares interview secrets and other tips you can use in a job search no matter where you are in your career.\n\nIn this 35-minute episode you will learn:\n\n\nWhy knowing your key facts (including salary requirements) is key in interviewing\nHow to position yourself in an interview and why you are the best candidate\nWhy knowing your objectives and sticking to them helps focus your job search\nHow to use LinkedIn as part of your pre- and post-interview process\nHow to follow-up after an interview\n\nThis week’s guest:\n\nDon Raskin\nSenior Partner, MME\nAuthor, The Dirty Little Secrets of Getting Your Dream Job\nNew York, NY\n\nListener question of the week:\n\n\nI graduated college in a couple of months, but have done almost nothing to prepare for what comes next.

"description":"Image is an important part of a job search--and career management, in general. You always want to present yourself as a competent, talented and, enthusiastic professional. But it's also important that your brand reflects who you are. Ultimately, authenticity matters more than professionalism. Your brand, no matter how polished and practiced, is worthless if it doesn't reflect your genuine personality.\n\nOn this bonus episode of Find Your Dream Job, Portland-based marketing professional, Brittany Bennet, shares her experience learning the importance of authenticity. She reads \"Get Ahead in Portland by Being Unprofessional\", her contribution to our book, Land Your Dream Job in Portland (and Beyond).\n\nWhile Brittany's comments are specifically about her experience in Portland's casual professional culture, her lesson about being authentic will resonate no matter where you are.\n\nThank you for listening to Find Your Dream Job.

"description":"It is illegal for an employer to discriminate based on age, but many job seekers over the age of 50 will tell you it happens every day. Older workers stay out of work longer and may earn less than in previous jobs when they do return to the workforce. According to AARP the average period of unemployment for people 55 years and older is 54.3 weeks, almost twice as long as the 28.2 weeks younger workers spend job hunting.\n\nThis week on Find Your Dream Job, we explore the challenges of job hunting when you're 50+. Mac talks with Kerry Hannon, a career and personal finance expert who has written extensively on the subject.

First, what do you do best? What are your skills, knowledge and competencies acquired through education and experience of all kids, whether it's employment, volunteer work, life experience and so on? They represent your principle assets in the job market. So, an important part of communicating your value is correctly identifying and labeling these skills. Also, your personal characteristics or adaptive skills are inborn or developed early in life. They can include abilities, talents or predisposition to certain career directions. Third, your accomplishments or the things you've done that you are most proud of.\n\nNext, what do you like to do? Your interest should help shape your professional objective which should be something you are interested in as well as something you are good at. In addition, your values or your core beliefs about what is the most important in life that usually evolves slowly and may change across your life. Next, consider what are your priorities in life. These are your personal preferences or things that might relate to location, schedules and income. Your professional objective should be consistent with your career vision and lifestyle needs. Also, your motivation. Consists of the drivers or needs that propel you along in your chosen career direction such as a sense of accomplishment, the satisfaction of being part of a team or the desire to travel.\n\nNext, where do you fit? Although you may appreciate a good wage, you should also consider many other factors especially when you're working in Portland. First, culture. Do you want a clear line of command or something less hierarchical? Wellness. Does the company offer yoga, encourage noon time runs, discount at gym memberships? Global opportunities. Do you like to travel to the far reaches of the planet or han", "title":"BONUS: Knowing Yourself is the First Step in the Job Search Process (Linda Williams Favero)", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script>

"description":"Most Americans begin work full-time after high school or college and hope to retire at age 65 or older. That doesn’t mean, however, that we remain in the workplace continuously for 40-plus years. Along the way, many of us will stop working outside the home to care for children, parents, or other family members. You may also choose to take time off for yourself, to explore the world, or get clear on what you want from life.\n\nWhatever your reason for putting your career on hold, one day you will likely be ready to go back to work.

"description":"More than 10 million Americans work for nonprofits today. Even the Great Recession couldn’t stop growth in this sector. According to the federal government, the number of nonprofit jobs increased by 18% between 2000 and 2010. And that trend shows no sign of slowing down in the near future.\n\nAnd while the demand for skilled nonprofit workers is huge, it’s often be difficult for established professionals to transition into this sector. It can be a challenge to frame skills developed in the profit world in a way that resonates with nonprofits. Plus, there’s a huge amount of diversity within the nonprofit space.\n\nThis week on Find Your Dream Job, Mac talks with Marcia Ballinger, an executive recruiter for nonprofit organizations and co-author of The 20-Minute Networking Meeting. Marcia shares her tips for how professionals in the private sector can make the jump into a nonprofit career. She believes it’s all about fit; you need to find the type of nonprofit--and a role within that nonprofit--that aligns with your skills, passions, and professional narrative.\n\nIn this 33-minute episode you will learn:\n\n\nWhy so many people want a nonprofit career\nThe multiple paths into the nonprofit sector\nHow to find the best “nonprofit fit” for your professional background\nWhy you need to get specific and focussed in your nonprofit job search\nHow to manage salary and benefit expectations when you move into the nonprofit space\nThe role of passion and values in a nonprofit career\n\nThis week’s guest:\n\nMarcia Ballinger, Ph.D. (@marciaballinger | LinkedIn)\nCo-founder and Principal at Ballinger | Leafblad, Inc.\nCo-author, The 20-Minute Networking Meeting\nMinneapolis, Minn.\n\nListener question of the week: \n\n\nI’m currently hunting for a job in the nonprofit space. I’ve recently saw an opening where the job duties perfectly align with my skills and professional interests; unfortunately I’m not really passionate about the organization’s mission. How should I address the “passion” issue during my interview?\n\nAnswering our question this week is Aubrie De Clerck, principal at Portland-based Coaching for Clarity.

"description":"Among human resources professionals, it is commonly held that at least 85 percent of all resumes “suck.” Most resumes are are poorly written and formatted, and–most importantly–they don’t showcase the candidate’s value to the prospective employer.\n\nWhere does your resume fall? Is it in the mediocre majority or the awesome, “non-sucky” 15%?\n\nOn this bonus episode of Find Your Dream Job, Dawn Rasmussen, president of Pathfinder Writing and Career Services, shares her advice on crafting a resume that stands out, grabs employers’ attention and lands you the interview. Dawn reads from “The Secret Sauce of Kick-Butt Resume”, her contribution to our book, Land Your Dream Job in Portland (and Beyond).\n\nIf you’re looking for more advice on how to stand out as a stellar job candidate, check out Land Your Dream Job in Portland (and Beyond).

The pod cast that helps you get hired, have the career you want and make a difference in life. I’m Mac Prichard, your host and publisher of Mac’s List.\n\nOn today’s bonus episode, we’re sharing exclusive content from our new book, Land Your Dream Job in Portland and Beyond. Land Your Dream Job in Portland and Beyond compiles job search tips and career management tools into one simple easy to read guide. It’s the definitive tool kit for anyone looking for meaningful work. The book also includes special contributions from an array of job search experts and today you’ll hear from one of them.\n\nHere is Dawn Rasmussen, President of Pathfinder Writing and Career Services, reading her contribution, The Secret Sauce to a Kick-Butt Resume.\n\nDawn Rasmussen: \n\nAsk any Portland area human resource manager, recruiter, hiring manager, or headhunter, and believe it or not, he or she will tell you that at least 85% of all resumes suck. I know. I’ve asked them.\n\nThe good news is that there’s really a simple solution to this common problem. It’s all about shifting your perspective. You may think this document is all about you, but the truth is, it’s really about them. Them being the employer who’s reading your document.\n\nWith this staggering statistic in mind, in order to get into the top 10% of awesome resumes, your goal and mission is to start thinking about what you’ve done in the past and start positioning your accomplishments as value. That means not simply including your job duties beneath each employer. You’ve got to do better than that. Now is the time to start keeping track of on-the-job accomplishments. What have you done to make it better? What problems have you solved? How have you helped the company reach its goals? Have you helped make money, save money, or save time?\n\nFear not, you who have not kept track of such important things. Many times the answers to these questions lie in performance reviews, plans of work, staff reports, kudos letters, and many other recaps.\n\nIf you don’t have access to these documents, then your best guess is your best guess, but always be honest and also be conservative. The same thing goes for quantifying your results.\n\nYou should always try to put a number on your accomplishment statements that helps answer the question the employers have been thinking about when reading a candidate’s resume. Based on what this person did for the previous employer, what is he or she going to be doing for me? That’s the secret sauce to a kick-butt resume, when you can win them over with results not fluff", "title":"BONUS: The Secret Sauce to a Kick-Butt Resume (Dawn Rasmussen)", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script>

Careers develop continuously over forty or fifty years of our working lives. They're subject to both internal forces, like family dynamics and changes of interest and external ones like the economy and the local job market. Accordingly, I've always been dubious about mapping out an entire career in advance. The linear progressions of model career development, law school, clerkship, federal prosecutor, night circuit, supreme court, rarely play out so cleanly in real life. I've certainly worked to navigate my career's direction. However, rather than targeting a predetermined destination, I focus on the journey itself. My career plan is less a road map, than it is a set of four practical guidelines. Here they are.\n\n\nDo what you're good at. We've all heard the dictum do what you love. This is great advice if you have strong passions and a clear vision for how to monetize them, but sometimes, the things we love most don't translate into a job that pays the bills. At least, not right away. In these situations, I urge people to focus first on their skills rather than their passions. Do what you do well. Skills can transfer to different jobs, industries and interest. Focusing on professional strengths gives your career flexibility while also eliminating potential avenues to work in the field of your choice. Ultimately, passion and skill are two sides of the same coin. There's a reason you're good at some things and not others. Your skill set is a reflection of the interest and enjoyment you derive from doing those activities. In this sense, doing what you're good is actually a way to do what you love.\n\n\nKeep learning. Taken by itself, the do what you're good at rule could lead to a monotonous and boring career. That's why it's important to stay curious and explore new interests and skills.

The list of changes you want to see in the next 12 months may include a raise, a promotion, and a new job, or maybe you want to improve your professional skills by stepping up your networking, increasing your industry knowledge, or adopting new work habits. Whatever your goal, you're not alone. More than 40% of Americans make New Years resolutions, according to some estimates.\n\nIn spite of those good intentions, however, most of us don't have much success in keeping our promises to ourselves. Researchers at the University of Scranton found that only 8% of Americans achieve their goals. This week on \"Find your Dream Job,\" we're talking about resolutions, why most of them fail, and why those that stick work. We're recording this in January, but the issues that we're talking about and the information we'll share with you today you can use in any month.\n\nOur guest expert this week is Victoria Crispo, who will tell us what people who are successful at keeping their resolutions do differently.

Aubrie is included as one of the local job search experts in Land Your Dream Job in Portland (and Beyond), and in today's episode, she'll share her contribution to the book with you, our podcast listeners.\n\nHere's Aubrie De Clerck reading \"Portland's Threads--and Yours\", from Land Your Dream Job in Portland (and Beyond).\n\nAubrie DeClerck:\n\nIn any search, it's up to us to tell our story: Who we are, what we can do, and how we stand out in doing it. Our story is not simply about identifying transferable skills. To find fulfilling work, we need to communicate our threads, the things we're best at, the things we can't stop doing even if we try, the things we do naturally are gifts in a way that creates confidence in ourselves and shows our value to an employer.\n\nTake Portland as an example. We all know about keeping the city weird, but what is consistent about the town that filters into all the community does? What are Portland's threads? Here are two: unrestrainable creative self-expression, and ongoing commitment to environmental protection. How do we know with confidence that this is truly what Portland is about? If we were writing a resume for Portland, we would give specific examples.\n\nFor unrestrainable creative self-expression, think about our food and drink: Microbreweries, coffee roasters, adventurous, award winning restaurants and farmer's markets. As for the arts, International Film Festival or Jazz Festival, Tango Fest and monthly art walks. Our annual events that include the Bridge Pedal, the PDX Adult Soap Box Derby, Tour de Coops and Time-Based Art Festival. Then our iconic local businesses: Powell's Books, food carts, Hollywood Theater, and Voodoo Doughnuts.\n\nAs for our ongoing commitment to environmental protection, we have compost at the curb. Sixty-three percent of all of our waste is recycled. Investment in public transportation, including our new MAXX Orange Line, strong urban growth boundary, buffer bike lanes, LEED certified buildings and more. With clear examples identified, how do you assign value to them? What do these threads mean about Portland?\n\nTo me, they create a great quality of life and keep our community vibrant, essential components for a city I choose to live in.\n\nAs you create your personal bran", "title":"BONUS: Portland's Threads--And Yours (Aubrie DeClerck)", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script>

When you hear the phrase \"technology sector\" you probably think about multi-million dollar companies like Google, Apple, or Amazon. You don't have to be in Silicon Valley or Seattle to work in tech.\n\nIt's no wonder many people move to these places to work for technology companies, however.

This week on Find Your Dream Job, we're talking about tech jobs. Ben Forstag has an online site you can use to find the highest paying jobs in the sector.

I knew you back in City Government, we were both covering City Government a long long time ago, why did you decide to move into employment and helping people secure their dream jobs?\n\nMac Prichard:   \n\nWell, I went down to Salem after City Hall when you and I worked together, and I after working for the governor and as a spokesman for different state agencies, I took a position with Portland State and I wanted to stay in touch with my colleagues in Salem. We all get job postings, they all cross our desks occasionally, so in order to remain connected with people I just started forwarding the postings I got to a few dozen people in Salem. As the years went by, and Mac's List is a 14 year overnight success, I started hearing from employers I didn't know and people I didn't know who said, \"Add me to your list\". It grew slowly, at the end of eight years we had less than a thousand names but right now we have more than twenty thousand, and we have about eighty thousand people who take advantage, visit Mac's List, the website, the social media accounts, and the newsletter, and the podcasts.\n\nSheila Hamilton: \n\nNow, I noticed your strength seems to be in non-profit and government work, but you're also doing private business now it appears, right?\n\nMac Prichard: \n\nWe are and I think you know, Sheila, I run two small businesses.

"description":"In Find Your Dream Job, Episode 005, the Mac's List team shared the the importance of keeping up-to-date on new social media tools. In this special bonus clip, we discuss one of the newer platforms in social media: Snapchat. Once a domain solely for intrepid youth, Snapchat is now increasingly being adopted by companies and professionals.\n\nCecilia Bianco shares one example of how a nonprofit, DoSomething.org, uses Snapchat, to connect with a younger audience and build a support base.\n\nDo you have a question you'd like us to answer on a future episode?

Today, we were talking about different social media platforms and the topic of Snapchat came up, and maybe I am outing myself as an old guy who doesn't get it, but I really don’t understand the value of Snapchat. I understand how it works, that the pictures self delete, but how could a professional or an organization use this to an effective end?\n\nCecilia Bianco:\n\nYeah, definitely. A lot of organizations are actually using it effectively, and one non-profit in particular has done some really cool things with it. It's called DoSomething.org, and it was Valentine's Day, and they were Snapchatting throughout the day and all of their Snapchats culminated in this live event, and they used Snapchat to get people to come to the event. It's just another way to engage with your fans and if you grow a large audience base on Snapchat, if your audience is in that age group where everyone's on Snapchat, it’s a great way to engage with them and you can do really cool things, like have an all-day online event, and then bring it in person. It's just a new creative way to do something for your fans.\n\nMac Prichard:\n\nThe reason organizations are going to that platform is because that's where their audience is, essentially.\n\nCecilia Bianco:\n\nYeah, I think that's definitely true. Probably from 13 to 23, everyone’s on it. I'm on it, and I don't even know why, but I know I follow a lot of organizations and I can see what they're doing, what campaigns they're working on, and it’s a very personal approach, I think, to social media.\n\nBen Forstag:\n\nHey, Mac? Thirteen to 23, I'm not in that demographic group.\n\nMac Prichard:\n\nNeither am I, but I think a lot of our listeners want to work with young people and they want to work with organizations that are involved, or help and serve young people, and I think it may be a different platform, but the principle's the same, whether it's Facebook or Snapchat. If the employers you want to hire you are in that world, it’s to your advantage to be there.\n\nCecilia Bianco:\n\nYeah.\n\nBen Forstag:\n\nYou go where the market is.\n\nMac Prichard:\n\nExactly, and you don’t have to be 13 to 23 to want to work with young people. There are lots of people my age or younger or older who want to do that kind of work, and being on Snapchat could help them build relationships.\n\nCecilia Bianco:\n\nYeah, it's probably more like 13 to 30, actually, just to correct myself, because I’m thinking of my sisters and my cousins, and they're in their 30s. They'd be offended if they heard me say 23, so 13 to 30.\n\nBen Forstag:\n\nUnfortunately, I still don’t fall in that demographic group! But thanks for clearing that up for me.\n\n \n\n ", "title":"BONUS: How Can Professionals Use Snapchat?", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script>

We're the podcast that helps you get hired and have the career you want, and make a difference in life. I'm Mac Prichard, your host. I'm the publisher of Mac's List. On today's show, we're discussing how to work with an executive recruiter.\n\nLooking for a job is hard work. You know that. We've all been there. Before you set on to your first application or you go to an interview, you need to confirm your career goals, and you have to update your online profiles. You need to network. You need to do lots and lots of networking.\n\nAgain, that's a lot of hard work. Not surprisingly, many of us, including me, have wondered, \"Isn't there another way--an easier way--that lets you cut to the front of the application line?\" What if you could get in front of a recruiter, somebody who is paid to find great employees? Like a fairy godmother, couldn't a recruiter make your wish for a dream job come true, and by doing so save you a lot of time and effort?\n\nRecruiters can make a big difference in your job search, but they can't do it all. This week, we're talking to a recruiter, Steve Potestio. He's one of the best in the business. He works with digital firms and writers, graphic designers, and other creative workers all across the country. Steve is going to share with us what recruiters can do and what they can't do, and how you can make the most of that experience.\n\nFirst, let's check in with the Mac's List team. Joining me as always in our downtown studio here in Portland, Oregon are Ben Forstag, our management director, and Cecilia Bianco, our community manager. Hello Ben and Cecilia.\n\nCecilia Bianco:\n\nHi Mac, how are you?\n\nBen Forstag:\n\nHi Mac.\n\nMac Prichard:\n\nGood, I'm doing well. Confess, have you had that fantasy that the phone is going to ring one day, and it will be a recruiter offering you your dream job?\n\nBen Forstag:\n\nDuring my last unemployment stint, which was about four months long, I had that fanta", "title":"Ep. 005: Finding Work Through Recruiters and Recruiting Agencies (Steve Potestio)", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script>

"description":"Being a professional no longer necessitates going to an office every day. People are increasingly able to work remotely, using telecommunications technologies to stay connected with their companies and colleagues. This trend is happening in nearly every industry sector--even fields like healthcare and education.

"description":"Fifty years ago, it was common for workers to have the same job (or stay with the same company) from graduation until retirement. Today, the average American will have seven to ten different jobs in their lifetime. This volatility in employment has created more uncertainty--but also more opportunity--for career-minded professionals. The secret to thriving in this job market is successful career management: being focused, knowing your goals, and marketing your skill set.  \n\nIn this episode of Find Your Dream Job Mac speaks with career advisor and author Dawn Rasmussen. Dawn contends that “job security is dead” and that the key to professional success lies in improving your job marketability. She shares her tips on having a clear vision for your career, keeping your skills up-to-date, and adroitly marketing your transferable skills.\n\nIn this 30-minute episode you will learn:\n\n\nHow to discover your professional purpose and what you do best\nHow to change careers by breaking down your transferable skill sets\nThe habits of successful career managers\nHow to overcome the fear of a career change or job search\n\nThis week’s guest:\n\nDawn Rasmussen (@DawnRasmussen)\nPrincipal, Pathfinder, Writing and Career Services\nAuthor of Forget Job Security\nPortland, Ore.\n\n \n\nListener question of the week: \n\n\nHow can I transition from the for-profit sector into the nonprofit sector?\n\nDo you have a question you’d like us to answer on a future episode?

Every week we bring you the career tools and tips you need to get the job you want.\n\nNow according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics the typical American changes jobs every 4.1 years. With most of us working well into our 60s that means you may have 10 or more employers in your lifetime, and you'll not only change jobs but careers too perhaps up to seven times some experts say. None of this comes as surprise to our guest today, Dawn Rasmussen. She says job security is dead and what matters now is employability and knowing how to manage your career.\n\nDawn is president of Pathfinder Writing and Career Services, a company that provides resume, cover letter, and job search coaching services.

"description":"It's a fact: employers hire candidates that they know and those who are recommended to them by people that they trust. That's why networking is so important: it gets you face-time with fellow professionals and kickstarts relationships that get you known in the community.\n\nWhen you're looking for a job, one of the best things you can do is conduct informational interviews with professionals in your desired field. But how do you find the right people with whom to meet? And what are the takeaways you can expect from these meetings\n\nIn this episode of Find Your Dream Job Mac talks with Nathan Perez, an executive recruiter and writer who has mastered the art of networking. According to Huffington Post, Nathan is one of the most connected people on LinkedIn, with 30,000 professional contacts. He is also the author of The 20-Minute Networking Meeting, a primer on how to conduct successful informational interviews.   \n\nIn this 36-minute episode you will learn:\n\n\nHow to structure a short but effective networking meeting\nHow to make a good impression in an informational interview\nHow to build and leverage your network\nThe one thing you should never do in a networking meeting\n\nThis week's guest:\n\nNathan Perez (@NathanAPerez)\nPrincipal, 20 Minute Communications\nAuthor of The 20 Minute Networking Meeting\nMinneapolis, Minn.\n\n \n\nListener question of the week:\n\nWhat do I do when a professional connection \"ghosts\" (disappears) on me?\n\nDo you have a question you'd like us to answer on a future episode?
