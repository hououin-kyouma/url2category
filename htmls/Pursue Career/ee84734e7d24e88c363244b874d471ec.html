            <p class="col-md-8 col-sm-12" style="margin-top:10px;">I worked as part of the Analyst Team, a central team of finance analysts that support Line Finance for each of the advisors (e.g. Equity, Fixed Income, etc.). During my time with the team, I had two distinct priorities. First, I worked closely with Analyst Team Members, Line Finance, and our reporting team in Westlake, TX to develop an updated management fee revenue model to forecast future management fee revenue earned by our mutual funds. Leveraging the knowledge I had gained of how Asset Management generates revenue, I was also tasked with supporting Asset Managements Department of Labor (DOL) analysis as part of an enterprise wide finance team to develop analysis identifying the impact of the regulation on AMs future revenue. <br><br>Financial modeling was a key element of my rotation. From building a detailed revenue model with appropriate documentation for future users, to developing a model to support understanding the financial impact of the DOL ruling on AM, I was constantly fine-tuning my Excel skills and working with data from various sources across the firm. Working on both the revenue model and the DOL modeling provided me with high-level exposure  both in AM and also across Fidelity finance through my DOL work. This rotation  especially with the DOL element  was definitely a highlight of my time during the FLP. Not only was I better able to understand how truly interconnected each of the business units are, but also I gained a true appreciation for how important communication is among finance teams throughout the firm. </p>

            <p class="col-md-8 col-sm-12" style="margin-top:10px;">My rotation required me to perform pricing analysis for the RIA and Bank Trust segments. Pricing is a critical function in FI and team served as an important partner to the business. During my time I had the opportunity to price numerous deals and work on important projects such as re-setting rack rate pricing for the Retirement segment. <br><br>My responsibilities varied on a daily basis and were based on the business goals at that time. The deals ranging in size from ~20M in assets to ~100B in assets and as the size of the client grew the complexity of the deal would as well.

When a PI representative meets with a client at a branch, certain expenses are incurred related to that interaction and consequently future expenses and revenue are generated as that client begins to deposit assets into their Fidelity accounts. My project was to develop a new model to track the true profitability of these interactions and then identify certain representative and client profiles based on the outcome. <br><br>Through the modeling process I worked with business partners and the PI Finance organization to suggest new approaches to understanding profitability. Under this new approach my resulting model provided greater clarity into client profitability and flows while also proving that the rep interactions generated much higher client profitability than previously assumed.

				<p class="col-md-8 col-sm-12" style="margin-top:10px;">I worked as part of the Analyst Team, a central team of finance analysts that support Line Finance for each of the advisors (e.g. Equity, Fixed Income, etc.). During my time with the team, I had two distinct priorities. First, I worked closely with Analyst Team Members, Line Finance, and our reporting team in Westlake, TX to develop an updated management fee revenue model to forecast future management fee revenue earned by our mutual funds. Leveraging the knowledge I had gained of how Asset Management generates revenue, I was also tasked with supporting Asset Managements Department of Labor (DOL) analysis as part of an enterprise wide finance team to develop analysis identifying the impact of the regulation on AMs future revenue.
					<br/><br/>Financial modeling was a key element of my rotation. From building a detailed revenue model with appropriate documentation for future users, to developing a model to support understanding the financial impact of the DOL ruling on AM, I was constantly fine-tuning my Excel skills and working with data from various sources across the firm. Working on both the revenue model and the DOL modeling provided me with high-level exposure  both in AM and also across Fidelity finance through my DOL work. This rotation  especially with the DOL element  was definitely a highlight of my time during the FLP. Not only was I better able to understand how truly interconnected each of the business units are, but also I gained a true appreciation for how important communication is among finance teams throughout the firm.

The deals ranging in size from ~20M in assets to ~100B in assets and as the size of the client grew the complexity of the deal would as well.

First, I worked closely with Analyst Team Members, Line Finance, and our reporting team in Westlake, TX to develop an updated management fee revenue model to forecast future management fee revenue earned by our mutual funds. Leveraging the knowledge I had gained of how Asset Management generates revenue, I was also tasked with supporting Asset Managements Department of Labor (DOL) analysis as part of an enterprise wide finance team to develop analysis identifying the impact of the regulation on AMs future revenue. <br><br>Financial modeling was a key element of my rotation. From building a detailed revenue model with appropriate documentation for future users, to developing a model to support understanding the financial impact of the DOL ruling on AM, I was constantly fine-tuning my Excel skills and working with data from various sources across the firm. Working on both the revenue model and the DOL modeling provided me with high-level exposure  both in AM and also across Fidelity finance through my DOL work.

				<p class="col-md-8 col-sm-12" style="margin-top:10px;">I was tasked with improving Workplace Investings (WI) annual forecasting process during my Financial, Planning, and Analysis rotation.  WIs annual net flows represents both plan sponsor and participant activity across both Fidelity and non-Fidelity funds.  Given the dynamics and materiality of these flows to stakeholders across Fidelity, I was given the opportunity to refresh and improve the WI flows forecasting process, models and infrastructure to provide better insight to the WI CFO and WI Senior leadership team, as well as improving alignment with various stakeholders across Fidelity.
					<br/><br/> The success of this project heavily relied upon quickly gaining subject matter knowledge in our WI recordkeeping business.  I was able to develop strong relationships with members of the WI Finance, Sales, and Relationship Management teams in order to better understand the recordkeeping business and existing forecasting process.  I was able to strengthen my analytic and modeling capabilities due to the complexity of client and participant behavior and market action which drives flows.  Overall, I derived a significant amount of value from this rotation which increased my institutional knowledge, broadened my network within the firm, and enhanced my financial modeling skills.

Sponsors are senior Finance leaders who serve as the associates mentor and manager throughout the program. The sponsor guides the selection of assignments, provides business insight, feedback and coaching </p> 
      <p style="margin-bottom:15px; margin-top:13px;"> <span style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;;">Development &amp; Training:</span> Fidelity Finance hosts a series of day-long conferences, breakfast meetings and trainings, many of which are unique to the FLP. These events are designed to broaden each associates understanding of Fidelitys businesses and prepare them for a leadership role in Finance. FLP associates also have the opportunity to get involved in the on-going support of the program through taking a leadership role in the program's recruiting efforts and planning leadership series with senior business leaders from across Fidelity. These tasks provide FLP associates with the opportunity to help structure the program and learning opportunities throughout their tenure in the program.</p> 
      <p style="margin-bottom:14px;"> <span style="font-size:18px;font-weight:bold;">Team Project:</span> The team project provides an opportunity for 1st year FLPs to collaborate and gain additional exposure to a business unit beyond their four rotations. The project also allows a business unit to address an important challenge/opportunity and explore ideas outside of the normal workflow. While learning from one another and strengthening their finance skills, the team project drives decision-making and promotes innovative thinking within the business. The team project is led by a 2nd year FLP providing additional opportunities for associates to develop team and project management skills. </p>

        <p style="margin-top:10px;">As the project lead, I was responsible for sourcing, planning and managing the team project. Over the course of six months, we worked closely with the product, pricing and technology groups to deliver a product level P&amp;L and an updated pricing strategy based on our market research, competitive analysis, and the profitability goals.</p> 
        <!--<p>The opportunity to be a project lead allowed me to develop in 3 key areas:</p>

			<p style="margin-bottom:2px;">2. Project planning </p>
			<p>3. Management skills </p> --> 
        <p>This project allowed me to improve my planning and management skills in a controlled environment, while also contributing to an important initiative and gaining exposure to senior leaders. Ultimately, the leadership role and experience I gained were instrumental to my career development, as I leveraged the work to earn a full-time position within the Fidelity Clearing and Custody Solutions (FCCS) pricing team.</p>
