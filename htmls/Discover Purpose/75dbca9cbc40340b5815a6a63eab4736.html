	The Soul-Directed Life is a unique interactive radio show. It is the first to combine three essential elements to help you tune out the noise of the world and hear the call of your own soul. Each month is devoted to a particular theme—such as “the call to go inside” or “the call to create.” Every week Janet Conner and her guests will share how they heard their soul calling and answered. To help you hear and answer your own unique yet similar calls, Janet and her guests will suggest topics and questions for deep soul writing. The month will wrap up with a group discussion of a book that captures the essence of the month’s theme. These are the soul-stirring books that belong in your permanent library.
	&nbsp;

	Join Janet each week&nbsp;for inspiring stories, practical information, deep soul writing prompts, and great reading recommendations. Then watch with joy as you, too, find the clarity and confidence to create your own Soul-Directed Life.

               <a href="http://banafsheh.org/">Banafsheh Sayyad</a> and 
               <a href="http://www.andrewharvey.net/">Andrew Harvey</a> fell in love over Rumi’s ecstatic poetry. She is Iranian-born master dance artist who fuses Sufi mysticism with the Divine Feminine in dance. He is a living mystic and voice of Sacred Activism. Together they explore the question, “How can we live life as a sacred dance?” (Note: there will be Rumi poetry in Persian!)

               <br> &nbsp;
               <br> Every year our host reads a few books that move her so strongly that she becomes an evangelist for them. In 2016, 
               <a href="http://satyana.org/">William Keepin’s</a> 
               <em>Belonging to God</em> was one of those. Keepin’s premise is that divine love is fractal. That means it is indivisible, holographic, and foundational. Just as fractals follow the quantum laws to create our universe, divine love is present in all spiritual traditions, creating a wildly diverse Oneness. It’s not an accident that one week after William Keepin was on the show this past year, our host received The Nine Containers of Love. Join Janet and William for a deep dive into the fractal nature of divinity and the universe.

I’m not a beekeeper … But then, I opened it and I haven’t put it down since. I may never. Because the bees have given us, through Jacqueline, a profound mystical treatise. This is a book to read in Lectio Divina, consuming and digesting just a few sentences at a time. Join us for bee insights into sound, scent, light, and more. Your eyes and your heart will open forever.

               <br> When

               <em>The Soul-Directed Life</em>&nbsp;this past December, he talked about the three-soul teaching of Hale Makua, a Kahuna shaman from the lineage of Hawaiian kings. I asked Hank to please come back and talk at length about Hale Makua, who comes to life in Hank’s 2011 classic, 
               <em>The Bowl of Light</em>. Makua’s teachings are a revelation. So profound. So deep. So true. When Hank Wesselman speaks, Hale Makua is present. 
               <em>Present</em>. Come prepared for Light!

               <br> My writing office is so sacred, I call it my “writing chapel.” But how do you sanctify a room or garden? For that, I turned to a tradition that sees and honors the sacred in all things: the ancient tradition of faery witchcraft. 
               <a href="http://faerywolf.com/">Storm Faerywolf</a> has been practicing the magical arts for more than 30 years. He joins us to share the wisdom in his new book, 
               <em>Betwixt and Between,</em> about how to create personal sacred spaces that lift our hearts and open our beings to the sacred mysteries.&nbsp;

               <br> When we hear “sacred space,” we tend to visualize 
               <em>external</em> spaces such as altars and temples. But before we can sanctify the space around us, we must sanctify and connect with the power 
               <em>within</em>. Our guide for this internal exploration of our 
               <em>Caves of Power</em> is the world-renowned Mexican healer, 
               <a href="http://xn--sergiomagaa-beb.com/">Sergio Magaña</a>. Sergio was initiated in the Toltecayotl, the Nahua lineage of ancient Mesoamerica. We won’t just talk about these Mexican healing traditions—we will experience a few!&nbsp;

               </div> I offer an astrology forecast every Epiphany. This year I invited 
               <a href="http://www.dreaminginterpretation.com/">Michael Lennox</a> to give us a peek into the wisdom of the stars for 2017. Well! Not only did he explain the wild roller-coaster ride we experienced in 2016—and the continuing chaos in 2017—but he also gave us the solution. Ten guesses what we must have in place for the next nine years? Prayer—a daily, powerful, practice of prayer. But what kind of prayer will hold us upright in the storm? That’s the big question I want to ask Michael.&nbsp;

               <a href="http://www.contemplative.org/cynthia-bourgeault/">Cynthia Bourgeault</a> writes is a revelation. 
               <em>The Heart of Centering Prayer</em> is a double revelation. First, she demonstrates that centering prayer is far more than a Christianized form of meditation. But then, she enters the 
               <em>heart</em> of centering prayer to show what actually happens when we pray this way: Our mind switches to a new operating system—a nondual operating system. And—here’s the really exciting part—this is exactly what the anonymous author of 
               <em>The Cloud of Unknowing</em> was talking about!&nbsp;

               <br> When I asked Andrew Harvey who he recommended for the First&nbsp;Container of Love, he said, “Go to 
               <a href="http://banafsheh.org/">Banafsheh Sayyad</a>’s website!” I did. I sat stunned watching the most glorious videos of ecstatic mystical dance I’ve ever seen. Banafsheh couldn’t be with us in January because she went to Washington, D.C., for the Women’s March, but the Second&nbsp;Container may be an even better space for her, as she invites us to 
               <em>experience</em> the Sama. Join us as we move our human-divine bodies in rhythm with the Beloved within!&nbsp;

               <em>Big Question: What beauty am I now carrying in my heart?</em>
               <br> &nbsp;
               <br> For weeks leading up to the election, I had nightmares about being stalked. I woke the morning of November 9 in shock. My whole body reeled as I watched America appear to choose hate over love, exclusion over inclusion. I begged Sophia for help. That night I had an intense 12-hour dream. At the end of the dream I was handed a playing card, the 1 of Hearts. I knew I was being asked to create a 
               <a href="http://janetconner.com/1heart/">global</a> community to shower Washington with unconditional divine love to feed the voice of love in "We the People" and protect the vulnerable. I contacted Mirabai Starr and John Welshons to ask them to launch this global community of prayer with me. Join us for a deep meditation to awaken the light within and send it to Washington. The prayers of love and healing begin today!

               <br> 
               <br> I read more than 100 spiritual nonfiction books a year. Each year, I find 10 at most that speak to me at such a deep level that I turn into an evangelist for their message. 
               <a href="http://www.pathofdivinelove.org/wp1/"><em>Belonging to God</em></a> is one of those books. In fact, I have placed it on my “essentials” shelf. Nestled among Hafiz, Rumi, Meister Eckhart, and John O’Donohue, William Keepin will be a primary resource for my spiritual life and my books from now on. I’ve long loved the intersection between science and spirituality. From the moment I first saw photographs of fractals in the 1980s, my heart told me “this is important.” But only reading William Keepin, did I finally understand what my heart always knew. If you listen to just one conversation on 
               <em>The Soul-Directed Life</em> this year, let it be 
               <em>Belonging to God</em>. &nbsp;

I heard that Agni Jaya Charlotte Starfire was opening a Women’s Spiritual Empowerment group. I had no idea who she was or what that meant, but I showed up in my pinstriped suit. That night a door into the mystic opened and beckoned me to begin the rich inward journey to my personal sun—the Divine Feminine. Join Agni Jaya and me in a personal conversation about how we recognize and honor the Faces of the Mother! &nbsp;&nbsp;

               <a href="http://www.sandraingerman.com/">Sandra Ingerman</a> is one of the most beloved shamanic teachers on the planet. She’s the author of eight books including 
               <em>Awakening to the Spirit World</em>, 
               <em>Walking in Light</em>, and 
               <em>Soul Retrieval</em>. In her new book and the focus of our conversation, 
               <em>Speaking With Nature</em>, Sandra helps us awaken to the deep wisdom abiding in Mother Earth in her rocks, her plants, her trees, her animals, her sand, soil, and water. If you are looking for your personal “sun,” your primary source of wisdom and love, there’s no better place to begin than Gaia.

                <br> Three years ago Mirabai Starr declared, “You must become friends with death,” on this show. I took it as a personal command and have explored the relationship of life and death ever since. A wonderful place to start is with the phenomena of near-death experiences. People who return from death are transformed. They see and feel and hear what we, who have not touched that threshold, do not. But can we?&nbsp;
                <a href="http://linnministries.org/">Sheila, Dennis and Matthew Linn</a>&nbsp;have explored the depth of NDE. And they’ve written an essential book,&nbsp;
                <em>The Gifts of Near-Death Experiences: You Don’t Have to Die to Experience Your True Home.&nbsp;</em>You do not have to die to reap the benefits of an NDE! You can create a spiritual practice that helps you catch the “benign virus” of an NDE. If you want to live, practice dying!

               <a href="http://www.soundstrue.com/store/tami-simon-5607.html">Tami Simon</a>, who nurtured not only her creative gift but 
               <em>all</em> our possibilities when she founded Sounds True. Tami has interviewed hundreds of spiritual teachers for Sounds True. In our June book club selection,&nbsp;
               <em>The Self-Acceptance Project</em>, Tami helps us answer burning questions: Why is it so much easier to offer compassion and forgiveness toward others than toward ourselves? Where do our self-critical voices come from? How do we stop judging ourselves? Imagine how creative you could be living from a place of complete self-acceptance.

Yes, four. He’ll teach us the four purposes, give a live demonstration of his life path number system, and help us see the plan in our own crazy zigzag career paths. Plus, Janet will introduce the new circle for the year: The Life Cycle of Nature and Creativity.&nbsp;This is the year of the double divine feminine—and it begins with opening to possibility in all four purposes of life.

               <br> It doesn’t seem possible, but we have walked the Medicine Wheel for a full year, traveling through the four directions and seasons, and responding to the energy and wisdom Sun Bear and Wabun Wind describe so beautifully in 
               <em>Dancing With the Wheel</em>. It is my great joy to invite my first teacher, Charlotte Starfire, to be with us on this last show of the year. Charlotte apprenticed with Sun Bear and OhShinnah Fast Wolf. Charlotte built the Medicine Wheel at the Kashi Interspiritual Ashram where we just held our Soul-Directed Life 2015 retreat. She will speak in depth about her life with the wheel, and we will both share our personal prayers of the seven directions. Come, celebrate, and honor the wheel!&nbsp;&nbsp;

               <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Tarosophy">Marcus Katz</a> has been working with and teaching tarot for&nbsp;more than 30&nbsp;years. He was the first student to gain a master's in western esotericism from the University of Exeter. He cofounded the 
               <a href="http://www.tarotassociation.net/">Tarosophy Tarot Association</a> with Tali Goodwin in 2009. He and Tali have a new book, 
               <em>Secrets of the Waite-Smith Tarot: The True Story of the World’s Most Popular Tarot</em>. We’ll talk about how to consult the tarot for guidance and I’ll ask him to do a short reading on air! Plus, he’ll share newly revealed stories about the artist behind the tarot, Pamela Colman Smith.

               <a href="http://www.matthewfox.org/">Matthew Fox’s</a> breakthrough teachings on Meister Eckhart got him in big trouble with the Catholic Church for honoring the divine feminine and creation spirituality. He was the first to speak of Original Blessing—not original sin. Matthew is a beacon of light on the path to reawaken mysticism and protect Mother Earth. He is reinventing education and restoring spiritual practice to its mystic heart in the Cosmic Mass. Imagine my delight when the first book I discovered on honoring the sacred masculine was Matthew’s 
               <em>The Hidden Spirituality of Men</em>. Thanks to Matthew, it need be hidden no more.

               <a href="http://www.margaretstarbird.net/">Margaret Starbird</a> speak in 2011. As she told the story of Mary Magdalene—
               <em>the tower</em>—and how the church suppressed her role as the Bride for&nbsp;2,000 years, my world shifted beneath my feet. I sat on the edge of my seat as Margaret went through slide after slide of medieval paintings and tapestries that clearly bear the symbols, colors, and codes for the archetypal bride. I bought every book Margaret had with her. I read them and reread them, and recently, I read them again. In this conversation, Margaret will discuss her famous book, 
               <em>The Woman With the Alabaster Jar,</em> but also what Gematria, the ancient art of coding words with numbers, can tell us about who Mary Magdalene was. This will be a rich conversation and the perfect culmination of a month honoring the sacred feminine.

               <br> You’ve read 
               <a href="http://www.rabbirami.com/">Rabbi Rami Shapiro’s</a> “Roadside Assistance for the Spiritual Traveler” in 
               <em>Spirituality &amp; Health </em>magazine for years. You’ve listened to his&nbsp;Unity Online Radio&nbsp;show, 
               <em>How to Be a Holy Rascal</em>, and his new 
               <em>Spirituality &amp; Health </em>podcast, 
               <em>Essential Conversations</em>. And you’ve read many of his books. He’s famous for his modern, evocative translations from the ancient Hebrew. He joins us to talk about his new translation of "The Song of Songs" in 
               <em>Embracing the Divine Feminine</em>. Is "The Song of Songs" an ancient love poem? A metaphor of God’s love for his people? The secret story of Mary Magdalene? Join us as we dive into the ancient Hebrew with a scholar, self-proclaimed 
               <em>luftmensch</em>, and beloved Holy Rascal.

               <em>Old Friend From Far Away</em>. Natalie is also an accomplished painter, displayed in shows and prominent collections around the country. Our conversation focuses on

               <em>painting, writing and the bones of seeing.</em> You’ll be seeing the world with new eyes after this conversation!

               <br> 
               <br> Diversity—Why am I here and what is my purpose?
               <br> Interiority—Who am I and who is the self?
               <br> Communion—How do I live and how do I die?
               <br> 
               <br> The questions don’t get any bigger than that! Dr. Klotz joins us from his home in Scotland to share ways to practice the Presence of the divine feminine, Hokman-Holy Wisdom-Sophia, and body prayer from 
               <em>I AM: The Secret Teachings of the Aramaic Jesus</em> CD set.

               <em>The Call to Practice the Presence </em>
               <br> 
               <br> We begin our walk around the Medicine Wheel in the stillness of the North and silence of Winter where our souls hear the subtle call to practice the Presence. Episcopalian priest and mystic 
               <a href="http://www.contemplative.org/">Cynthia Bourgeault</a> has a profound connection with the season of winter and the call of Presence. Twenty winters ago, she left everything she had to live near a hermit monk, teacher, and soul mate in Colorado. Her book 
               <em>Love Is Stronger Than Death</em> is the richest, strangest, most beautiful love story I’ve ever read. Join us for a deep conversation on the living presence of love that continues after death.

               </div> The Call to the Practice of Prayer—Book Club Discussion
               <br> 
               <br> 
               <a href="http://www.andrewharvey.net/">Andrew Harvey</a> is a wild and glorious lover—lover of Rumi, of mystics, of diverse spiritual practice, and of sacred activism. He is a lover of the Sacred Mother and of course, he is a lover of prayer. If you’ve ever heard Andrew speak, you know you have been touched by the heart of the Beloved. In 
               <em>Light the Flame</em>, our Soul-Directed Life Book Club selection for August, Andrew gathers 365 short but heart-thumping prayers from Thomas Merton to Cesar Chavez to Swami Vivekananda to the Prophet Muhammad. We aren’t just talking in this episode, we’re praying!

               <br> I first encountered 
               <a href="http://www.phyllistickle.com/">Phyllis Tickle</a> as the founding editor of the Religion Department for 
               <em>Publishers Weekly</em>, and I’ve longed to speak with her ever since. Phyllis is a true authority on religion in America. She is the author of&nbsp;more than&nbsp;three dozen books, but perhaps best known for 
               <em>The Divine Hours</em> series on fixed-hour prayer. We talk about how Christian fixed-hour prayer relates to the call in Islam to pray five times a day, if the call to prayer is universal or unique to particular traditions, and how she prays as a lay Eucharistic minister and lector in the Episcopal Church.

               <br> 
               <br> As a teenager, Mirabai Starr lived at the Lama Foundation, a spiritual community that has honored all the world’s faith traditions since 1967. There, she encountered Hindu, Buddhist, Sufi, Native American, and many other prayer traditions. This ecumenical grounding blossomed into teaching world religions, translating mystics like Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross, and her latest book 
               <em>God of Love: A Guide to the Heart of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam</em>. We have a juicy conversation about her experiences with prayer, what she learned from praying in so many traditions, why Shabbat is essential, and how the SBNR (spiritual but not religious) can pray and pray with joy.

               </div> Karen Maezen Miller is a wife, mother, and writer. She’s also a Zen priest and teacher at the Hazy Moon Zen Center in Los Angeles. One afternoon in the summer of 1997 she and her new husband found themselves in the neglected backyard of a rundown house in a quiet suburb of Los Angeles. They were standing in a 100-year-old Japanese garden, the oldest privately owned Japanese garden in California. They heard “the call to the garden,” turned to the realtor and said, “We’ll take it!” And then the garden began to teach. Karen’s exquisite new book,
               <em> Paradise in Plain Sight</em>, is the result.

After the show, I told Daniel he was welcome to come back and he said, “How’s February?!” When I asked him what he wanted to talk about, he said beauty because all his poems are, at their heart, the call to beauty. Daniel is traveling unexpectedly and can’t be with us live, but not to worry, he is sending his collaborator Nancy Barton, and Dr. Neale Lundgren, who has written songs for some of Daniel’s translations. The airwaves will be filled with beauty!

               </div> Jan Bartelstone has been a seeker of the divine all his life. For him, creative writing, photography, and filmmaking are channels of the divine as well as zikr, meditation, and mystical poetry. His role now is to “demystify mysticism.” So how perfect that he joins us on the last show of a seven-month exploration of mysticism. He will lead us in two guided meditations into the bliss.

Although there are dozens of superb books on becoming friends with death, the date calls for a Celtic celebration of the circle of life. And who embodies Celtic spirituality like no other? John O’Donohue, of course. But this great soul is not available to lead our discussion. He embraced the angel of death in 2008. So he is sending his dear friend and workshop cofacilitator, Gareth Higgins. In Gareth’s hands, we will not only become friends with death, we will explore the best movies on the subject, and a few of John’s favorite things. Halloween will never be the same!

If death is the great bliss, surely we want to befriend her. When Swami Dhumavati was managing an AIDS hospice in Los Angeles, Ma Jaya Sati Bhagavati came to visit and invited Dhumavati to join her at Kashi Ashram, where AIDS sufferers were gathering to end their days. Swami Dhumavati has been a hands-on witness to hundreds of deaths. She joins us to speak of the path to that great bliss—Mahasamadhi.

                Episode Description:
               </div> Allaudin Mathieu is a brilliant composer, arranger, pianist, choir director, music teacher, and author. He joins us live from his studio in San Francisco, seated at his Steinway piano. At just 22, Allaudin wrote all the music in a famous Stan Kenton album. He went on to become a founder and musical director for Second City in Chicago, and the music director for The Committee, an improv theater is San Francisco. He’s been on the faculty of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and was the original director of the world-famous Sufi Choir. But of greater importance than all his accolades and accomplishments is his deep, abiding love for the gift of music, the joy of song. Join us for a sparkling conversation on 
               <em>Bridge of Waves</em>, his book on how listening to music changes the world.

                Episode Description:
               </div> Chant is more than song. Chant is a spiritual path. Chant is alive, it responds to your intention, and it helps you embody a sacred text, moving it off the page and into your heart. On the wave of intention, your heart turns in a particular direction, and as you chant, your voice opens the door to the silence, where the music and words can unfold in the infinite. An hour with Shefa Gold, author of 
               <em>The Magic of Hebrew Chant,</em> is an hour of magic, wisdom, intention, and love.

Jill is living proof that the call to sing a sacred song doesn’t have to involve words. Jill will share ancient vocal purification practices that cleanse and tune the radiant body and demonstrate how the voice has access to subtle dimensions of reality through Mongolian and Tibetan overtone chanting. All your perceptions of “sacred song” will be shattered listening to Jill’s ecstatic singing.

               </div> Karen Clark first visited our program when Matthew Fox spoke to us of Hildegard of Bingen. Karen sang "O Virtus Sapientiae" by Hildegard. Listening to the exquisite music, something stirred in me and got up and erased all my plans for September and wrote “the call to sing a sacred song.” So it’s perfect that Karen Clark returns today to not only sing more Hildegard, but sacred songs from all times and places, proving that this soul call is truly universal. You’ll hear sacred songs from ancient China to 21st-century America. You’ll even get to sing along to "Ubi Caritas"!

               </div> What is the perfect book to capture our August exploration of “the call to love”? It had to be something by Thich Nhat Hanh, but I couldn’t choose between 
               <em>Fidelity</em> on how to have an intimate relationship and 
               <em>Cultivating the Mind of Love</em> on how to have a loving relationship with all. So I chose both! As with all of Thich Nhat Hanh’s books, these two are short and easy to read. Easy, but not simple. Reading them is like sitting down to have a gentle, loving conversation with Thich Nhat Hanh himself. Rachel Neumann of Parallax Press, Thich Nhat Hanh’s editor in America, joins us to share what it’s like to live deep within the master’s teachings on love.&nbsp;&nbsp;

She had spent years creating the sacred container of Unity of Tustin in Southern California, complete with extensive meditation gardens. But then, as she puts it, “My white board got erased.” In the midst of one change after another, Spirit showed up saying, “All your thoughts of God are too small. You have now been Called by Love.” So what did Marj do? She answered the call! Join her as she tells us what happens when you have been “called by love.” (Because, guess what, you’ve been called by love too!)

In Fr. Rohr’s hands complex spiritual concepts dissolve into language that is so simple, so understandable, that you come away bobbing your head saying, “Oh! I get it! Of course!” This important book delivers the all-important message that every mystic knows: “When you can be present, you will know the Real Presence.” Richard will show us how.

               </div> When you read the mystics, after a while, you begin to notice a few patterns. They see the world differently than we do. They perceive the mystery differently. They touch an essence, a limitless truth, a divine love that sings a song the rest of us may not yet hear. And one other thing: They have a delicious sense of humor. So it’s only perfect that a divinely-appointed “Holy Rascal” rabbi joins us today to add a little spice and humor and paradox to our exploration of what it means to become a mystic.

Because Jim shifts our understanding of the Kingdom of Heaven from a place you go to a place you 
               <em>come from</em>—the totally transformed nondual consciousness of Jesus. If you’ve ever wondered what Jesus really taught, and how he saw the world, this is the conversation for you. It will upend your understanding and open your mind to finally “putting on the mind of Christ.”

Hildegard, too, was a bold, bright radical thinker and the Inquisition was none too happy with her either! She truly is a saint for OUR times.

Listen as she shares the universal message of the mystics, how death cracked her open, why St. John of the Cross is her soul’s partner, and why dropping into the place where we know nothing is essential to the fully lived life.

For more than 30 years, Dr. Neil Douglas-Klotz has immersed himself in the original Aramaic words of Jesus. His translation of The Lord’s Prayer from the Aramaic was first published in 1990 and has sold more than 100,000 copies in five languages. In his preface, Matthew Fox rightly understood that this slender volume contained “the seeds of a revolution.” We are blessed beyond blessed to have Dr. Klotz join us from his home in Scotland.

               </div> Cynthia Bourgeault is an Episcopalian priest and scholar. Her study of 
               <em>The Meaning of Mary Magdalene </em>is a tectonic shift in our understanding of Jesus, his mission, and his followers. Today, Cynthia joins us to share her love of the contemplative prayer method made famous by Fr. Thomas Keating, Centering Prayer. In

If you long to experience a deep prayer of the heart, you will relish this hour with Cynthia Bourgeault.

               </div> Our exploration of “the call to pray” deepens today in conversation with Rev Abhi Janamanchi. After 14 years serving the Unitarian Universalist church in Clearwater, Florida, Rev. Janamanchi has just been selected senior minister for Cedar Lane Unitarian Universalist church in Bethesda, Maryland. Abhi grew up in a liberal Hindu home in India, got a degree in physics from Andrha University, and began a career in banking. But then everything changed when he felt the call to ministry and came to the University of Chicago’s Meadville Lombard Theological School to earn a master's degree. In Chicago, he also created a Bharat Samaj society, a spiritual and social bridge between people of Indian and non-Indian origins.

                Episode Description:
               </div> Kim Narenkivicius answered “the call to leave home” in a big way. The call began in a dream. An old woman in a small village in France held out a scallop shell. Then Kim stumbled upon real scallop shells in an antique store. She got the message! The Camino de Santiago is the most famous pilgrimage route in history. From the time St James’s remains were carried by boat from Jerusalem to Northern Spain and buried in the city of Santiago de Compostela, millions have put a scallop shell around their neck and walked this arduous trail. Most modern pilgrims walk only a small portion. Kim walked the entire route slowly and soulfully, stopping to take photographs and write. She blogs about the experience at 
               <a href="http://soulfulroad.wordpress.com/">http://soulfulroad.wordpress.com</a>. This is the first time Kim has told her story on air. Do not miss it!

                Episode Description:
               </div> I have a special and deeply personal gift for you: Gayle Lawrence, founder of Journeys of Discovery 
               <a href="http://www.ajourneyofdiscovery.com/">http://www.ajourneyofdiscovery.com</a>. Three years ago Gayle told me something magical always happens when you step away from your known, scheduled life and travel into the unknown. I didn’t understand what she was talking about until I took my first group of soul writers on a Gayle-designed Soul-Journ to Oaxaca, Mexico. The experience was so profound, I now lead a Soul-Journ every year. Listen as Gayle tells us what it’s like to swim with a humpback mother whale and her calf, track gorillas in Uganda, and enter sacred sites tourists never get to see. It all started when the rocks in Machu Picchu spoke to her. Come listen to what happens when you step into an outer adventure that becomes an inner journey for your soul.

Listen as John Welshons tells the story of how India changed him forever, how Ram Dass gave him the name “Ramananda” in a dream, and how he became a meditation practitioner and teacher. His book, 
               <em>One Soul, One Love, One Heart</em> is a treasure trove of wisdom on the transcendental truth that we are all one. An added bonus: John shares the four characteristics of a mystical experience. What a way to begin our month!

               </div> This month we are exploring the call to create. We've spoken with a writer/artist and a photographer/creativity guide. Today we bypass particular creative expressions and go deep into the heart of the creative impulse itself. Where does creativity come from? Why, the soul, of course. It comes from 
               <em>Your Creative Soul,</em> and the woman who wrote the book, C Diane Ealy, will be with us to talk about the inherent nature of the soul to create. You'll learn why laughter is divine, how to become a vessel for your creative soul, why "misfitness" is a very good thing, and why creativity isn't for wimps!

All the success in the world couldn't silence that call. Catherine left South Africa and the legal profession, and she&nbsp;slowly forged a life of creativity and joy in Charlotte, North Carolina. You'll love her story. Plus, in honor of Valentine's Day, Janet will play Daniel Nahmod's top love song and give away a few "love" gifts on the show.

               <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1565892127/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwunitfm-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1565892127">Autobiography of a Yogi </a></em>by Paramhansa Yogananda, has changed hundreds of thousands of people’s lives. The perfect person to help us understand the full impact of this seminal book is Philip Goldberg, author of 
               <em>American Veda</em>, a top-10 spiritual book for 2011. This book belongs in your soul’s library and this discussion belongs in your heart.

               </div> There are many ways to answer the call of the soul to go inside. One of them is to create a spiritual practice of stopping once a day, taking a breath, and creating a space in your heart open and ready to receive the wisdom of a few holy words. A million people around the world open 
               <em>Daily Word</em>® every morning for that little moment of turning inside. Laura Harvey is the editor of the 
               <em>Daily Word</em>. Join Janet and Lauren as they talk about the spiritual practices of reading and writing and how you, too, can use words to hear the true voice of your soul.

               </div> We continue our exploration of “the call to go inside” with Lauren Artress, a true spiritual pioneer. At the Canon of Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, she first stumbled upon the mystery of the labyrinth to help us literally step inside and connect with the divine at the center of the labyrinth and the center of our lives. Lauren is the leading force expanding the presence and popularity of the labyrinth in the United States. Her first book,
