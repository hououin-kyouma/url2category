       <li>Do you have a STRONG feeling you’re here on this earth to contribute something valuable, only you have no clue what it is?</li> 
       <li>Do you have a heart for service, the passion of a visionary, and a desire to do something meaningful?</li> 
       <li>Are you tired of your soul-sucking job and dying to find not just another job, but your true calling?</li> 
       <li>Are you just plain bored to tears… feeling lost… out at sea? Not miserable, but not vibrant and in love with life either.</li> 
       <li>Have you been dabbling in various career options, only to wind up more confused than ever?</li>

     <h3 align="center"><strong>INTRODUCING…</strong></h3> 
     <h1 align="center"><span style="color: #cc0001;"><strong>FIND YOUR CALLING</strong></span></h1> 
     <h2 align="center"><span style="color: #cc0001;"><strong>&nbsp;<em>Awaken Your Life Purpose, Clarify Your Vision, &amp; Do Your Soul’s Work&nbsp;</em></strong></span></h2> 
     <h1 align="center"><span style="color: #444444;"><strong>It’s Time for YOU to Step Into Your Life Purpose. You Are Worth It.</strong></span></h1> 
     <p>It is NORMAL to have it take years to find your calling. You may get inklings of what you’re here on this earth to do when you’re young, but chances are good that if you were lucky enough to find your calling in your youth, some well-meaning relative, schoolteacher, or guidance counselor tried to knock some sense into you and steer you towards more practical pursuits (oh those nay sayers!)</p> 
     <p>You may have been strong enough to resist pressures that tried to put you into a box that didn’t fit. You may have even thought, at one point in your life, that you had found your true calling – by practicing medicine or law, teaching elementary school, or saving lives as a cop, firefighter, or paramedic.</p> 
     <p>But then you realized that the systems in your profession are so broken, and the pressures to conform are so great, that the sacrifices required of you sucked the life force right out of you. And you wound up cross-eyed, depleted, and second guessing what you’re really here on this earth to do.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
     <h1 align="center"><strong>Not sure whether you’ve found your calling or not?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1> 
     <p><a href="https://te108.infusionsoft.com/app/orderForms/Find-Your-Calling"><img class="aligncenter" title="red_signupnow.jpg" alt="" src="http://findyourcallingnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/red_signupnow.jpg-300x97.png" width="300" height="97"></a></p> 
     <h3><strong>14 Signs You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Have NOT</span> Found Your Calling</strong></h3> 
     <ol> 
      <li>You aren’t sure you remember how to play, and you’re damn sure play is no way to make a living.</li> 
      <li>You dream about being of service, making a difference, and doing something you love, but you have no clue what that could be.</li> 
      <li>You feel a chronic sense of wistful longing, as if something is missing but you can’t quite put your finger on it.</li> 
      <li>You feel anxious or blue, even though you’re not quite sure why.</li> 
      <li>You avoid quiet time for reflection ’cause too much stuff bubbles up… maybe you even put the TV or radio on the minute silence shows up.</li> 
      <li>You groan when the alarm clock goes off in the morning, even after 8 hours of sleep.</li> 
      <li>Everything feels hard, and nothing seems to flow.</li> 
      <li>When people ask you what you love, you shrug your shoulders.</li> 
      <li>You find yourself asking questions like, “Is this all there is?”</li> 
      <li>Even if you know what you love, you make excuses for why you could never do what you love professionally.</li> 
      <li>You seek happiness in superficial things, such as material possessions, flatter abs, or a cleaner closet.</li> 
      <li>You dread talking about your work.</li> 
      <li>You’re not putting your heart into your work and keep getting passed over for promotions.</li> 
      <li>You count the days until Friday and the months until your next vacation.</li> 
     </ol> 
     <p>Does this sound like you? Don’t despair, darlings! We’ve been there, done that, and felt that same “Ugh.” We know all too well about how it feels to be OFF purpose. But more on that in a minute.</p> 
     <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://findyourcallingnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/les-brown.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-133 aligncenter" title="les brown" alt="" src="http://findyourcallingnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/les-brown-300x257.jpg" width="500" height="400"></a></p> 
     <h1 align="center"><span style="color: #0f95f4;"><span style="color: #444444;"><strong> Pssssst… Here’s the fabulous news; your calling <em>never</em> stops searching for you. In fact, it’s been searching for you your whole life.</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h1> 
     <p>As a child, when someone asked you what you wanted to be when you grew up, you probably jumped up and down with both arms raised and squealed, “A ballerina!” or “A train conductor!” or “An artist!” or “President.” Maybe you knew at a young age that you wanted to be a film star, a musician, a doctor or veterinarian, a lawyer defending kids in juvenile hall, or a politician who would save the world.<em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
     <p><em>Then life happened.</em></p> 
     <p>Maybe you followed your dream and things didn’t work out. Maybe you pursued your passion only to discover you weren’t so passionate about it. Or perhaps you, like so many of us, ultimately caved into the pressure to do something out of alignment with your soul’s joy. After all, at some point, it’s time to be a grown up. After all, there are mouths to feed, bills to pay, debt to get out of, and kids to put through college.&nbsp; You can’t just spend your life prancing around flower fields, grasping at pipe dreams that are completely out of reach, right?</p> 
     <h1 align="center"><span style="color: #0f95f4;"><span style="color: #444444;"><strong>So you settled on something close enough, even if it wasn’t exactly your heart’s passion.</strong></span>&nbsp;</span></h1> 
     <p>It paid the bills – well enough, at least. Maybe you even wound up with a big, sparkly pair of golden handcuffs which, coupled with big debt and big expenses, leaves you feeling like finding your calling is a luxury other people might be lucky enough to pursue – but not you. You’ve gotta keep your head screwed on straight. Others are counting on you. Someone’s gotta be the practical one.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
     <p><strong>But even so, a little voice inside you keeps whispering, <em>“There’s more for you out there.”</em></strong></p> 
     <p>You try to talk yourself out of it. You should just be grateful for what you already have, right? After all, there are starving people in Africa. In this economy, if you have a job – even a soul-sucking one – you’re darned lucky, right? You should just suck it up, count your blessings and silence the crazy ideas that keep noodling around in the back recesses of your mind during dark, lonely nights when the voice of your soul just won’t shut up.</p> 
     <p>Or should you?</p> 
     <p>What if you – like Lissa’s father, woke up one day and found out you only had three months left to live? Would you be living life the way you are now? Don’t you yearn to leave this life with your gifts fully realized, your passion fully expressed, your mark left on the world? Wouldn’t you love to live each day as if it could be your last – with zero regrets?</p> 
     <h1 align="center"><span style="color: #444444;"><strong>Don’t leave this planet with your song unsung.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h1> 
     <h1 align="center"><span style="color: #444444;"><strong>Imagine waking up in the morning knowing that you are living your purpose.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h1> 
     <h1 align="center"><span style="color: #444444;"><strong>Won’t that feel DIVINE?</strong>&nbsp;</span></h1> 
     <p>This is all possible for you. We know, not only because we’ve seen crazy ideas transform into beautiful realities with thousands of clients. But we also know because we’ve lived it ourselves.</p>

      <div> 
       <p>The poet Stanley Kunitz once wrote, “How shall my heart be reconciled to its feast of losses?”&nbsp;If it doesn’t make your gaze go soft for a moment as you reflect upon the feast of losses you’ve faced – either presently or in the past – you’re either very young, bizarrely lucky, or abusing horse tranquilizers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably all three.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as a human heart without its feast of losses.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more true than ever today, as the world changes so rapidly, and so much is falling apart.</p> 
       <div> 
        <p>I’m not young, my luck is variable, and I can’t get anyone to give me horse tranquilizers.&nbsp;Which is to say that my heart has feasted often on loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt lost as a child growing up in a family full of unspoken pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt lost as I tried to ease the ache at my center with hyper-achievement, going off to Harvard at 17 and staying for three degrees.</p> 
        <p><strong>And then I&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;got lost.</strong></p> 
       </div> 
       <p>If you’ve read my two memoirs,&nbsp;<em>Expecting Adam&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Leaving the Saints,&nbsp;</em>you may know how I lost my identity as an intellectual when my second child, Adam, was prenatally diagnosed with Down syndrome, and I (against the advice of the entire Harvard community) decided to keep him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only had I lost the “normal” child I expected, but my life’s foundational belief that being smart and working hard was what gave me value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here was a child, flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone, who’d never go to Harvard.&nbsp;&nbsp;What gave him value?&nbsp;&nbsp;Not anything I’d valued up to then.</p> 
       <div> 
        <p>For a while I also thought I’d lost my mind, because my son came with a lot of experiences that made no sense inside the rational, material, scientific worldview where I’d carved a safe little niche for my brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam is a strange critter, surrounded by magic, like the wardrobe in the Narnia books that sometimes is just a wardrobe, sometimes a passageway to another world.&nbsp;Exploring that world, which I guess we’d call spiritual, meant losing my usual sense of reality.</p> 
        <p>I ran from Harvard back to Utah, where I grew up, and where I knew my choice to keep Adam would be regarded not as idiocy but as heroism.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hah.&nbsp;&nbsp;As if.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where better to become a spiritual seeker than in my childhood religion, surrounded by deeply religious people?</p> 
        <p><strong>Um, as it turned out, almost anywhere.</strong></p> 
        <p>My search for the deepest truth of my own life led me to actively question and ultimately leave my childhood religion – and leaving Mormonism is the worst thing a Mormon can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;My feast of losses soon included my family of origin, my childhood friends, my job (I’d been working at Brigham Young University while finishing my Harvard doctorate) and my home.</p> 
       </div> 
       <p>What I’ve learned from all this, and the thousand other small losses that have constituted my life since (just like yours) is that to live happily we must die easily, and to be given everything, we must give everything up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that sound depressing?&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn’t.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just the caterpillar surrendering to the butterfly its true self always intended to become.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your losses, too, are meant to give your life more freedom, color, and beauty than you can presently imagine.&nbsp;&nbsp;With this course, Lissa, Amy and I hope to make your metamorphosis easier and shorter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Which will not be saying much, but still.</p> 
       <p>Unlike caterpillars, humans can go through many metamorphoses in one lifetime.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have found that simply trying to reconcile our hearts to their feasts of losses paradoxically – almost as a byproduct – can yield love, happiness, success, abundance.&nbsp;&nbsp;“The time will come,” as Derek&nbsp;Walcott&nbsp;wrote in&nbsp;<em>Love After Love</em>, “when, with elation/ you will greet yourself arriving/ at your own door…/and each will smile at the other’s welcome,/ and say, sit here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eat./…Feast on your life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, life is complex and full of letting go.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is meant to teach you how to fly.&nbsp;And to mix metaphors.</p> 
       <p>Seriously, please join us!</p>

      <p>My story bears many resemblances to Martha’s, minus the Down’s baby and the death-threatening Mormons. I also thought I found my calling young. I raised and released dozens of injured and abandoned squirrels until I was old enough to attend medical school and hone my healing arts on people.</p> 
      <p><strong>My medical education was extremely traumatizing for me</strong>.&nbsp;But I endured the trauma because the calling to serve my fellow human beings in their times of suffering was strong. Although my body and two marriages broke down as a result of the strain of medical school and residency, I soldiered on, because – hell, that’s what good doctors do, right?</p> 
      <p>By the time I was 33, I was twice divorced and taking seven medications every day, but that didn’t stop me from seeing 40 patients/day and selling out my integrity in a health care system that bore little resemblance to the healing arts I dreamed of practicing when I was a young child. I yearned to love and serve in times of pain and suffering, so I could comfort and inspire people to muster the courage they would need in order to heal themselves. Only I couldn’t find a way to fit my calling into a rigid, broken healthcare system that left little room for the kind of healing work my soul longed to do.</p> 
      <p>At this point in my career, I had all the trappings of “success” – the house in San Diego with the white water view, the vacation home, the trips to Hawaii, and the big fat retirement account so I could quit my job and be happy… one day.&nbsp; I might have stayed like that – comfortably numb, spiritually bankrupt, and financially secure – had it not been for what I came to call my “Perfect Storm.”</p> 
      <p>In January of 2006, I gave birth to my daughter by C-section, my healthy 33 year old brother wound up in full blown liver failure as a rare side effect of a common antibiotic, my 16 year old dog died, and my beloved father died of a brain tumor – all within two weeks. To say that all hell broke loose in my life would be a massive understatement.</p> 
      <p>My Perfect Storm was my own version of Martha’s big crack up, and it shook me out of my complacency and plunged me into the tempest of uncertainty, in which everything I held as dear and true fell apart. Old beliefs began to dissolve but nothing rushed in to take their place. I felt like I was floating, weightless, ungrounded – desperately, seemingly hopelessly lost.</p> 
      <p>I wound up leaving my secure job as a full time partner in a busy OB/GYN practice, which required paying a $120,000 “malpractice tail” in order to buy my freedom. My husband, who planned to be an unemployed stay-home dad, brought in no income to help ease the financial burden that fell on my shoulders. I had a new family to provide for, two mortgages to pay, and suddenly, no job and no clue what I was supposed to do if the job I had thought was my calling was no longer aligned with my soul.</p> 
      <p><strong>Then the dreaming and scheming and re-forming began.</strong>&nbsp;I started getting glimpses of a new calling, but it would only come in flashes, in undefined, fuzzy form. I knew I wanted to continue my healing work – but in some altogether new fashion. I missed my patients – not the long hours or the rushed office visits, but the privilege of being invited into the deep recesses of their lives. Pondering how I could keep the parts of being a doctor that I loved while ditching what sucked out my soul led me to realize that I wanted to help people learn to be brave enough to live unapologetically, in alignment with the truth of who they really are. After healing myself from a variety of health conditions after quitting my job, I had a sneaking suspicion that if I could help people do this, their bodies would heal as a side effect.</p> 
      <p>Like Martha, I never could have anticipated what happened next in my professional life. Blogging, book deals, public speaking, a mentoring program, and an online entrepreneurial business creating programs like this one – who’da thunk?&nbsp; I couldn’t have written a business plan for the calling that continues to emerge, like an onion, as I peel back the layers and become increasingly clear on what I’m here on this earth to do.</p> 
      <p>While the process hasn’t been easy, it has been the most rewarding, magical, enlightening, connecting journey I’ve ever experienced. In retrospect, I can honestly say that my Perfect Storm, as gut-wrenching as it was – was the best thing that ever happened to me. And if you’re in the midst of a Perfect Storm all your own, this course can help you alchemize trauma and loss into an opportunity to discover your purpose.</p>

      <p>I knew from an early age that I was in tune with how others felt. I remember being on the playground sticking up for the misfits, having heart to hearts with friends in crisis in the hallways of Jr. high and spending endless hours on the phone talking about the meaning of life… at 14.</p> 
      <p>When I discovered the field of Life Coaching and went to my first training weekend back in 2000 <strong>I had a light bulb “I found my calling” moment</strong>. It was as if I finally had a name for what I’d been doing my entire life for friends, colleagues, even strangers in the checkout line. So I took a leap of faith and began working to create livelihood from coaching.</p> 
      <p>I formed an amazing business partnership with a fellow coach and dear friend and over the course of seven years we ended up working inside corporations helping them achieve goals and keep their people happy. But I started to grow weary of being in florescent lit conference rooms with people who didn’t want to be there. And I wanted to start a family and work with people that really craved coaching.</p> 
      <p><strong>And then the major wake-up call moment happened… my big meltdown</strong>. My beloved husband, Rob, had been adopted at birth, but was later sought out by his birth mom in his twenties. From the moment they were reunited, a deep and profound soul connection emerged. I remember being so nervous to meet her, knowing that I needed her stamp of approval big time if I was going to be with Rob. When I did meet her, it felt like I was also reunited with a soulmate and long time best friend. Rob’s birth mom was our go-to coach, spiritual mentor and wise woman.</p> 
      <p>Unfortunately she also suffered from chronic pain and after a number of botched spinal surgeries, she felt trapped in her own body. Depression ensued and we did everything we could to support her.</p> 
      <p>And then, on August 29, 2005, the exact same day that Hurricane Katrina destroyed so many lives, Rob’s birth mom committed suicide. She jumped off a bridge in Seattle, finally ending her years of pain and suffering, leaving a hurricane of grief for us to swirl in. And then just six months later, Rob’s adoptive mom was diagnosed with cancer. She passed away peacefully at home with us by her side three weeks after the diagnosis.</p> 
      <p>Rob and I were left in shell shock. And I felt a stirring in my soul that I must make a change. That life was too short to not do what I love. And two of the biggest callings in my life surfaced loud and clear: “It’s time to be a mom.” and ““You must tell the TRUTH about how hard we are on ourselves and what it costs us.” Within two months I was pregnant and we moved from Los Angeles up to my hometown in the San Francisco Bay Area, my business partnership ended, and I took a stand to only work with people who wanted coaching.&nbsp; I began dreaming and scheming of touching tens of thousands of lives, of operating a wildly successful business from home and so much more. So I launched my company, Wake-Up Call Coaching, got a book deal, and am now here partnering with two amazing women for a course about one of the things nearest and dearest to my heart: helping others find their calling.</p>

     <h1 align="center"><span style="color: #7977ff;"><span style="color: #444444;"><strong>There is a Method to the Madness</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h1> 
     <p>Martha teaches about how we endure change with a four phase model she calls “the change cycle” and just understanding where you are at in the cycle can allow you to BREATHE and FIND PEACE. We will teach this extensively in the class, but check this out to see if you can relate:</p> 
     <p><a href="http://findyourcallingnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/change.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-134 aligncenter" title="change" alt="" src="http://findyourcallingnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/change.png" width="432" height="292" srcset="http://findyourcallingnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/change.png 432w, http://findyourcallingnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/change-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px"></a></p> 
     <h1 align="center"><span style="color: #0f95f4;"><span style="color: #444444;"><strong>Where Are You In The Change Cycle?</strong></span>&nbsp;</span></h1> 
     <p>If you feel like you’re trying to find your calling, chances are good that you’re in Meltdown or Reformation, though questioning your life purpose may come up in any phase. Maybe you haven’t even entered the change cycle yet. Maybe you haven’t had a big meltdown (and frankly, you really don’t want one!), but you’re dreaming about taking a leap of faith – maybe quitting a job you don’t love, even though you have no clue what would light you up. Or maybe you already had your meltdown (or created one by taking a crazy leap), and now you find yourself in the Emerging phase, pursuing a passion you thought was your calling, only it’s really not working out. Maybe you even made it to Full Flight, like Martha did at Harvard or Lissa did in her medical job or Amy did with her first coaching business. Only the promised land turned out to be not all it promised to be. Wherever you are, we suspect that you’re ready to take steps to the next level of your highest calling.</p> 
     <h1 align="center"><span style="color: #444444;"><strong>Wherever you are in the change cycle, this program aims to not only help you make peace with the process, but to give you practical tools to help you move to the next phase and get closer to not only finding your calling, but bringing your vision to life.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h1> 
     <h1 align="center"><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="color: #cc0001;"><strong>&nbsp;It’s time to emerge as that beautiful butterfly, baby!</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h1> 
     <p>All three of us wish we’d had access to a program like this one back when we were in the midst of our meltdowns, when we were feeling lost, crazy, and directionless in the aftermath, when we thought we were crazy for having big dreams and schemes, when things weren’t going so well, and when we realized we had to leave those stable jobs and business partnerships, only to start all over again. Had we known then what we know now, we would have felt much less anxiety as we navigated the journey. We might even have hastened the process, saving ourselves many sleepless nights, and wasting a lot less money!</p> 
     <h1 align="center"><span style="color: #444444;"><strong>Our desire to be of service to help people, just like you, find and fulfill their callings inspired us to put our noodles together to share with you not only what we’ve learned along the way personally, but also what we’ve learned from helping thousands of clients.</strong>&nbsp;</span></h1> 
     <p>Martha has shared some of her experience and wisdom in her bestselling books like <strong><em>Finding Your Own North Star </em></strong>and <strong><em>Finding Your Way In A Wild New World.</em></strong> But never has she collaborated with two other coaches to crystallize her teaching into a practical step-by-step program that provides you not only with tools for making peace with wherever you are in the process, but also tools meant to leapfrog you forward into clarity of your purpose in community with other like-minded visionaries, in search of their purpose.</p>

      <p>After Modules 1 and 2, you will be on the path, remembering who you are and what makes you come alive. You’ll be anxious and ready to get out of that cocoon and fly, but callings take the time they take. When you’re about to emerge and break free from your cocoon into a whole new life, fear has a tendency to show up with a vengeance. Self-sabotaging inner voices spout Big Fat Lies like “But I can’t do that!” or “How will I ever pay the bills?” or “What will everybody think?” If you’re not prepared to face up to these fears, the critical inner voices can be loud enough to make a visionary on a mission run back to a safe, secure cubicle in a soul-sucking job.</p> 
      <p><strong>In module 3 you will:</strong></p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Get filled to the brim with courage-inducing techniques to help you combat the Inner Critic voices.</li> 
       <li>Discover tools for overcoming fear, avoiding the limiting beliefs and self-sabotaging behaviors that can make you get in your own way.</li> 
       <li>Cultivate faith, community and support for your vision.</li>

      <p>By Module 4, you’ll have a clear sense of what you’re here on this planet to do, you may even be ready to spread your wings. You’ll claim your&nbsp;<em>North Star</em>&nbsp;that will guide you, even on the foggiest of nights. And now it is time to move into action. Even the smallest baby step or “turtle step” will feel miraculous because you are saying to The Universe “YES! I believe in me and my calling!” &nbsp;Here’s the hard truth, once you’re clear on your calling, you’re not off the hook yet! &nbsp;Finding your calling isn’t enough. To bring a vision to life, you have to take definitive action.</p> 
      <p><strong>In module 4 you will:</strong></p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Anchor in your passions and purpose and declare your North Star.</li> 
       <li>Use the Three N’s (notice, narrow and name) so you can begin to fly.</li> 
       <li>Learn how to take the first step towards stepping into your calling and making the world a better place with the work it’s your destiny to contribute.</li> 
       <li>Discover &nbsp;what “cognitive style” operates you – how you personally take action – and how to use your individual cognitive style to its greatest advantage.</li> 
       <li>Demystify when it’s time to take a leap of faith – and when it’s time to wait.</li> 
       <li>Claim clarity, direction, purpose, and a plan. And the world will be a better place because you do!</li>

      <div> 
       <p>Discouraged by our broken health care system and curious why some patients do everything “right” but still wind up sick, Lissa set out to discover why some patients experience miraculous cures from seemingly incurable illnesses, while others remain sick even when they receive the best medical care. She researched what really makes people healthy and what predisposes them to illness – not just diet, exercise and standard healthy behaviors, but everything else. What she uncovered in the mainstream medical literature led her to develop a type of medical practice she terms “Whole Health Medicine,” based on the scientifically-proven healthy behaviors she shares in Mind Over Medicine. She is now leading a health care revolution to empower patients to heal themselves, while encouraging the health care industry to embrace and facilitate, rather than resist, such medical “miracles.”</p> 
      </div> 
      <p>Lissa blogs at&nbsp;LissaRankin.com&nbsp;and also created two online communities –&nbsp;HealHealthCareNow.com&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ow<wbr>ningPink.com.&nbsp;She is also the author of two other books. Lissa’s work will be the focus of an upcoming public television special that will appear on PBS, she has delivered two popular TEDx talks, and she is on the speaking circuit with Hay House’s “I Can Do It” conferences. Lissa’s work&nbsp;has also been featured on over 30 television shows, over 50 radio shows, and in publications such as O Magazine, the New York Times, Health, Women’s Health, Forbes, Glamour, Cosmopolitan, Fox News, Huffington Post, People, Woman’s Day, WebMD, and CNN.</p> 
      <p>Lissa&nbsp;is also&nbsp;a professional artist, an amateur ski bum, and an avid hiker, and she&nbsp;lives in the San Francisco Bay area with her husband and daughter.</p>
