         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing.</strong> &nbsp;—Annie Dillard</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The point here is that we all go through phases and cycles that determine our path, trajectory, and destination. Amidst the chaotic stretches where you feel like we have no control there are other moments of clarity, joy and &nbsp;opportunity. Windows of time that give us the chance to make a change, shift gears, pivot—hopefully focus more on what we really want.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Age 26, according to the unscientific longitudinal Kobara study involving thousands of unsuspecting subjects, starts an 8 year time frame (until 34) where the brain starts to shift to serious things.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It all started some time ago…….</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">High school is a blur that is dominated by embryonic ideas of self and a confusing cocktail of peer pressure, parental expectations, promises and perfection. Angst over picking a college. The future is filled with questions and excitement.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Who am I?</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">College can be an awakening unless it was just an extension of high school Average college students change their major 2.5 times. Angst over a major that will connect to a career that cannot be predicted. New questions emerge.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>What do I want?</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Passion and purpose can be submerged to the realities of student loans and dental benefits.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Caring what others think can distract us from discovering ourselves, our purpose and our joy.&nbsp; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d2933241970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Finding-joy-in-the-journey" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b8d2933241970c img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d2933241970c-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Finding-joy-in-the-journey"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Psychologists and social scientists have found that there are two kinds of popularity: One type suggests people like us, they trust us, they want to spend time with us, they enjoy their time with us. That kind of popularity is really important — it gives us a benefit in life in so many domains, for decades, whether we experience it in childhood or as adults. The second type of popularity is the one we remember from high school, that refers to our status; it reflects our visibility, our influence, our power — our celebrity, in some ways. There’s research showing that type of popularity — status popularity — does not predict long term positive outcomes. In fact, it leads to despair, addiction, and relationship problems. But most people are still confusing the two types of popularity, and searching for the wrong one." &nbsp;Mitch Prinstein,&nbsp;<em>Popular: The Power of Likability In A Status-Obsessed World.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">And we can get focused on, even worship things, things we believe will make us happy and or successful.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">“....<em>pretty much anything you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things — if they are where you tap real meaning in life — then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you. The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily consciousness. Worship power — you will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart — you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.” </em>David Foster Wallace</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Am I where I am supposed to be? Am I having fun?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to the annual <strong><em><a href="http://www.heri.ucla.edu/cirpoverview.php">Freshman Survey (20 years ago+)</a></em></strong>, the three top goals of first year students in&nbsp;college, in order of preference, are <strong>authority in their field </strong>(don't even have a major :), <strong>raise a family </strong>and <strong>being very well off financially</strong>. The survey reflects the responses of 1.5 million college students&nbsp;from every state. These results have been relatively consistent for 50 years.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">That's why I found it fascinating that they did a follow-up study 10 years later when these former 200,000+ freshman were now&nbsp;28ish. They were asked the same questions. So what were their top three goals now that they have a degree and a healthy dose of the real world?</span></p> 
          <ol> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Raise a family</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Develop a meaningful philosophy of life</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Become an expert in their field</span></li> 
          </ol> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Help others in difficulty was 4th and being very well off financially fell to 7th.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Develop a philosophy of life?!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Your heart has been giving you signals for a long time but you have muffled those messages by turning up the volume on your life distraction headsets.</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You could have one of several "wake-up calls". The world around you starts to call out your name, you wonder how to become an agent of change. &nbsp;You notice something entering or exiting your heart. A brush with death, yours or someone you love, a subtle or not so subtle connection with life's purpose. You get laid off, not promoted. Then the self-interrogator of life rises again with the blinding light of nerve wracking queries.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Is this all there is? What difference am I going to make? Where is my joy?</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Graduate school? Graduate school again?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Marriage or kids or no kids? The initial formation of what I call "regret tumors" starts. Beginning with the abandonment of dreams or promises. Not malignant but ominous tumors.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Seeing the present for the first time instead of letting the <em>next</em> bulldoze the <em>now</em>.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Most of you under-estimate yourself and doubt is your enemy.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A few of you over estimate yourself and arrogance is your enemy.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Both are necessary for success but you need more perspective, humility, grit and resilience.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Start re-booting your life--- a life that interweaves your passions and your goals. Start listening and trusting your heart. This is not easy, but it is rewarding.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>What is meaningful to you? What gives you joy?</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If you are over the age of 34, it is never too late. Your quest for greater fulfillment and your sense of contributing to something larger than you is growing within you. Time is fleeting.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><u><a href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/networking/2010/02/if-i-dont-i-will-regret-it-avoiding-the-regret-matrix.html">Regrets</a></u></strong> age you. Regrets can kill you. Minimize regrets!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><em>If your goal is to make meaning by trying to solve a big problem in innovative ways, you are more likely to make money than if you start with the goal of making money, in which case you will probably not make money or meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong>Guy Kawasaki</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The key is engaging others in your quest. In your journey. In your dreams. Getting help to pursue your ideas. Getting advice on what others have already learned and tried. Connect! Don't fall victim to the "do-it-yourself" trap. It never works! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Listen to yourself! The you that jumps out of the passenger seat and takes over the steering wheel of your life! Start building a life that gives you joy!</span></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So you are waiting for the <em>right</em> time. The confluence of great opportunity, financial security and a sign from the heavens.....</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is no right time, just right now!</span></p>

         <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader"> <span class="entry-title"> <a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2017/06/the-network-before-networking.html">NetworkSharing</a> </span> </h2> 
         <h5 class="date-header font-dateheader"> <span class="entry-date"><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2017/06/the-network-before-networking.html">June 07, 2017</a></span> </h5> 
         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p>Lot of discussion about how to meet people and the way you say hello. Yes all of the technique driven first impression stuff matters but where are you networking? All of us need practice at just getting out there more and introducing ourselves, talking less and listening more. Having more concise answers and pithy questions at the ready. But what if your ladder is leaning on the wrong wall, you are fishing in unlucky waters, or you are mingling where there are no movers or shakers.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb099cfdf0970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Weak ties" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301bb099cfdf0970d img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb099cfdf0970d-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Weak ties"></a></p> 
          <p>Here's the deal: Get out of your bubblicious world of contacts that are connected to what you already know. You have to get out of the <em><strong>strong tie</strong> </em>interchange of comfortable social and professional networks and branch out to the <strong><em>weak tie</em> </strong>world of new opportunities. &nbsp;Note: See Granovetter research and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2013/08/your-network-of-cousins.html " style="color: #0000ff;">my related post</a></strong></span>.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>Sure you can look at the job postings or respond to different parts of your Facebook feed, but you will be caught in your own gravitational orbit of familiarity.</p> 
          <p><strong>We are all sitting on enormous networks we will never use or ever fully appreciate. Like all abundant resources we need to explore them and share them! It is crazy how much influence and power we are connected to. What if we opened up these contacts to others? Help others connect and then get connected. First rule of networking is always give first--to share.</strong></p> 
          <p>Want a new job, meet new people? Get connected to the people you know and the people they know. On Linkedin it would be your 2nd and 3rd tier connections. Based on interests you get introduced to these connected worlds to learn about work, associations, hobbies, causes... You have a cup of coffee, join an online forum, attend an event through a weak tie connection. For example, you have a family member who is battling a disease, you want to learn about opera, you'd like to more involved with your identity (ethnic, gender, LBGT etc), you want to learn about self-driving cars. Personal stuff, random stuff that you are interested in. Ideally something you have promised yourself that you would pursue someday. Because fulfilling a little promise to yourself feels good! Or helping someone else connect feels great!</p> 
          <p>You start asking around who is connected with the Alzheimers Association, the Asian American Lawyers, Uber/Google/Tesla. You look deeper into your Linkedin account for such connections. You ask someone you know to share their contact or connection and be introduced and whamo you are off to the races. You have just traversed the weak tie superhighway to something new that you are interested in. The shared network handshake!</p> 
          <p>And your real handshake and your eye contact also need to be coordinated. Yes, your resume should be updated too.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>But more important you need your list of interests!! What's on your list? Note: When is the last time you SWiVELed?&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b8d284236b970c img-responsive"><a href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/files/swivel_new_2017.doc" style="background-color: #ffffff;">Download SWIVEL_new_2017</a></span></strong></span></p> 
          <p><strong>So the key to networking is who you are networking with--it's the network, stupid!&nbsp;</strong></p> 
          <p>Perhaps you will really learn about your interest and pursue more ways to get engaged with this interest and meet others who share this interest. But it is equally as likely that you may will be introduced to a new world of opportunities you never knew existed. Every new person will reveal something new, if you allow it. I did not say something amazing that rocks your world I said "new". &nbsp;We need new perspectives on career, happiness, balance, meaning, and fulfillment. We need all the help we can get. This is where the listening and open mind parts are so vital.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>Meeting new people on the common ground of interest is interesting. It is not the bobbing and weaving to gain attention or be clever in the semi-dishonest dance of a cocktail reception. It is the sharing of curiosity and knowledge, and maybe even passion.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>And you know when you are asked to talk about something that you care about--you like it. Not a burden or a favor. It is always nice and even fun to meet people with common interests and share.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p><strong>You can have everything in life you want, if you will just help other people get what they want.</strong> Zig Ziglar</p> 
          <p>This type of networking opens your eyes and if you let it, your heart--to new people and ideas.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>I have a personal goal to do this once a week! Not unusual for me to do it twice a week. To have the joy of meeting new people with shared interests through referrals or to agree to make the connections for others. It has become a lifestyle of sharing connections.&nbsp;It is also how I rode the Goodyear Blimp, traveled to Cuba, played golf at St Andrews, got job offers, and moved into our current house--but those are stories for another time.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>Evaluate your network start &nbsp;linking to the other worlds you don't know and sharing with new people you will get to know!</p> 
          <p>Thanks for reading. John</p>

         <h5 class="date-header font-dateheader"> <span class="entry-date"><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2017/05/random-acts-of-progress-and-the-path-forward.html">May 19, 2017</a></span> </h5> 
         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We unfortunately seem to be unconsciously biased against those in society who come out on top or the bottom. When we&nbsp;assess the world, we tend to see what we expect to see. We can equate degree of success with degree of talent and reinforce our conclusions of causality by noting the correlation. The worst type of confirmation bias. The " I wish more people worked hard, as I have"--myopic self-deception. In reality there is often&nbsp;little difference in ability/talent between the "successful" and the "unsuccessful". The biggest difference is how randomness impacted the outcomes and opportunities.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In Leonard Mlodinow's insightful book:<span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0000ff;"> <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drunkards-Walk-Randomness-Rules-Lives/dp/0307275175" style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #0000ff;">The Drunkard's Walk</a></strong></span>: How Randomness Rules Our Lives, he asserts how things that appear linear, cause and effect, and intentional, all the way down to the molecular level are random.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Whoa, I can feel I pushed your doubt buttons! Fair enough. But let me explain and allow some randomness to influence your thinking oh reader of great certainty ;)</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>The random motion of molecules in a fluid can be viewed as a metaphor for our own paths through life, and so it is worthwhile to take a little time to give Einstein’s work a closer look. According to the atomic picture, the fundamental motion of water molecules is chaotic. The molecules fly first this way, then that, moving in a straight line only until deflected by an encounter with one of their sisters. This type of path—in which at various points the direction changes randomly—is often called a <strong>drunkard’s walk</strong>, for reasons obvious to anyone who has ever enjoyed a few too many martinis (more sober mathematicians and scientists sometimes call it a random walk). If particles that float in a liquid are, as atomic theory predicts, constantly and rand</em>omly <em>bombarded by the molecules of the liquid, one might expect them to jiggle this way and that owing to the collisions.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So many things we do are impacted by things we don't do and that sets us on a course--or a walk if you will. Things are always colliding with our direction and ideas and once in a while we see them or pay attention to them. We can take credit for these momentary and intermittent flashes of awareness. Our brains want to simplify the timeline so that we can take or give credit or issue blame.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d2823a97970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Phone-whale_3188738b" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b8d2823a97970c img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d2823a97970c-640wi" style="width: 620px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Phone-whale_3188738b"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Your place of birth, your parents, your health, your general DNA allocation was random. Even if you think that there was divine intervention or a pre-conceived destiny, there was&nbsp;a huge component of randomness that derived your 23 chromosomes. And all of the "decisions" you made or were made for you.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What if I didn't accept my mentor's advice that led to a new career? Talked to that stranger who I married and have three kids with? Made that turn, or went to that event, or went on that date, or said yes, instead of no, or wore the red tie, or had Mexican instead of Italian...... Do you really know what would have could have happened? What we pay attention to makes a difference.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>For everything you have missed, you have gained something else, and for everything you gain, you lose something else. &nbsp;</strong>Ralph Waldo<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Emerson</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What we do know is not everyone is born into the same randomness, contexts for chance, opportunities for choice.</span> There is great inequity in the sets of randomness we inherit. We all know the story of the immigrant who overcomes obstacles to become a billionaire. Or a blind singer who becomes a record breaking star. And if we are not careful we believe that random opportunity is out there for every immigrant or disabled person.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We know the randomness at Exeter&nbsp;is different than at East LA Community College. The different molecules that are bombarding off of you will create different drunkard's walks.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>I don't think you can be deliberate about shaping your course forward because you then end up somewhere completely stale and expected. &nbsp;</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>I think a lot about this relationship between cynicism and hope. And critical thinking without hope is cynicism. But hope without critical thinking is naïveté.</strong>&nbsp;Maria Popova</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So I try to reside&nbsp;between the two to try to build a bridge, because blaming others and feeling hopeless about changing our course generates a feeling of futility. Then cynicism rises up to provide a false sense of protection while our dreams evaporate. We can restore our hope and energy by moving forward even if we are stumbling and failing along the way.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>But on the other hand, believing blindly that everything will work out just fine also produces a kind of resignation because we have no motive to apply ourselves toward making things better. And I think in order to survive, both as individuals and as a civilization, but especially in order to thrive, we need to bridge critical thinking with hope.</strong>"</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What appears random or "lucky" was usually right in front of you. You know when you think of something and then it appears everywhere--not talking about Google's algorithms :) Or the so-called Law of Attraction. But it is true when you think and discuss your needs your bucket list, your dream job, yes things "appear"</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.</strong> Paolo Coelho</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So two huge lessons I have learned. Help those with fewer choices and chances see the periphery, see the molecules around them, help them to allow life to happen and divert them from their unsatisfying pursuit of happiness.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">Listen to your heart. Open your eyes. Let the paths that are there surround you and reveal themselves.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">And for those with fewer chances and choices, those who are more bombarded by the molecules lower on Maslow's, help them have a better chance to see the molecules that are foreign and strange. Guide them to a space where they can see themselves. Where there is sufficiency of opportunity. Not a crutch but a helping hand to give them perspective.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Why? Because we need all of the talent we have to blossom. We desperately need more people to find what they want and to be less oppressed by what others expect.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Randomness enables us to express things we did not know we had or wanted. Randomness awakens the genius in each of us. Randomness is the way of nature.</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Not ignoring reality and responsibility, but being more aware of what interests us, taking chances, and eliminating regrets before they happen.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The future is already here it just isn't evenly distributed.</strong> William Gibson</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Life just appears before you. Choices, chances. Too often we try to take credit for what is and we forget how we got there. All of the advice, education, mistakes, mentoring, role models, and yes luck, should&nbsp;take a rear seat to our false and unfounded control over our destinies.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yes being focused helps immensely. Yes being planful is also very useful. But what are you missing while you plan? Is your plan and laser-like attention creating a myopia that ignores amazing opportunities or revelations.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.</strong> Emerson</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Random acts of kindness and progress. Allowing the molecules&nbsp;of randomness push us on our own drunkard's walk and discover new people and places.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Judy Rupp's excerpt from Old maps don't work</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is time for the pilgrim in me</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> to travel in the dark,</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> to learn to read the stars</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> that shine in my soul.</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> I will walk deeper</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> into the dark of my night.</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> I will wait for the stars.</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> trust their guidance.</span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and let their light be enough for me.</span></p>

         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p>Another story about networking and allowing life to happen. Late last year, I spoke to a non-profit group and afterwards a nice Asian American guy named Richard Cheung, told me he liked my speech. He asked if I could speak in Pasadena next year. I said what I always say, "Let's see if I am a fit and if we can work out the schedule." The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://ww5.cityofpasadena.net/mayor/" style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">Mayor of Pasadena Terry Tornek</a></span></strong></span> asked me to keynote the 44th annual Mayor's Prayer Breakfast on May 4, 2017--on the national day of prayer. They wanted an ecumenical speaker on the the subject of compassion. I know why me? Not sure why either! Richard is a very generous person and he chairs an amazing organization called <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a href="http://friendsindeedpas.org/fid/" style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">Friends In Deed</a></strong></span>, which helps the most vulnerable people including the homeless. What convinced me was the breakfast was a benefit for Friends In Deed. And I was transported into another world.....Anyway here are my remarks I prepared and delivered to the 600+ assembled.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p class="asset-video"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7vWDO4nquZY?rel=0&amp;start=1814" width="560"></iframe></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>I’d like to thank Richard Cheung and Friends In Deed for the extraordinary work they do, and thanks to Mayor Tornek for the invitation to be here, for your leadership, and vision for a better Pasadena. And thank you—all of you—for coming here today and spending your valuable time to be together; and to express our unity, connection to one another.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>I’m here to be a little bit of a catalyst, a little bit of verbal caffeine, a little bit of a wake-up call, about things you already know, things that are already inside of you—things that we need to stir. My job today is just to shift your perspective a little bit, to consider again, how do we build a better community.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Isn’t it nice to just to stop and pause from the speed of life. And take a breath. &nbsp; &nbsp; Let's breathe.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>Breathe in the mountain and breathe out flowers.</strong></em></span></em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>I think about my family and want them to know how grateful I am for their love and support. Sarah, Jenna, Malia, Bobby. In preparing these remarks, I thought of my grandparents when they came to this country with nothing but dreams of a better life, arrived on boats to work on the railroad and to work on the farms in the San Joaquin valley; to pursue the American Dream. I think about my parents, Rod and Tomi Kobara, who both passed away in the last two years, living very full lives achieving the American Dream. And 75 years ago, this week in northern California, they were rounded up by the government—because of Executive Order 9066 that declared all Japanese residents of the United States to be enemy aliens—and 120,000 other JA citizens were put into concentration camps. They were deprived of all their possessions, rights and opportunities for almost four years. Ironically, they emerged out of that process with a stronger desire to prove that they were Americans, to provide a better opportunity for me and my siblings. <strong>I’m inspired by my family every day, and the great sacrifices all our ancestors made for us to be here.</strong></em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Proud of which the Japanese American community bonded with the American Muslim community, since 911, to prevent such a shameful part of our history from repeating itself. Today, more than ever, we ALL need to be part of this effort.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>I think about Young Sook Kim, my mother-in-law, whom I never met, who escaped from North Korea to go to South Korea when she was a teenager yearning for freedom. She started doing the wash and feeding GIs during the Korean War, and ultimately married one of those GIs. She came to the United States and had to learn the language and culture and got her bachelors, masters and her PhD in anthropology and became a college professor—she embodies the American Dream. Her life&nbsp;inspires me. She died at the age of 48. Her legacy was to afford her two children, and her three grandchildren she never met, a better chance.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>That’s all any of us are asking for, is a chance. An opportunity. A fair chance, and when that chance exists we have hope, but when that chance doesn’t exist, we lose hope. And when we lose hope, we lose everything.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>We’re all losing hope. We are surrounded by an ocean of suffering and it is &nbsp;overwhelming. Each time we say: There’s only so much we can do--We lose hope. And we can think we are just drops in that ocean. We get used to it. The more comfortable we get, we become numb and disconnected from our fellow humans and our sense of humanity.&nbsp; <strong>An excerpt from a poem I wrote</strong>:</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Comfortable?</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Very</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Too comfortable?</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Perhaps</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Why do you ask?</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Comfort is nice</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Good for you, but we need to talk</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>About what we should do</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Now is a good time</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Time</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Got plenty of that</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Choices</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Got plenty of those</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>I know</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>I know what I want</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>But do I want what I know?</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Why are we here?</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Where are we going?</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>What difference can we make?</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Endless unanswered questions</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Does it matter?</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Aren’t we comfortable?</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Yes, very</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>But, we need to talk!</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Talk?</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>That's what we’re doing</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Again</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>So how do we <strong>comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable</strong>? How do we reinvigorate our sense of compassion? Because sympathy is arrogant, and empathy is always insufficient. How do we reinvigorate our compassion? For compassion comes from the root, passio or pati, which means “to suffer.” How do we suffer with others? That’s what compassion means. How do we suffer together? Mother Teresa says, “<strong>If we have no peace, it’s because we have forgotten we belong to one another</strong>.” And we have less peace, because we have forgotten a lot. We sit here politely and calmly, while the current state of our world is in crises, our communities are broken, people are suffering, the needs of others are out of control-we can feel helpless and hopeless. Even a generous and kind group like you, begin to think it is impossible to give and do more.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>I am fascinated, energized, my optimism is renewed over our untapped potential, the possibilities within each one of us. Gandhi said, <strong>the difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve the world's problems.<br> </strong>Kierkegaard called it our Sealed Orders; epigenetics, the new &nbsp;neuroscience, is studying our&nbsp;unexpressed DNA; Nikki Giovanni, the great poet says, “<strong>You know, we’re better than we think, but we’re not as good as we could be</strong>.” And Bonnie Ware, who studied the regrets of the dying, found the number one regret of people who were dying in hospice—<strong> I wish I had the courage to have lived a life that was true to me, and not a life that was the expectations of others</strong>.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>A man named Dōgen came to Japan almost 800 years ago to teach Zen Buddhism. Zen Buddhism is about living the full life, the fully expressed life they call it the Supreme Meal. He wrote a book called, Instructions to the Cook. Literally the recipe for the Supreme Meal. The Supreme Meal is what we need to make every day, and every week and every month and every year, in our entire lives. <strong>The Supreme Meal is the best we can make with everything we have—and we have everything we need. </strong>We live in great abundance, and have every ingredient we need to make this Supreme Meal, and yet we fail to use all of our ingredients.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>No matter our point of view, what side we sit on, we agree that the status quo is unacceptable. That the suffering around us is intolerable. We need a supreme meal of hope, equity, and opportunity. I am talking about using all of our ingredients: Our moral, spiritual, emotional, intellectual, and financial resources. Putting our full reputations, our social networks, our minds and hearts into the changes that are necessary. <strong>This is an All-In MOMENT. A moment to use everything we have.</strong></em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>My mother was a great painter. She painted 1,430 original art pieces during her lifetime. She started painting when she was 48 and painted all the way until her final year of life.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>I asked for an art lesson; I asked her to teach me how to paint, and she laughed. In a knowing way, she said, “Oh John, I love the fact that you want to learn to paint, but you’re so busy, and you’re so important, at least that’s what you’ve told me. And it takes time to see before you can paint; and if you can’t see, there’s no way you can paint! And you don’t have time to see.” She finally agreed to give me a "seeing" lesson. She told me it would take at least three hours to see. She started asking me questions about these apples. And I couldn’t see the apples, I tell you, it was hours. And I finally saw the apples, and she mis-quoted Cezanne, “<strong>A time is coming when apples, freshly observed, will trigger a revolution.</strong>” Actually, he said, “<strong>A time is coming when a carrot freshly observed will trigger a revolution.</strong>”</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>And it did. I started to see things. I started to see myself and so much around me. We have so much more to see. We tend to focus on the path and where our feet are leading us, and the path becomes a path of dependency, of certainty. We don’t listen to our hearts. We miss the peripheral view, we miss what’s around us who’s around us, we miss what’s going on right now.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>The challenge is in every moment and the time is always now.</strong>&nbsp; James Baldwin</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>So, I have been trying to shift your perspective, to help us think about who we are, and why we are here, and where we’re going. We’re the only species on the planet that gets to ask the question, What do I want to do? Who am I? No other species gets to do that. We must take advantage of this opportunity. <strong>How do we unseal our orders, express our DNA, become better than we are? And have the courage to live a life that is true to ourselves and to others. </strong></em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>We can never forget our ancestors who sacrificed for all of us.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>How do we comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable?</strong></em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>The giant ocean of needs breaks our hearts, but we need our hearts to be broken open!</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Open to our interconnectedness, inter-dependency. Open to our abundant possibilities.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>While we sometimes feel like drops in the ocean, we realize we’re the entire ocean in every drop. (Rumi)</strong></em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>I know that what I am asking is impossible. But in our time, as in every time, the impossible is the least that one can demand — and one is, after all, emboldened by the spectacle of human history in general, and American Negro history in particular, for it testifies to nothing less than the perpetual achievement of the impossible. (James Baldwin)</strong></em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>So, we pause to breathe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Breathe in the mountain and breathe our flowers.</strong></em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>Breathe in your power and breathe out your kindness</strong></em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>So we can have peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, Yes!&nbsp; Yes! Yes! &nbsp;&nbsp;We do belong to one another!</strong></em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>And once we can see, see this potential, it triggers a revolution. <strong>For we need, desperately need, your revolutions!</strong> We have every ingredient to make that Supreme Meal. That revolutionary meal. That meal of hope—together.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>C’mon let’s join Mayor Tornek, Richard Cheung, Friends In Deed, so all of us can begin making and serving that Supreme Meal today! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Thank you.</em></span></p>

         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d2491aab970c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Teacups" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b8d2491aab970c img-responsive" height="297" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d2491aab970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Teacups" width="407"></a><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We have had our little obsession with teacups. Many of us have used, "Not my cup of tea." Originally meant for an unpleasant pain in the arse :) person but applied generally to all things less desirable. &nbsp;Or "a tempest in a teacup", the lesser used and perhaps later concocted version of "a tempest in a teapot". &nbsp;Or George Orwell's rant on a nice<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a href="http://orwell.ru/library/articles/tea/english/e_tea" style="color: #0000ff;">&nbsp;cup of tea</a></strong></span>.&nbsp;But a "cup of tea" was to describe someone you like or think is good.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In this regard, my mother was a special cup of tea.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Many of you know my mother left us last June. She was a remarkable woman who shaped my point of view and my life direction. But if you are a regular reader or have listened to one of my speeches, you know this!&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Anyhow, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2015/10/can-we-see-our-futures-1.html " style="color: #0000ff;">my mother was a prolific artist</a></strong></span> and created complex oil paintings in minutes or took weeks and months to perfect a painting. She was both a conceptual artist (think Picasso) and an experimental artist (think Cezanne). Cezanne's work may have been her most important muse.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Like many artists she had her secrets. Her techniques. Her way of painting that were hers. The real meaning of her pieces were left to the viewer's imagination. As they say, "Art is in the eye of the beholder." Perspective is everything. No two people see anything the same.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">My mother was a prankster with a wicked sense of humor. Some say I got my sense of humor from her, many others have hired a search party for my funny bone. Here is my mother’s last enigmatic prank--That will never be solved.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Years ago, she created a set of paintings of teacups, 15 in all. Somehow they were assembled into a single print—the exact origins are unknown. And where the original of this print went is also a mystery. There are no known copies of this painting, only this low quality photo shown above. With a twinkle in her eye, she told us that each unique teacup depicted her four children and her ten siblings and&nbsp;herself. That adds up to 15. She would never reveal the identities of the teacups! &nbsp;It is hard to see, but there are unique differences in the teacups. One is cracked, one covered, one upside down, one on its side.....Your interpretations start to go wild. </span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This was all years ago and we had all forgotten these enigmatic teacups.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">After Mom passed I went to the print shop where she made reproductions, so called giclees, of her work. It was an emotional meeting. Like all people that knew and/or worked with my mother, the print shop owner had bonded with <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c8c25d4b970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Teacups 3" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b7c8c25d4b970b img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c8c25d4b970b-750wi" style="width: 733px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Teacups 3"></a>her. After we cried together and exchanged stories, he revealed, in his moment of weakness, that he had taken an unauthorized photo of the teacups. My sister Katie and I were aghast. No one in our family ever saw this version. We asked for a copy and ultimately received this higher resolution image:<br></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You can see right away this is different from the original, the order is changed and now there are 16! The new teacup is the one broken into pieces (bottom row).</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Who is the 16th teacup?!!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We will never know the exact symbolism or identities of the teacups or solve the mystery of the new broken one. But that is the beauty of art and of life as lived and painted by my mother—all to be interpreted. I know she is smiling and perhaps giggling a bit from on high.&nbsp;<br></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">My sister Tomi found this poem just after we made this discovery: <strong><em>A cup is more valuable chipped. He was broken. I am broken. And when we can see that we are all chipped and broken, we begin to value our life as an expression of the teaching that we are truly perfect and complete, just as we are.</em></strong> —Pat Enkyo O’hara</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Each teacup is special and beautiful.</span></p> 
          <p><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We know that any fixed, perfect and pristine image we have of ourselves or others is an imaginary teacup.&nbsp;</span></strong></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">My mother knew we would see ourselves in every teacup. For we are all of the teacups. Our cupboards house each one of these cups. For we are many things, have been many things and will be many things. Our histories and our destinies are complex and unknowable. We contain the infinite seeds of our family trees and experiences. All of us will never fully express our potential and our possibilities. </span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">So our humanity, our compassion, and our future depends on exploring and embracing our own and each other's teacups.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Here's to our beautiful and mysterious cups of tea in 2017.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Thanks Mom. And thanks for reading. John</span></p>

         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">One of the most remarkable things in life is how wrong we are about our perceptions. That almost everything upon closer examination yields insights and new truths. Especially people, places, cultures, religions, and lifestyles we are not familiar with. The constant process of learning what we don't know empirically.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">One of my newer heroes is <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Stevenson" style="color: #0000bf; text-decoration: underline;">Bryan Stevenson</a></strong></span>. He has devoted his life to justice. Called the American Mandela, Stevenson is ripping back the curtain of mass incarceration and the pernicious legacy of racism. His Tedtalk, his latest book <em>Just Mercy</em> are to be added to your must experience list. His <strong><span style="color: #0000bf;"><a href="https://youtu.be/BDtfceDkeJ8" style="color: #0000bf;">acceptance speech</a></span></strong>&nbsp;earlier this year for the 2016 Public Counsel awards dinner is among the best speeches I have ever heard. And I have seen and studied my share!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">His speech is anchored on four principles to pursue change and greater understanding of difference. A fabulous structure to test our thinking about worlds we think we comprehend, people we think we know, and places we think we understand. This is how I interpret Bryan's advice:</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Proximate</strong>: We have to get physically close to needs, issues, and people to learn the truth through reality. I know this sounds obvious, but much of our perspective about "homelessness", "refugees", "poverty", "Cuba", "black people" and "socialism" are gleaned through abstract and "distant" information.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Narrative:&nbsp;</strong>We have a story running in our head about these issues, ideas and people. These stories are reinforced through selective consumption, our biases, and with the limitations of&nbsp;empirical data. &nbsp;How do we disrupt this story with facts and experiences?&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Uncomfortable:&nbsp;</strong>When we disrupt our cranial narratives with facts then we get shoved out of our comfort zones--we get understandably uncomfortable. Truth is the greatest source of discomfort, especially when it conflicts with our long held belief system. Discomfort wakes us up and we have to use our brains and think and feel again. Being uncomfortable is a necessary step in our journey to learn and grow.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Hopeful</strong>: Gaining new perspectives through experience, opening new parts of our minds to new truths, and seeing new possibilities expands our hopefulness. Because when we learn new things we see how change is possible and that expands the pool of hope.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(Yes I have changed the order of these principles for my own purposes :)</span></p>

            Me and Congresswoman Karen Bass
           </div> 
          </div> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I recently was included on a special study tour of Cuba led by Congresswoman <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Bass" style="color: #0000bf; text-decoration: underline;">Karen Bass</a>&nbsp;</strong></span>(One of the most dedicated public servants I have encountered)&nbsp;It was a mind blowing learning experience that changed me. I reflect on Stevenson's principles that helped me re-think everything "I knew" about Cuba. Except the food, music, art, rum and cigars, which are exquisite and met and exceeded my expectations!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">US-Cuban relations have been&nbsp;so tortured and convoluted through hundreds of years of&nbsp;American history. We have viewed and treated Cuba as a possession and territory for generations&nbsp;prior to the revolution which triggered the ongoing embargo. Then Cuba was perceived as a &nbsp;threat. Not enough space here to provide or review history. Suffice it to say that the US has imposed its will on this island country for the last 50 years.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We rarely think about Cuba, yet the Cuban people are big fans of Americans. We were greeted by colleagues and strangers with open arms and warm friendliness. I know, it is about the historic antagonistic systems and governments. It is about capitalism vs socialism. And&nbsp;Fidel vs JFK. Here's the deal, that was then and Cuba does not resemble those caricatures of the past. Globalization is here&nbsp;and Cuba has been benched and ostracized. This embargo is not just a political war of words it has really hurt the people. 50 years of no access to anything from the US from anywhere. That includes school materials, medicine and food. I know it was meant to punish the country, but that time passed and it is harming people who pose no threat to us today. As an embargoed country, Cuba is in the same company with North Korea, Iran, Ukraine and Syria. It makes no sense now. It hasn't for many years.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Everything I knew about Cuba was transformed by a closer examination.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> The President Obama&nbsp;lifted some sanctions, travel and certain goods are no longer prohibited, but we need to open up our relationship to take full advantage of what Cuba has to offer. Cuban medical training is the envy of the world. They have free medical care from pre-natal to hospice. For example, Cuba has a robust bio-tech industry and have developed a drug called Cimavax which attacks lung cancer cells. NY state now has a few trials of Cimavax, the first medical exchange in 50 years!&nbsp;</span></p>

By the way, Cuba's literacy rate is about 97%. In fact they have a Museum of Literacy! We visited <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #0000bf;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELAM_(Latin_American_School_of_Medicine)_Cuba" style="color: #0000bf; text-decoration: underline;">ELAM</a>&nbsp;</span></strong></span><span style="color: #0000bf;"><span style="color: #111111;">(Latin American Medical School) where students from 110 countries receive free medical training. Free room and board and a stipend! We met a number of US students there who are receiving a world class education centered on the patient. Cuba is famous for providing doctors to Haiti, Africa, and other disaster torn countries.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #0000bf;"><span style="color: #111111;">As ethno-centric Americans we worried when every corner has a McDonalds, KFC and Starbucks....... It was interesting not to see Coca Cola there. We asked about these changes, which we thought were inevitable. We heard that they don't need Coca Cola, they have "sugar water". Or more burgers, chicken or coffee... They need infrastructure, pharma, hotels, car parts, educational materials---many many things. We want to get the things we need before we add things we don't. <strong>"We don't want to add to the <em>war of symbols</em>."</strong> Wow!! Television programs are not interrupted by commercials, except public service announcements and education--mostly health oriented. Yes I know, we have more choices. But we have a lot of noise and interruptive messages &nbsp;too. How would we change our system if we could?</span></span></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #0000bf;"><span style="color: #111111;">Cuba has many challenges. Poverty is rampant. Inequality is there. Sound familiar? The aforementioned infrastructure is in disrepair or non-existent. But there is a spirit of humanity, of ingenuity, of compassion, and of camaraderie that needs to breathe and grow. US Cuban relations can flourish with great reciprocal benefits to the US and the world.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #0000bf;"><span style="color: #111111;">As Bryan Stevenson advised: proximity changed my narrative, made me uncomfortable, but even more hopeful. <strong>Like all life changing experiences you understand&nbsp;one another, you appreciate our interconnectedness and commonalities. Somos Cubanos! </strong></span></span></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #0000bf;"><span style="color: #111111;">I encourage you to test your own assumptions, by visiting Cuba, &nbsp;or anywhere or any population you&nbsp;think you know, but don't. As John Wooden said, "<strong>It is what you learn after you know it all that counts."</strong></span></span></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: #0000bf;"><span style="color: #111111;">Thanks for reading. John</span></span></span></p>

         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p>For those who&nbsp;know me, I quote my mother often. Her words and advice have shaped my life and my aspirations.</p> 
          <p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb0931d4c3970d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Lanikai dreams 7.14.16" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301bb0931d4c3970d img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb0931d4c3970d-500wi" style="width: 499px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Lanikai dreams 7.14.16"></a><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb0931d444970d-pi"></a>One of her most memorable quotes is:</p> 
          <p><strong>Breathe in the mountain</strong></p> 
          <p><strong> and breathe out flowers.</strong></p> 
          <p>It is a powerful phrase to me and my family. It speaks to my mother's zen spirituality, her inner strength, her creative force and her focus on the good and positive.&nbsp;Think about this phrase.</p> 
          <p>Say it as you breathe in and out. What does it feel like? What does it mean to you?</p> 
          <p>This was one of the very last phrases my mother said to me. Like a reminder of what was important, a reminder of her teachings. I said it back to her so she knew I understood.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>Below is a an excerpt of my thoughts about what this phrase means to me:&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">My parents built a bedrock of love and support beneath our family</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;"><br>We stand on a Mountain of gratitude and enjoy the Flowers of their generosity</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Breathe in the mountain and breathe out flowers</strong></p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&nbsp;Breathe in the mountain and breathe out flowers&nbsp;</strong></p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>In many ways my Dad is the mountain</strong></p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Silent and overbearing</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Powerful, ominous and strong</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Never moving, but almost undetectably shifting and evolving</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Clouds gone, the mountain appears.</strong> (Zen proverb)</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">He cast a long shadow, a Japanese Nisei shadow, the shadow of the Samurai</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">A shadow of unspoken expectations</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">A shadow of protection</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">A shadow of love</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>And my mother is the flowers</strong></p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Flowers never fail or disappoint you</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Flowers always brighten your way</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Flowers flirt and bring you peace</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Flowers are always kind, always</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">They want your attention but never demand it</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">The flowers we breathe out are the flowers of our&nbsp;best selves</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Our most loving, openhearted, compassionate and generous selves</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A single flower can redeem the loneliness of a room.&nbsp; Like a single soul can illuminate the world.</strong></p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">It is always about our humility. Our understanding of our commonness.</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">That we are but a small part of the world and yet can&nbsp;make a difference everyday.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">It is&nbsp;noticing the world through love and kindness.</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Find the seed at the bottom of your heart and bring forth a flower.&nbsp;</strong>(Shigenori Kameoka)</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Mountains are our values and our identity from our ancestors who suffered and sacrificed and gave us destiny.</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Flowers remind us of the seasons, of time, of our sensuousness, of our inner potential to bloom.</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">I have the mountain and the flowers in me. We all do.</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Everyday I try, I try to breathe in the power of the mountain and everyday I try to breathe out the fragrance of the flowers.</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">And for a fleeting flicker of a moment, I become my mother and my father, reminded of who I am and who I can be.</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">We all have mountains and flowers.</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Why does it take death for us to come together, to make us appreciate what we have and who we are?</strong></p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Because this is part of life. Our time is precious and short. Never too late. To pay attention to things, to know ourselves, and love one another and why we are here.</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A time is coming when a flower freshly observed will trigger a revolution. </strong>(Cezanne)</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">That time is today.</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">So how do we &nbsp;freshly observe our mountains and flowers--and trigger our own revolutions?!</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Let's breathe together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One big breath together</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Breathe in the mountain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And breathe out flowers.</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;">Thanks for reading. John</p>

         <h5 class="date-header font-dateheader"> <span class="entry-date"><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2016/07/comforting-each-other.html">July 06, 2016</a></span> </h5> 
         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What do we say when there is a tragedy, a death, something really bad happens to people we care about?&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Most of us are acutely aware of our own struggles and we are preoccupied with our own problems. We sympathize with ourselves because we see our own difficulties so clearly. But Ian MacLaren noted wisely, <strong>“Let us be kind to one another, for most of us are fighting a hard battle.”</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">When I was younger I would try to draw on my capacity for&nbsp;empathy, but I had a fairly dry aquifer of emotional intelligence. Life, death, disease, and unexpected mishaps were frankly just part of the hand you were dealt. Our feline life expectancy dropped a year or two each chapter of our experience until we accept we have one life to live and it is very short.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">As we mature and age we are exposed to more suffering, more tragedy, more death. It is a jolting reminder of our mortality and the mortality of the ones around us. We feel more compelled to express our sympathies and condolences. To offer support to the survivors. We struggle with doing the right thing at the right time. We write notes, emails, sign cards, and say things to comfort family and friends. Sometimes we rely on Hallmark for the words, say or write the same thing we always say, or we do nothing. At least for me, &nbsp;it is an awkward process.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> What can I say? What should I say? What can I do? What should I do?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I have learned so much being the recipient of these communications. Nothing like learning about yourself by how you are treated.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The golden rule always applies. Say/do unto others as you would have them say/do unto you. What would comfort me?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">A rude awakening for me is how selfish I have been and others can be in trying to comfort each other. It is not about me. It never really is. But we&nbsp;can lead with "Me too", or "I know how you feel".&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>The oddity of our clumsy and sometimes hurtful attempts to help is this: we have clear ideas from what has helped us in our suffering, but we do not adopt it when seeking to love others. We do not always speak to others in the way we would like to be spoken to.</strong> &nbsp;Edward T. Welch</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I remember a comedy routine, where a distant friend goes up to the grieving mother of a murdered child at the vigil to pay his respects. He gets nervous, then tongued tied, and blurts out, "I apologize." &nbsp;Not the same as "I am sorry." :)</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What I learned and others have taught me--Less is more. Stop before you start into your robotic motor mouth routine. Put your well-intentioned pie hole on silent. Silence is better than words. A hug says more than any profound phrases. Everyone deals with grief and suffering in their&nbsp;own ways. But there is a universal understanding that your very presence is more powerful than anything&nbsp;you say.&nbsp; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c8788822970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Bearhug" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b7c8788822970b img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c8788822970b-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Bearhug"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">"I'm sorry." Is enough.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Again, stop and look both ways before you stick your foot in your "me too" mouth.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I really try to give people the benefit of the doubt. I hope people have done the same for me! A dear friend, expressed her condolences and tried to comfort me. Then she took the safety off of her verbal trigger and away she went. "Yeah, not a day goes by where I don't cry about my husband." I knew what she was trying to do, but it was our first conversation and the second thing she said.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">"How are you doing, today?" The today part is sensitive to what is happening. "How are you?" is auto-pilot and invokes the silent "How do you think I am?!!"</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Do not say: “If you need anything, please call me, anytime.” Another well intended thought but.........</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">– If ‘comforters’ knew anything about real hardship, they would know that sufferers usually don’t know what they want or need.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">– If comforters knew anything about the sufferer, they would know what the sufferer wants or needs.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">– If comforters really knew the sufferer, they would know that he or she would never make the call. Never. &nbsp;Tara Barthel</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In his book, "<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Reality-Slap-Finding-Fulfillment/dp/160882280X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=mind0a3-20" target="_blank">The Reality Slap</a>,</strong>" Russ Harris presents two lists — the first, a few responses that genuinely make you feel supported and understood; and the second, a number of responses that, although meant to be helpful, aren't really all that compassionate. Let's start with the less compassionate responses (many of which I myself am guilty of, and if we're being honest, most of us have said at times):</span></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Telling you to "think positively"</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Giving advice: "What you should do is this, "Have you thought about doing such and such?"</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Discounting your feelings: "No use crying over spilled milk," "It's not that bad," "Cheer up!"</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Trumping your pain: "Oh yes, I've been through this many times myself. Here's what worked for me."</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Telling you to get over it: "Move on," "Let it go," "Isn't it time you got over this?"</span></li> 
          </ul> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Here are some compassionate responses highlighted in Harris' book:</span></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Asking how you feel</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Giving you a hug, embrace, placing an arm around you or holding your hand</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Validating your pain: "This must be so hard for you" or "I can't begin to imagine what you're going through."</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Sharing their own reactions: "I'm so sorry, "I'm so angry," "I feel so helpless; I wish there was something I could do," or even "I don't know what to say."</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Creating space for your pain: "Do you want to talk about it?" It's OK to cry," or, "We don't have to talk; I'm happy to just sit here with you."</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Offering support: "Is there anything I can do to help?"</span></li> 
          </ul> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I took a thanatology class in college---Death and Dying. I learned about the 5 stages of dying that was asserted by <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_K%C3%BCbler-Ross" style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Elizabeth Kubler-Ross</strong></span></a></span>. Most of us have heard this. Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance. It made so much sense to me. It clearly applied to romantic break-ups :) But death? And the grieving?&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.onbeing.org/program/pauline-boss-the-myth-of-closure/8757" style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pauline Boss'</strong> </span></a></span>research disputes the application of these 5 stages to grief. That Kubler-Ross never intended to have them applied to grieving. We all want steps and stages. We want a linear routine to replace the organic reality. Boss' basic thought is closure for grief is a myth. While time heals, you will never be finished with your grief--and closure is only good in real estate. You don't want to forget or get over it. I know there are nuances here but really important ones.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This myth of closure has helped me be more sensitive, more compassionate. Time heals but never erases. I know this&nbsp;to be true.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">A colleague who did not know my Dad, said "Sorry to hear about your Dad. Tell me about him." I smiled, because I got to tell a Dad story and share my love and gratitude. For me, that was one of the nicest and most comforting things anyone said to me.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Part of building and maintaining a vibrant, authentic and altruistic network is our ability to connect to support one another. No time is more crucial than in times of loss and suffering.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Remind yourself what would comfort you. Stop, pause, and be present. Say less. Suppress your needs and surrender to the needs of the other. Good advice for all of us almost all of the time. <strong>Be kind: For we are all fighting great battles and carrying great burdens&nbsp;that are not known to one another.</strong> (my interpretation of Philo)</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Thanks for reading. John</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Nothing is enough for the man to whom enough is too little. </strong>Epicurus</span></p> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>A brand new college grad with his mortar board on says to me:&nbsp;</strong><em>Gotta get into grad school!</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Comment to me after my 94 year old uncle passed:&nbsp;</strong><em>So sorry he did not make it to 95</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Parents remark at their daughter's wedding:&nbsp;</strong><em>Now for my grandkids!</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>First question in an interview with me:&nbsp;</strong><em>How long do I have to do this job before I might get promoted?</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Never enough. Never good enough.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">One of the greatest distractions in life is this uneasy and ultimately sleep depriving feeling. It can motivate and haunt you. It can dominate our thinking and our actions. We see it in our social media, we see it in our credit card statements, we see it at work and talk about it with almost everyone. It is a silent and powerful under current that defines our lives. Wanting&nbsp;<em>MORE</em>. <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb090ecb66970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="More please" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301bb090ecb66970d img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb090ecb66970d-400wi" style="width: 400px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="More please"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some believe this constant desire and pursuit for <em>more</em> is rooted in our biology — that it helped us to survive. Some believe that this pursuit is fundamental to&nbsp;a capitalistic society that requires&nbsp;consumerism, propelled by the media, culture and of course, all of us aid and abet the crime of <em>MORE</em>.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is true that our survival instincts and competitive nature have brought us great progress and material luxuries. But when we lose ourselves to the MORE, that requires an intervention.</span></p> 
          <p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to Nobel Laureate&nbsp;Daniel Kahneman,&nbsp;income does predict happiness—but only up to $75,000 per year.</span></strong></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The infinite and never satiable goal of a bigger, better, and more expensive version. We do live in a&nbsp;Big Gulp, Super Size, Monster truck, Power Ball, &nbsp;iPhone 10, All you can eat, Botox filled world that is relentless and unyielding. It is an epidemic.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The yearning for life and wealth shows no signs of aging even as a man grows old. It does not weaken with age. It is a lifelong disease. The man who gives it up finds happiness.</strong> &nbsp;Dharmasutras</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I have come to appreciate <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://tidyingup.com/" style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Marie Kondo's</strong> </a></span>popular and simple advice about Tidying. I have read her book and saw her speak recently. For me the essence is--Look at your things, things you did not remember you have, so many things--Look at each one of them and ask, "Does this spark joy in me?" If it does not, then get rid of it. Give it away to someone who needs or wants it. We should be surrounded by things and people that spark joy in us, right?</span></p> 
          <p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>A desire arises in the mind. It is satisfied; immediately another comes. In the interval which separates two desires a perfect calm reigns in the mind. It is at this moment freed from all thought, love or hate. Complete peace equally reigns between two mental waves.</em></span></strong>– SWAMI SIVANANDA</p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Regardless of what we believe to be at the root of this constant wanting, it takes a conscious and deliberate effort to experience contentment or satisfaction in our lives — to fully appreciate life, people, and the activities we engage in. To stop and smell the roses, as my Dad used to say. To interrupt the impulses and the continuous thoughts that undermine our sense of self and the present.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yes meditation helps a lot. Anything to disrupt the pattern and bring the world back into focus.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">One of my favorite books is <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Instructions-Cook-Masters-Lessons-Matters/dp/0517888297" style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">Instructions to the Cook</a> </strong></span>describes the Zen Buddhist concept for the supreme meal. The <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2015/10/momentary-mentoring-fragility-of-your-choices-.html " style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">supreme meal</a></strong></span> is when we live our life fully, wholeheartedly---a fully expressed life.</span></p> 
          <p>So the first principle of the Zen cook is that we already have everything we need. If we look closely at our lives, we will find that we have all the ingredients we need to prepare the supreme meal. At every moment, we simply take the ingredients at hand and make the best meal we can. It doesn’t matter how much or how little we have. The Zen cook just looks at what is available and starts with that.</p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">And&nbsp;we become what we say. We evolve into our narratives. So when we say <em>MORE</em>, to ourselves and to others, that's what we believe and that's what we become.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Happiness will never come to those who fail to appreciate what they already have.</strong>&nbsp;Buddha</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is most evident in interviews and conversations. How people always tell me&nbsp;they are looking to make a change because they want <em>more</em>. The most over-used term is "growth" followed by "opportunity". I have learned these are code words for more money. Some souls are looking for meaning and fulfillment, but most want the "opportunity to grow". &nbsp;Grow to do what or be what?!! We may&nbsp;never know.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here's what kills me. Many people have read the same blog posts :), received the same coaching and have the same routines, answers and presentations. And when the vast majority of the walking dead say, "I am looking for a place where I can (continue to) grow." I always ask, "What are your top priorities for personal and professional growth?" This is a stumper. The vast majority of people I meet say that the cause, the issue, even the industry "doesn't matter"!!! I wish I was kidding. They can't articulate what "more" they want. Money&nbsp;is embedded and hiding in these abstract thoughts of more. But what is most often avoided is any self awareness, authenticity, and or introspectiveness to identify what <em>more</em> they want to become. </span></p> 
          <p><span style="color: #111111;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>More</em>&nbsp;is superficial when disconnected from the "P" words of passion and purpose.</span></strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How much is enough?</span></p> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>The Illusion of More &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
          <p>Don't need a thing<br>To do our thing<br>We have what we need<br>To pursue what we heed <br>Everything before us<br>Nothing between us<br>The <em>more</em> of our world<br>Is the distraction<br>The less of ourselves<br>Is the attraction <br>When we forget me<br>We build on the we</p> 
          <p>The <em>more</em> takes from the now<br>It carries us to the next<br>Without gratitude or grace<br>It abruptly changes our place<br>For here is this moment<br>So full and complete<br>It's a shame we might waste it<br>So we can compete<br>For the <em>more</em> of tomorrow<br>And miss this special&nbsp;time<br>Are we deaf to the music<br>And what's left of this&nbsp;rhyme</p> 
          <p>No things is our aim<br>In the end<br>We are all the same &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jek</p> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There are a few <em>MOREs</em>&nbsp;that deserve our attention:</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">More peace and social justice</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">More time with people we&nbsp;love</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">More solitude, silence, and soul&nbsp;nourishment</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">More effort to be kind and non-judgmental</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">More altruism where we&nbsp;give and help without any expectation</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">More joy, awe, and wonder.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let's enjoy what we have . Let's find and nurture the spark of joy around us. Let's interrupt the nonsensical wanting impulses. No more.&nbsp;</span></p>

Third, never look back and embrace the decision!&nbsp; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d1ef351f970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Chinese-Bamboo-Forest" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b8d1ef351f970c img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d1ef351f970c-450wi" style="width: 444px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Chinese-Bamboo-Forest"></a></span></p>

         <h5 class="date-header font-dateheader"> <span class="entry-date"><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2016/04/uncomfortable-comfort.html">April 18, 2016</a></span> </h5> 
         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Words mean a lot to me. Perhaps more as I age. I value the meaning of the words we choose and use. People who know me well understand that certain words set me off. My bans on "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="Permalink: http://www.swiveltime.com/2014/09/you-busy-the-b-word-1.html Edit">busy</a></strong></span>", "when I retire...", "stability" are well documented.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I push myself, and others who will listen, to "play out of bounds" and to not compromise our dreams. Why are we not pursuing what is most important to us? What obstacles prevent us to live the life we want? Am I where I am supposed to be? Are our networks diverse or a bunch of people who are clones --eating, voting, entertaining, agreeing, liking, the same stuff?&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">My goal is to disrupt the mindlessness of our lives. Where we accept and tolerate what we have and don't want.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I was conducting a session with graduate students about career transitions and got this question: "How long should I be <em>uncomfortable</em>?" It was a great question. Because it was honest. It was a vulnerable question. It was a question about the searching and certainty. After all when you are grad school procrastinating your future :), you think a lot about the land of career clarity. If we are contemplating change in our lives, if we are paying attention to the world around us,&nbsp;we all are trying to get to this mystical land of clarity.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">When we are open to what we don't know, when we are open to opportunities that we had not considered, when we become vulnerable to questions and conversations that change us----we get uncomfortable.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d1c67c2e970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Get-comfortable-being-uncomfortable-7" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b8d1c67c2e970c img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d1c67c2e970c-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Get-comfortable-being-uncomfortable-7"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Comfort the Afflicted and&nbsp;Afflict the Comfortable.</strong> F. Peter Dunne</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Perhaps my theme song! And definitely my favorite quote.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In other words, I am not where I want to be. I am not sure where I am going. I feel stuck or I crave more certainty about my path. I want more meaning, fulfillment and a greater sense of purpose. I need an answer to give me comfort.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">So here's my answer:</span></p> 
          <p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">You should never be comfortable. Never.</span></strong></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In terms of life and career development.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Yes, we should smell the roses, appreciate our milestones and yes let's have gratitude.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">But before we get too caught up in our greatness, drunk with our achievements, and light headed with thankfulness--let's consider the infinite challenge of serving others. Let's pause and consider our ambitions for our families and ourselves. Let's truly understand that we are not satisfied with our inner or outer lives. So stability is a joke. Certainty is a unicorn.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">How do you continuously pursue your own growth and that means your ability to help others?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">You can join the growing NIMBY family or what I call the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href=" http://www.swiveltime.com/2010/07/nimby-networks.html ">OIMBY</a></strong></span> tribe (Only In My Backyard)--where you take care of your immediate family and everyone else is on their own.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We have to be uncomfortable with our comfort.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>We now face the danger, which in the past has been the most destructive to the humans: Success, plenty, comfort and ever-increasing leisure. No dynamic people has ever survived these dangers.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">John Steinbeck&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The status quo sucks! Am I right? The world is not quite right. We&nbsp;are still filling out the breadth of our potential. Our families are a work in progress. Our communities are in great need. The world is at the brink of challenge and change.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">When we stop and think about what we can do, what we have to advance our lives and the lives of others, and consider the obscene abundance in which we reside----We can get uncomfortable. :)</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Once you accept that our work is infinite. That our role is to advance the work and give the next gen a chance to continue the work. That can give you a modicum of comfort. But then you realize, as I do everyday, life is short. We don't know when our ticket will be punched. So what will I do today?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Don't misunderstand me. Lack of comfort is not lack of peace. Inner peace comes with understanding one's role and opportunity. Inner peace comes with serving others. True peace is the product of an altruistic life of compassion. And compassion literally means to suffer with others. So we come full circle to an <em>uncomfortable</em> peace.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Our truth stands in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href=" http://www.swiveltime.com/2011/01/entering-or-leaving-the-doors-of-fear-and-opportunity.html">doorways</a></strong></span> in front of us, doorways that excite, invite, and frighten us. </span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Have I afflicted you?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Here's to your uncomfortable peace. Thanks for reading. John</span></p>

         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Infants don't understand the&nbsp;concept of permanence. It is an essential stage of cognitive and sensory motor skill development. We have all done this with little kids. We hide our faces with our hands and then reveal our faces and say Peek a Boo! And the kids&nbsp;are astonished and amazed. Like a magic trick. They laugh uncontrollably because of the surprise.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">And when toddlers cover their faces, they think they are invisible.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">When we grow up we are still confused about what&nbsp;is real. We think we are invisible. As adults we hide our own faces and our feelings We become quite clever in masking our true selves. And the mask can become the face. <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c81c582e970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Peekaboo" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b7c81c582e970b img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c81c582e970b-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Peekaboo"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">I meet many people at many points in their lives. Junctions, detours, shifts, inflection points, crossroads--all names for the same thing---Life! Every moment considering choices is about change. Anyway, I try to use these moments to see if I get clues about what they really want. Poker players call it the "tell". A sign given off by facial expression, body tics, and or inflection that gives away a truth. </span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">I recently met with a younger man and he was babbling on about who he was and his impressive background ( I remember when I use to show up and throw up) He said, "I want to help people." (When I hear this it takes every ounce of my control not to say, "Yeah "people" that narrows your career choices!") Instead I said "Which people?" And after a series of these back and forths. He spoke eloquently about "helping people overcome what he&nbsp;had overcome." I stopped him and asked him to tell me how he felt. I told him how I felt. It was pretty emotional. His eyes, inflection and body language did all of the talking. And we built a small rhetorical campfire and sat down to explore this personal story. He thought I read his mind, but he opened his book and read from his heart. I was moved.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"><strong>That honesty about what matters gives me a view of what I think is the soul. The true self who hides in the costume and mask department of our minds.</strong> It is a bit of a game of hide and seek I play with others and myself. To get the souls to come out and play and share.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">It reminds me to be vulnerable and empathetic in the way I listen and think. It helps me immensely. And I know it has an impact on others and the dimensions of conversation that ensue.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">I am convinced that we unconsciously let others and ourselves&nbsp;suppress so much of our potential and our soulfulness. The heavy blanket of expectations, political correctness, not looking stupid, not making other people uncomfortable, not being good enough etc etc.</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"><em>My research shows that we are too busy connecting to have the conversations that count, the kind of conversation in which we give each other our full attention, the kind where we allow an idea to develop, where we allow ourselves to be vulnerable. Yet these are the kinds of conversations in which intimacy and empathy develop, collaboration grows, and creativity thrives. We move from conversation to mere connection. And I worry that sometimes we forget the difference. Or forget that this is a difference that matters.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">In our daily conversations, it starts with so called small talk, exchanges where we move our lips and sounds tumble out of our pie holes. Classic example is "How are you?" and you reply reflexively, "Fine. You?" and&nbsp;a thousand unthinking variations. But our robotic chatter is not limited to these informal seemingly meaningless verbal transactions. They now consume most of our time. Like bad texting exchanges that say nothing. <strong>We&nbsp;partake&nbsp;in a lot of live face to face superficial texting through our mouths.&nbsp;</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">We say words and others say words we neither listen to or fully comprehend what pablum spews back and forth. It is not that we are uncaring souls, but we have rehearsed our routines like inadequate amateur versions of Robin Williams' improv group of personalities. We pull something from our inner&nbsp;hard drive and it plays without much thought.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">How do we disrupt this pattern if we want to have more interesting and meaningful conversations? How do we show our empathy and compassion for one another? Who starts the real conversation?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Do we have the time and patience? Do we?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">And yet we want help. We crave and cry out for mentoring for guidance for support--on our terms, just in time, convenient, fast and simple to assemble. We want life and career advice that comes out of an IKEA box, or fits into a 3 minute YouTube. Not a revealing conversation.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Love <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000bf; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://spiritawakening.org/?page_id=121" style="color: #0000bf; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Akuyoe Graham's</strong> </a></span></span>advice to me about <em>enjoying the taste of the words</em>. Meaning that you take the time and thought to savor what you say. You sense the words you speak, their weight, their intention and you convey those thoughts with your face and your body. </span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Am I there, present, vulnerable, open, attentive, listening, more interested than interesting?</strong> That matters. And can make way to real&nbsp;conversations.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Theodore Zeldin from his book <span style="color: #0000bf; text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Conversation-How-Talk-Change-Lives/dp/1587680009" style="color: #0000bf; text-decoration: underline;">Conversation How talk can change our lives</a>:</strong></span></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"><em>Conversation is a meeting of minds&nbsp;with&nbsp;different memories and habits. When minds meet, they just don't exchange facts: they transform them, reshape them, draw different implications from them, engage in new trains of thought. Conversation doesn't reshuffle the cards, it creates new cards. It's a spark that two minds create.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">How many conversations do we have like that? Wouldn't that be good?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">In my analysis this real conversation is a meeting of the minds and a&nbsp;meeting of the souls.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">It takes both sides to make this happen.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Peek&nbsp;a&nbsp;boo (excerpt from my poem)</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I see you</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Then&nbsp;you’re gone</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I see what you want to be, what you try to be</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I see what you want me to see</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I saw something</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The glint of the sun through the clouds</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I felt you</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">A&nbsp;warm breeze on a summer eve</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Something real and fleeting</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Like a poltergeist</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The warmth and chill of presence</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I feel you</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Peek&nbsp;a&nbsp;boo</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">But just like that you disappear</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">From right in front to out of sight</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Are you gone or just hiding?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">What are you afraid of?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When will I see you again?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Maybe it’s me</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Am I scaring you?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Peek a boo</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I see me</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Like a mirror image</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">That glimpse of you was a glimpse of me</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I want what you want</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">And your words are the words I want</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I hear me through you</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Peek&nbsp;a&nbsp;boo</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">You are changing me</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Am I changing you?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">An open heart opens the mind</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We are changed</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We try to be invulnerable and see no flaw</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We become vulnerable and see the light</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Peek a boo</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I learn from you</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When I was teaching you</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Peek a boo</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">You mentor me</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When I was trying to mentor you</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">You helped me&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Did I help you?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Peek a boo</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I saw you</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">And you see me</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I need you</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">And you need me</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Come out to play and let’s be &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John E.

          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">We must help others and ourselves explore and share our truths, our souls.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">If we see it, acknowledge it, welcome it. And embrace it.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Build a campfire and listen to each other's stories. We have so much to learn from one another.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Thanks for reading.&nbsp;</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What if you looked at your life sideways? Just saw it differently for a moment. How about your relationships? How about your career?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Not abandoning what you have but getting a new perspective so you can appreciate what is there. We all live in great abundance of things and opportunities that we neglect in our haste to the next. <strong>We often misinterpret busyness for pursuit of what we want</strong>--progress towards happiness or fulfillment. When we pause and reflect, we can realize the error of our ways. It is hard to do this by yourself.&nbsp;</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">When we slow down and take stock of where we are going and why--it can be transformative. We have to be open to truthful feedback and a <em>sideways perspective</em> (a new point of view), we can learn something. Great mentoring happens when you suspend your defensiveness, your desire to say the "right" thing, and your ever present judgmentalism. Your eyes and mind, dare I say, your heart can be&nbsp;opened to new truths.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Anyone who knows me, knows my mother has the uncanny ability to give me sideways views of myself. Over and over she has helped me see myself as opposed to the facades I was constructing.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">But then it happened to mom! She got a sideways lesson. Her perspective was altered.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">My mom has been painting for decades and she continues to evolve. A few years ago she lost the cartilage in her right arm and paints on the floor so she doesn't have to lift her arm. This changes the shape and size of her canvases. She also decided to do more "abstract" work. So she started taking classes in her late 80s and got a mentor! Never too late to change and adapt.&nbsp;</span><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb08b1a848970d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="IMG_2501 (2)" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301bb08b1a848970d img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb08b1a848970d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="IMG_2501 (2)"></a></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">So my mom painted this mythical waterfall near rocks and a tree to the left.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Her teacher/mentor came to the house and wanted to see her newest things. My mom has been experimenting with more vertical&nbsp;forms. Anyway, my mother pulled out three paintings and leaned them against a wall, including this one. </span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Her teacher quickly turned two of the paintings on the side, converting my mom's vertical paintings into horizontals. (see below) My mother was astonished. "That IS the way it was&nbsp;supposed to be!, my mother exclaimed. And that is now the way it will be hung and sold. Of course the owner of the painting can do whatever they want, but what was the original intent of the artist? <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d196f11b970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="IMG_2501 (4)" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b8d196f11b970c img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d196f11b970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="IMG_2501 (4)"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">It is obvious to you, right? Everyone who sees this says that. Now before you doubt my story or my mother's intelligence (How dare you :)). Listen to me. My mother has painted more than 1400 originals. When she paints them she turns them around and views them from all sides. She has an eye like no one else. But like all of us she got stuck in her perspective, she needed help and was open to it.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>We all try to will the Ouija board of life. We intend things, we plan things, we set firm expectations.</strong> And when things end up differently we are disappointed and worse, we can defend the status quo. The way it is supposed to be, the tradition, the habit, and the comfortable way. No!<br></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">We have to be open to a sideways view of ourselves. We need help to see ourselves. We have to invest in seeing ourselves accurately.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The definition of insanity is --doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">We need help to change and adapt. Mentors, teachers, coaches, therapists, all are capable of showing us things they see that we can't. Caring for others can help us see ourselves and the world around us. Our biases, our distractions, and our egos limit what we see.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Stop for a moment to see your reflection and explore what is below the tension of the surface. Mentor&nbsp;the waterskeeters in our lives to see what they are missing. Look at your world&nbsp;sideways and you might see new horizontals in your verticals.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Thanks for reading. John</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The recipe is pretty straight forward. You take you with all of the expectations of others removed, add a big heaping tablespoon of courage, add extra chutzpah and then a pinch of regrets to taste and voila you get the real you.</span></p>

           <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Schedule little windows of time when you will develop your plans and yourself. Time to be focused and unfocused. Nothing will happen if you do not do this! What you need is inspiration. Which can come in a moment, any time, taking a shower, doing the dishes, taking a walk, meditating, reading. Fill your life with more stimulation, different voices, sources, points of view. Change it up. Shake it up. Find things that resonate with you that quicken your heart beat and put a lump in your throat. Then take notes and follow them.</span>

Worlds that understand your unanswered questions, your "crazy" dreams and your insecurities and doubts. Tribes that will mentor you.</span>

          <p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What I want for you is the delight that comes from doing what you want. Becoming you. Not merely the achievement of the financial or employment goals or even familial expectations. Yes do them. But make small, medium and large spaces for you. For when your passion bucket overflows everyone around you will get some. Whether you like it or not you infect others with your smile of delight, your glow of goodness, and your engaging enthusiasm for&nbsp;life.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p style="margin: 0px 0px 16px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">And when you are not yourself, when you are not smiling, and your passion bucket is empty--you also impact others, just very differently.&nbsp;</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">According to my unscientific survey, surrendering to the status quo starts earlier and younger.&nbsp;Settling sooner for what you can get and shelving what you wanted. I had a millennial call herself an "optimistic fatalist". "I really hope I am wrong, but I am not going to do what I want." &nbsp;It depresses me.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I am constantly and irritatingly asked:</span></p> 
          <p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> When do you move on to the next thing? At what point do I give up on my dreams?&nbsp;</span></strong></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">After one of my workshops I was pursued by an executive who sat at my lunch table. I'll call him Leonard. After listening to the small talk he blurted out some thoughts that were clearly percolating for awhile.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"So John, I get your message--do what you want and even love. I get it. I wish I could do it, I wish it was possible. You know most people just can't do that. People take the jobs they can get and they put up with the toxic worlds they enter to make a living.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Having a job you love is a fantasy."</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>You can fail at what you don't want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you&nbsp;love.&nbsp;Jim Carrey</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Leonard. Thanks for speaking up and challenging my words. I do not want to make any of this sound easy or simple. It isn't. Taking control of your life takes courage. Just to be clear, I was not suggesting that finding a job you love will be&nbsp;THE&nbsp;answer. But finding work you love, you believe in, that fulfills you is not a fantasy. It is achievable and doable. Of course, if you need a job to eat and survive, then you need a job and your tolerance for inhospitable environments is much higher. But I am talking about me and you. We are sitting in this nice hotel chatting about our futures. We are over educated and have choices. There are amazing things that people will pay you to do that may be more fulfilling and fun. But I was also talking about building a life you love. A portfolio of things that represent your passions, interests and dreams. That procrastinating these decisions into some sort of sequence of&nbsp;steps and chapters is crazy. There is little chance that one job will provide you all of the fulfillment of your life. But you will spend way too much time working, so how do we make it the best job, a job you care about, as the hub and build out great spokes from there. No one like us has to put up with a toxic job. Does that make sense?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb0897978c970d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Yin yang" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301bb0897978c970d img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb0897978c970d-500wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Yin yang"></a><br>Yeah, but I really thought you were just talking about a dream job, Leonard replied.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">No. A dream life. A lot of people struggle with so-called "work-life" balance. This is a myth and a harmful way of thinking. People seek balance because something in their lives is not as good as other parts. What if all parts were good? <strong>What if you designed your life to give you the fulfillment, flexibility, and the time to "balance" your life? Wouldn't that be a better life?&nbsp;</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Leonard nodded, "I know people(most people say they have a "friend";) who are really unhappy and they just can't leave their jobs."</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I hear a lot of people who want to blame everyone but themselves about the predicament they are in. Again, these are first world people with advanced degrees and great resumes. They have convinced themselves they are stuck--stuck like sea squirts.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sea squirts are odd slinky-like marine life that swim in schools to find a rock or piece of coral to make home. They permanently affix themselves to the rock. Then they do something really odd, they individually eat their own vertebrae and brains. Because when you are stuck on a rock you don't need a backbone or a&nbsp;mind!&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>I meet a lot of really smart sea squirts! No backbone to stand up for themselves and their lives. Who get&nbsp;shackled to a narrative of high consumption and higher expectations that makes them&nbsp;fall behind in their&nbsp;credit and their&nbsp;careers.&nbsp; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c7f3743b970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Sea squirts Bluebell" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b7c7f3743b970b img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c7f3743b970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Sea squirts Bluebell"></a></strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Just like moving from pensions and defined contribution retirement plans to 401K's , we have to run our own financial AND&nbsp;life portfolios.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is a materialistic and financial delusion that we need so much stuff. And that stuff puts us in debt and that starts the vicious cycle of compromises and postponed plans. We get burrowed and cemented into a rut that imprisons us. We want more and accept less.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">By the way, all setting a pattern of optimistic fatalism for our kids.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yet I watch a growing number&nbsp;of people emerge from the fog and break out of their cells&nbsp;of expectations by following their hearts.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Huge changes underway where people are making choices about priorities, downsized lifestyles, and upsized lives. Finding work they love.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the four pay cuts I took for jobs that gave me a more flexible life, I never regretted it.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I recently met a chef, who now has four restaurants. He was defense contractor engineer who was very well paid. He went to&nbsp;these gourmet dinners with wine pairings&nbsp;made&nbsp;by a friend. He loved these meals and quit his job to become a chef at 45. He would have made more money and had a bigger retirement fund, but he chose his heart over his financial&nbsp;plan.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>When you're doing something you love and are drawn to it, you want to do it all the time.&nbsp;</strong>- Ra Paulette&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Or the financial planner who volunteered for the Special Olympics and now is a neuropsychologist. Or the night club owner who decided to give his excess food to the homeless and now manages a social enterprise that does just that.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">People who have built happier and more meaningful&nbsp;lives around something that moved them. </span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>What moves you? What is important to you that isn't getting your attention? Build it into your portfolio. Design a life that makes space for it.</strong></span></p> 
          <p>&nbsp;<em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Be reckless when it comes to affairs of the heart.</span></em></p> 
          <p><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What I really mean … is be passionate, fall madly in love with life. Be passionate about some part of the natural and/or human worlds and take risks on its behalf, no matter how vulnerable they make you. No one ever died saying, “I’m sure glad for the self-centered, self-serving and self-protective life I lived.”</span></em></p> 
          <p><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Offer yourself to the world — your energies, your gifts, your visions, your heart — with open-hearted generosity. But understand that when you live that way you will soon learn how little you know and how easy it is to fail.</span></em></p> 
          <p><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Clinging to what you already know and do well is the path to an unlived life. So, cultivate beginner’s mind, walk straight into your not-knowing, and take the risk of failing and falling again and again, then getting up again and again to learn — that’s the path to a life lived large, in service of love, truth, and justice.&nbsp;</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Parker Palmer</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We have to wake up from the delusion that choice is a fantasy, clear the fog and take control!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Does this make sense Leonard? Now what?&nbsp;</span></p>

         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">No matter our circumstance we have challenging lives. Each one of us is trying to improve our life trajectory and the world around us. We all want to make a dent in the universe&nbsp;and see our way to&nbsp;find peace, joy and fulfillment.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">But our ability to see clearly is impaired by the&nbsp;<em>VUCA</em> world surrounding&nbsp;us. Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous. That contributes to&nbsp;our visual impairment. We scan many things but we see very little. Scientists say there are about 11 million inputs to our senses at any one time and we are lucky to decipher and sense 40 of them. <strong>What we see is what we get and shapes what we do.</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">My mother is an accomplished artist and I asked her for an "art lesson". I told her I wanted to learn how to paint. She was amused by&nbsp;my request. "Oh John you are so busy, you have such important things to do, (read with just the right touch of elegant sarcasm that cuts your heart out:) you don't have time for painting." She continued, "Many people think you need special DNA or inborn talent to paint, but it is not true. You simply need the ability to see. And John you don't have time to see." (Ouch!)</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">She finally relented and agreed to give me a lesson. She set up three apples in her studio. I had picked up a paint brush and found a small canvas. "What are you doing?!", she queried. "I am getting ready to paint". "Before we paint we have to see", she said with a wry smile.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <div class="photo-wrap photo-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b7c7e5f013970b" id="photo-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b7c7e5f013970b" style="float: right; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; width: 500px;">

            Morgan Russell's Three Apples inspired by Cezanne
           </div> 
          </div> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mom began to interrogate me about what I saw. (At least it felt like that) And while she talked I could hear my judgmental mind take over. "Why apples? I want to paint a seascape. These aren't even very nice looking apples....." I tried to re-focus. "Do you see the purple octogonal between the red and green apples? Can you see this shadow and the negative space here? Can you appreciate the geometry of what is here and not what you think is here?" This went on for a couple of hours. It was exhausting and frustrating. As the Buddhists say, "If you are bored you have not done it long enough."</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Then the apples started to come into view. I started to really see them.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>A time is coming when apples freshly observed will trigger a revolution.</strong> &nbsp;Apologies to Cezanne</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">My mother will never know the revolution she triggered in me!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hard to do anything if you can't see.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We are in such a rush. We put a premium on speed. But speed kills, our ability to see. We all have ADD.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Call it a lack of attention, mindfulness, or patience. We jump to conclusions. We judge and pre-judge. We want to cut to the chase because we lose interest in the plot. And we miss so much.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Not just in the world of things. But what we hear people say. What we notice about body language or facial expressions. How our food tastes. What feelings we are experiencing. And the people around us.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We are increasingly&nbsp;desensitized and numb and&nbsp;we see and feel less and less.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">And through this blur our brains change and evolve. Our judgmentalism puts us on neural pathways that skip any real thought or feeling.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We all operate this way and it under-girds our implicit biases (unconscious attitudes that impact what we see and do). These biases are not detectable through self awareness or introspection. They are embedded in our brains and may and often do, conflict with who we think we are.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Neuroscience is showing us that we tend to convert&nbsp;uncomfortable&nbsp;matters, especially those involving humans, into abstract thoughts. In Simon Sinek's wonderful book <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Leaders Eat Last</strong></span>,&nbsp;he asserts: <strong>"The more distance there is between us amplifies the abstraction and the harder it becomes to see each other as human."</strong> He goes on to describe that our "abundance" both in distraction and in need overwhelm our senses and "dehumanizes" our world.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In fact when people&nbsp;see photos of homeless people while in fMRI, our brains don't light up where it would for people we know or like. It fires up portions of our brains where inanimate objects reside--closer to furniture. Why? Because we can't invest the time, empathy, energy, in thinking about the needy so we create a mental short cut. Nameless and faceless people can be tidily put aside as things in our cranial hard drive.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">And our sense of&nbsp;humanity diminishes.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Tragedy of life is what dies within us while we live—the death of genuine feeling, the death of inspired response, the awareness that makes it possible to feel the pain or the glory of others.</strong> Norman Cousins&nbsp;<br></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So much easier to talk about homelessness than&nbsp;about the people living in tents down the street.&nbsp;When we avert our eyes, hearts and minds from those in need, we lose a little of ourselves.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mother Teresa said, "<strong>If we have no peace, it is because we forgot we belong to one another."</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">How do we keep our hyper space minds from building more neural pathways and our&nbsp;bulging implicit bias muscles? And restore our humanity.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Check our vision. Quiet our judgmental reflexes. Slow down a bit.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Put down the paint brushes and see what is in front of us. See each other. And connect to our altruistic selves.</span></p> 
          <p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">We are all connected and our destinies are tied to one another. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Can we see that?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">For me those unappealing apples triggered a revolution within me. What's your revolution?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thanks for reading. John</span></p>

         <h5 class="date-header font-dateheader"> <span class="entry-date"><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2015/10/momentary-mentoring-fragility-of-your-choices-.html">October 11, 2015</a></span> </h5> 
         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How did we end up where we are, right now? What were the thousand of unmemorable decisions, influences, strokes of luck (bad and good), right place right time circumstances that conspired for you to be right here. Some of you are smiling and others are not. We all have stories, do we not?! While our resumes and bios give certainty of credit and trajectory, we all know better. In fact we have forgotten most of the things that really contributed to our successes. Bits of advice, mentoring moments, what friends said or did, a death, a birth, a movie you saw, a speech you heard......hundreds of things that shaped your point of view and pushed and pulled you to where you are.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Are you noticing what is influencing, could be influencing you now? <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb08805557970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Emerson" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301bb08805557970d img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb08805557970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Emerson"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the last 72 hours I was reminded of the subtlety and fragility of those moments and messages. When I was younger I was "too focused" too ambitious" to see so much. I was lucky to have gained anything--and I did. I feel like I see and hear so much more today. Yeah, the clock is ticking but I am paying attention with a heart and mind that knows how much I don't know. That I still have unexplored talents and potential hidden within me.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">One of my favorite books is&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Instructions-Cook-Masters-Lessons-Matters/dp/1611800684" target="_blank">Instructions to the Cook&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">describes&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the Zen Buddhist&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">concept for the<em> supreme meal</em>. The&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">supreme meal is when we live our life&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">fully, wholeheartedly---a fully expressed life.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">So the first principle of the Zen cook is that we already have everything we need. If we look closely at our lives, we will find that we have all the ingredients we need to prepare the supreme meal. At every moment, we simply take the ingredients at hand and make the best meal we can. It doesn’t matter how much or how little we have. The Zen cook just looks at what is available and starts with that.</span></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 16px;">I lead a workshop for 74 newbies in the field of philanthropy. We all paused to reflect on the unpredictable circumstances that pushed us into philanthropy--a field none of us "majored in" or can explain to our parents! So is this a&nbsp;way-station&nbsp;to&nbsp;something else or is this the most important opportunity of our lifetime so far ?(choose #2). How do we make the most out of what we have and where we are?</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Visited the incredible <strong><a href="http://www.lacma.org/node/21616#landing" style="color: #0000bf; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Frank Gehry exhibition at</a><a href="http://www.lacma.org/node/21616#landing" style="color: #0000bf; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank"> LACMA</a>.&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: #111111;">The genius of Frank's architecture could have easily been lost to his stronger interest in becoming a pilot. His ceramics class unexpectedly led him to architecture. He ignored his professor who told him that architecture was not his field. And later after he designed a typical shopping center in Santa Monica, a mentor asked him if he was happy designing for others. Frank quit his cushy job and took a giant leap--and the rest is history. How do we respond to self-criticism and the judgment and discouragement of others? How do we do what we love?</span><span style="color: #111111; background-color: #888888;"><br></span></span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #111111;">Saw <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Named_Me_Malala" style="color: #0000bf;" target="_blank">He named me Malala</a></span></strong>&nbsp;</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: #111111;">film where a 14 year old girl literally gets shot in the face with her destiny and becomes the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Her unique parents, her name, her incredible personality, the influences of the needs around her and the Taliban forged her destiny. How do we uphold our values and the rights of others? How do we react to tragedy, pain and threats?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000bf;"><br></span></span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: #111111;">And then to top it off I saw <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lost Angels</strong></span>, a gritty documentary about the fates of <em>regular</em> people who end up on skid row. Poignant stories of choices, challenges, misfortune, and the ovarian lottery. How do we manage our balance, sanity, finances, addictions, and demons to stay on the straight and narrow?&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>How do we make the most out of what we have?</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvG_UlvqggA" width="560"></iframe>&nbsp;</strong></span></li> 
          </ul> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Stuff happens. Switches get flipped. New paths appear. People push, others pull. You get bored, inspired, discouraged and educated. Outside forces influence your little asteroid into a different orbit and trajectory--if you let them. What chances and changes do we prevent from happening? What do we suppress, fail to express, and under-value in our pursuit of the practical and prudent? <strong>What is right in front of you right now that you can't see because your lenses are zoomed in on what is more important to others than to you?&nbsp;</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">All of the ingredients are in your cupboard to make the supreme meal. What do you have that you have forgotten about? What do you have that you have never tasted or used? How do you focus on where you are and what you are doing to make it supreme?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Every moment is fleeting, fragile and filled with opportunity. The emergence of your passions and purpose grow within you. Meaning and fulfillment are not foreign destinations you hope to visit some day, they surround you. You have what it takes. The possibilities within you are untapped. The opportunities around you are boundless.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I want to incorporate the flavors of the newbie beginner's mind, the outside perspective of Gehry, &nbsp;Malala's courage, and the humility of the homeless into my cuisine.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What do you want?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Put on your apron, open your cupboard, sharpen your knives---let's get cooking!!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thanks for reading. John</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>It's a real wrenching thing to go from being a private person to being a public person. But it's what everyone wants - to get everyone's attention, to have your music make a living for you, to be validated in that way.</strong> </span>--James Taylor</p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">My Dad Roderick Yoshimi Kobara lived a full and fulfilling life. He died peacefully just before his 90 birthday. &nbsp;His life was a version of the American dream. He grew up in poverty outside of Salinas California. His father, my grandfather, died before he was 50 and only had one good profitable year as a farmer. I never met my grandfather, he was a hard living and hard drinking man of few words. From the little bits I have pieced together it was a brutal life. Dad decided to go to college and forge his own path. His entire family was interned in the concentration camps in Poston Arizona in WWII and lost everything. Nevertheless, he enlisted in the army to serve his country. He emerged out of the camps with a hunger to prove he was an American. He legally added Roderick to his name to become more accepted in the mainstream culture. He got admitted into the University of San Francisco and got straight As his first year. He knew he was not that smart so transferred to UC Berkeley to be challenged. He wanted to be a medical doctor, but his inferior camp education set him back and he pursued business and ultimately accounting. He faced enormous discrimination on campus and after he graduated from Berkeley to pursue a career in accounting. Finally a Jewish accountant in Stockton hired him as an apprentice. He passed his CPA exams and became one of the first Japanese-American CPAs in California. He opened his practice just outside of J-town in San Jose, where he built and operated his firm for more than 50 years. He was a self-made man who valued his heritage, education, hard work, and service to community and family</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Despite his success he saw his own potential to do more.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c7d17df3970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Dad" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b7c7d17df3970b img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c7d17df3970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Dad"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">He had high expectations of his children. He desperately wanted his kids to become successful and named them John, Mitchell, Katherine and Elizabeth. Assimilation and fitting in was an essential value. He was a man of few words, not unlike other Nisei men (second generation Japanese-Americans). Hugs and the words “I love you” came decades later when he was a grandparent. Yet he provided for his kids to have every opportunity he did not.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We all want to please our Dads. I was no different.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">More than any other person my Dad is responsible for my development as an evangelist for networking and mentoring.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the early 60’s my parents would have friends over to play bridge or to socialize. He told us many times to come down from our rooms and to shake the hands of his friends and introduce ourselves. We rarely did. It was an exhausting loop of unmet expectations that irritated and I think embarrassed our father. One night, he called Mitch and me into the kitchen for yet another lecture on self-introductions. We were oblivious and disinterested teenagers and this pissed him off. He talked for a few minutes about what it takes to be successful in America. That meeting people, shaking hands, speaking well and becoming a “public person” were critical skills. He talked of his own struggles and wanted us to have an advantage. (I am giving him some eloquence here) A speech he never gave again. We looked lost. So he grabs me by the shirt, just to get my undivided attention while Mitch braced himself for something worse. He says, <strong>“If you do not become a <em>public person</em>, I am sending you to a psychiatrist!”</strong> More confusion washed over our faces. He left us exasperated and angry.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I never forgot that night and those words. I tried to give speeches in high school; I joined the band and student council. But I was so uncomfortable with myself. In college I continued to push myself to fit in and to become a better speaker&nbsp;and meeting others. But they remained elusive skills. I was introverted and an inauthentic speaker. I sought advice and eventually took public speaking classes. In graduate school, the idea of a <em>public person</em> returned to me and I continued on a winding uphill path of developing my <em>public person</em> skills.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">After decades of trying to interpret my Dad’s goal for us, I found my own way. Years ago I invited him to hear me lead a workshop, where I told this story. I introduced him to the class and asked him if the “public person and psychiatrist” part was true—he nodded affirmatively. Then he said, “See and you turned out pretty good!” High praise from my father. But I also saw a flash of parental satisfaction as we both enjoyed a moment from the sculpted versions of our histories.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Today, my goal of being a <em>public person</em> has evolved. <strong>How do we reveal&nbsp;our true selves? How do we see as much as be seen? How do we help others without expectation? How do we engage others to pursue our common pursuit of meaning and fulfillment? How do we become part of something much larger than ourselves?</strong></span></p> 
          <p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How do we become and how do we help others become a <em>public person?</em></span></strong></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bottomline: He mentored me and introduced me to networking. He planted a seed within me that I made my own. He inspired SWiVEL.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Although many think I need a psychiatrist, my Dad’s antidote has worked so far. :)</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thanks Dad for your sacrifices, for giving me so many opportunities, for teaching me how to play golf, for loving me in your own way and encouraging me to&nbsp;“smell the roses”. Thanks for giving me the challenge and satisfaction of trying to become a public person. Your life and your advice will continue to inspire me.</span></p>

         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything. George Bernard Shaw</span></h3> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some people discuss "change" like it is a monster. A source of stress and distress. "Change" is a darkening cloud that will bring great tragedy and pain.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Or a savior for necessary evolution.&nbsp;And the light on the path of purpose.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Those who embrace the change are empowered by the change. Yeah, it has to do with risk and self-esteem. If you are defined by your job or your title or your retirement plan then the bogeyman of change is Godzilla.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">But if you exist to serve, adapt and pursue your passions, then change becomes your sidekick.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">None of us wants the status quo. Right? The status quo sucks. For people suffering. For our careers. For our families. For our communities. Putting our worlds on freeze-frame would imprison everyone to now. Now John, you are misinterpreting me! So tell me oh misinterpreted one, What do you want? Tell me! You want change on your terms, on your schedule, Zeus?!! You want convenient change in the economy size to fit into your carry-on luggage?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Change is the air we breathe and the ground we traverse. Change is life. Life is change. We never step in the same river twice, we never have the same conversation or see the same film the same way. We evolve and the world around us evolves and we both try and catch up. Once you understand change is the water from <span style="color: #0060bf;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0060bf;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David Foster Wallace's epic commencement address</span></strong></span></a></span>.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Change is just happening, it is relentless. Not even talking about the shifting sands of the world around us that we are partially or totally ignorant of. The butterfly wings that are shaping El Nino or the currency wars that are impacting our retirement plans........</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Yes earthshaking change gets our attention at least for a few moments. You get laid off. Someone becomes terminally ill. You become a grandfather. You have a break-up. You get a new boss. The famous study of recent paraplegics and lottery winners showed that a &nbsp;year after their life defining events, both groups had the same levels of happiness! We get over the big changes.&nbsp; And we miss the subtle and important ones. <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c7c3d401970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Mind the change" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b7c7c3d401970b img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c7c3d401970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Mind the change"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Change is&nbsp;how we react to it--if we react at all.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">One of our favorite past times is participating in the unnecessary stress inducing game of hating change.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The future is already here it s just not evenly distributed.</strong> William Gibson</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You hoped things would "stabilize" or "stay the same" for a little while so you could catch your breath? Hah!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Change is neither an enemy or a friend. It is.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Change is subtle and like the glaciers or the coral reefs, big changes occur over long horizons. But if we don't notice them its too late.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our brains are changing and capable of change. Not just memory loss! If we literally put our minds to it. :)</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Luddite who will not upgrade their flip phone. The smoker who thinks they are the exception. The parent who raises their kids like they were. The manager who does not listen to his staff. The perfectionist who never makes a mistake.......</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Time stands still---in their minds. And the world evolves without them.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The crazy thing is YOU are changing and evolving. And could change even more if you let yourself.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Like the lizard or snake that molts and sheds their entire skin we are evolving more invisibly. (the average human sheds about 1mm skin cells a day!)</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here is the big deal. Everything you do, people you encounter, visuals you ingest, thoughts that you entertain, are making micro and macro changes to you--if you let them.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Are you aware of these changes?&nbsp;Good question!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Are we allowing the changes to change you? Better question!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Do we appreciate the changes that are changing you? Right question!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Is your disagreement with my words changing you a little?&nbsp;:)</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is not a solo exercise. It is the process of engagement with others. Change is accelerated in a social network, a trusting group of diverse truth tellers who provide and receive honest feedback and different perspectives.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Networking and mentoring done with altruism, an open heart and mind, fuel change possibilities.&nbsp;Help your colleagues and friends and relatives see and embrace their change.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The tyranny of certainty is the real enemy. We develop "truths" about what we don't know. This can range from&nbsp;naivete&nbsp;to ignorance to racism. Certainty prevents us from learning.</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You are a whirling dervish of velcro picking up little pieces of change along the way. But if you whirl&nbsp;on the same beaten known paths then change is relative for you. If you whirl off the known roads of life and explore the world then you change and challenge your certainties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We must break down the gates of certainty to get to the gardens of change.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>All that you touch</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>You Change.</strong></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>All that you Change</strong></span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Changes You.</strong></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The only lasting truth</strong></span><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>is Change.</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Octavia Butler</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Change is neither friend or foe. It is a frame of mind. Mind the change and change&nbsp;your mind.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be the change you wish to see in the world.&nbsp;</span> I humbly offer a version of this timeless quote from Gandhi.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Let us be changed by the world we see.</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thanks for reading. John</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You know when you are thinking about something, then you seem surrounded by that idea. It appears everywhere. That's what is happening with me and the concept of altruism. It is emerging, at least in my worldview, as a trending solution for what ails us. I mean everything that ails us. I know, hang onto your hats and let me finish! :) We all know that in our hearts that caring for one another, unconditionally, is not only right but essential if we are to thrive. We all want to foster a sense of community with others. As Jeremy Rifkin says, <strong>a meaningful life comes from belonging not belongings!</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">No one we know is not empathetic or not compassionate--at least that is what we tell each other!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I had the extraordinary opportunity to meet and interview <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthieu_Ricard" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000bf;"><strong>Matthieu Ricard</strong></span></a></span>, the respected scientist and Buddhist monk. His latest book <span style="color: #0000bf;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Altruism-Power-Compassion-Change-Yourself/dp/0316208248" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><strong>Altruism</strong></span></a></span>, asserts that social change needs to start with each one of us. That if we each invoke the power of love and genuine care for one another we will change ourselves and the world around us.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;To do this, we must cultivate altruism on an individual level, for that is where everything begins. Altruism shows us what is good to do, but also how one should be, and what qualities and virtues one should cultivate. Starting with a kindly motivation, altruism should be integrated into our everyday lives, and should reflect the unique quality of every being and every situation. We should promote altruism on the level of society through education, through institutions that respect the rights of every individual, and through political and economic systems that allow everyone to flourish without sacrificing the good of future generations.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Altruism is not just being good and doing nice things from time to time. It is a state of mind that grows and develops and is only strong when our self-centered individuality is secondary. You cannot be truly altruisitic if you are thinking about WIIFM (What’s in it for me)</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Prior to meeting Ricard I confused the concepts of empathy, compassion and altruism. Ricard set me straight. While we need all of these perspectives and insights, we really need to adopt an altruistic lifestyle. An action oriented lifestyle of helping others without expectation.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Empathy is an act of humanity where we connect and relate with another. Empathy can lead to compassion and altruism but it can easily lead to distress, burnout and avoidance of action. Empathetic distress caused by the overwhelming dimensions of suffering can make us view suffering: abstractly, as disembodied needs, as nameless and faceless non-human objects and therefore not real. Ironically, empathy can push us towards greater isolation and selfishness. We do this to protect ourselves. And that leads to more concern for self—the enemy of compassion.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In fact new research from Paul Bloom and Richard Davidson contends that empathy alone can lead to less compassion. <strong>“The more empathy you have, the more violent you are—the more ready and willing you are to cause pain."</strong>&nbsp;This research shows that empathy for victims can create hate and anger</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Reading <strong>Altruism</strong> and my time with Ricard shifted my views and assumptions in many ways. This is a book of philosophy and great stories. But this is also an in-depth book of scientific proof. Only a scientist Buddhist monk could write this. Here's what I learned:</span></p> 
          <ul type="disc"> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Empathy is a vital human lens through which we examine ourselves and others. We need to feel for others and resonate with their circumstances. But empathy <em>can</em> be a step toward compassion and altruism. It is inadequate and even dangerous if it does not evolve into compassion and altruism. Change and action are not assured by feeling for others. So empathy can easily lead to isolation, burnout and empathetic distress.&nbsp;</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Compassion is the ability to see everyone as equals and worthy of our care, love and unconditional support. That we are all interconnected to each other. That our fates are tied together. And compassion alone is also inadequate without action.</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Altruism is the unconditional assistance of "others". Altruism is relieving suffering without expectation. True altruism is not driven by an “ROI”, reciprocity, a quid pro quo, and/or personal gain.</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Altruism is the antidote to empathetic burnout or fatigue. Helping others unconditionally—people we know or don’t know, feed our sense of purpose and gives us a physical and measurable neural lift. Altruism offsets the burden of need and the weight of guilt, and the stress from being unresponsive.</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mindfulness meditation are good if you want to rest and empty your mind. But what do we do with an empty mind before it gets re-filled with the congestion of life? Mindfulness and meditation have to have a purpose, a focus. Meditation focused on compassion fills your mind and shifts your brain toward positive action and behavior. As Matthieu warned us, a great sniper needs to be mindful. He needs to be present, breathe calmly, and reach a state of serenity before he kills people.</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Purposeful meditation can change your mind and lead to physical as well as spiritual growth. At any age and at any stage, you can learn altruism and meditation is the path.</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We have to see ourselves less as individuals and more interconnected to fates and destinies of all people and living things, including our environment and planet. Individualism is great for talent and competitiveness, but it undermines our compassion and altruism. <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb0858708d970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Ricard 2" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301bb0858708d970d img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb0858708d970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Ricard 2"></a></span></li> 
          </ul> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What I learned from Ricard is we have to add intentions, purpose, and then action to our feelings. We deceive ourselves that sympathy, empathy, compassion make us altruistic. In the end altruism is about action. Yes we should feel for others and resonate with their suffering (empathy and sympathy). Yes, we should want to alleviate the suffering (compassion). But without action these are selfish, self-medicating, self-absorbing thoughts that fall short of altruism.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hate, ignorance, anger, indifference, neglect, are heavy burdens we suffer that dissipate when you are altruistic and express compassionate love. We relieve our own suffering through acts of altruism.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ricard discussed the amazing work he is doing with school children, about 100,000 involved in compassionate meditation. It is having fantastic results. Calming our kids to focus on themselves and others. One of the stories he shared involved elementary school students, referred to as the “stickers test.”</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On two occasions, at they gave each of the students a certain number of stickers they adore so much, along with four envelopes containing respectively a photo of their best friend, their least favorite child, an unknown child, and a visibly ill child wearing a bandage on his forehead. They asked each child to distribute the stickers in the four envelopes. They gave almost all of their stickers to their best friend, and very few to the others. After ten weeks of meditation and practicing benevolence, the students were asked to distribute the stickers in the same envelopes. &nbsp;The students gave an almost equal number of stickers to the four groups of children: they no longer made any distinction between their favorite classmate and the one they liked least.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It has changed the way I talk and teach mentoring and networking. Mentoring and networking can be selfish pursuits of manipulation and self-serving activities without compassion and alrtruism. While I have been trying to counter self-centeredness with interconnectedness, I realize that I never explicitly embedded positive care, love and authentic regard for one another in my teachings. I assumed it was there. That was wrong.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We are not that far from becoming truly altruistic. But it requires us to train, learn and continue to evolve. Ricard really gave me new thoughts that help me understand my own shortcomings and growth opportunities.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Empathy is not enough. Mindfulness is insufficient. Inaction and apathy are self-destructive. We have to become more connected, compassionate and altruistic if we want to save the world and ourselves.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thanks for reading. John</span></p>

         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Is this all there is?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Is this the life I was meant to lead?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What difference am I making/will I make?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Questions that we all ask and must address. The answers define perspective and our path. The answers define what we do and the choices we make. The answers shape our future.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Joseph Campbell: <strong>We must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that is waiting for us.</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We can only respond to what is calling us. To what the world reveals to us. To the opportunities that engage our hearts and minds. To the intuition of what we were meant to do.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">But what beckons us, pushes us, pulls us, mesmerizes us is a function of our perspective and our willingness to experience these forces. <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb084a37fa970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Stumbling" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301bb084a37fa970d img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb084a37fa970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Stumbling"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I met two people this week.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">An executive who was at a new beginning of her journey of defining her purpose. 20 years into her career of successful and progressive promotions in the same industry. She was successful in all of the external measures of title, money, and prestige. She is 47. &nbsp;But she realized she had submerged her desires, interests, and passions to the expectations of others. How to please her parents, her mentors, her bosses and her peers. Everyone but herself. She was awakening to her inner voices trapped beneath the rubble of other people’s expectations. She wanted to rescue herself before it was too late. I did little in this conversation but allowed her to speak and express herself. It was powerful to see and witness. It was like the child of possibilities was reborn. She saw that she had a new world of opportunities ahead of her. My only advice was to fully explore her interests and to listen to what her heart was telling her. She was fearful and excited.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mark Twain: <strong>The two most important days are the day you were born and the day you find out why.</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Then I met a young man who was the child of drug addicts and was essentially abandoned to a gang. He was angry. The gang became his surrogate family and they cared for his needs-emotional and financial. They gave him a future. They mentored him. He became a father at 13 and then again at 17. He too was awakening. He had surrendered his future to others too. His dreams were left behind. So now he is getting his life together, thanks to a community based youth mentoring program. He is 19. He is hopeful. He was asked, “What advice would you give other young men that are in the situation you were in? He said without hesitation, “Find your purpose. We all have a purpose. We have to find it.” Wisdom comes from unexpected sources.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When will we pursue our purpose? When our hearts speak to us do we listen and take note?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Through the haze of life there are moments of clarity. Moments where we say, "Oh there it is again." That feeling of satisfaction of purposeful activity that aligns with our moral and spiritual compass. Not something that impresses others. Something that impresses you. Not an achievement but an activity or even a persistent idea that aligns with our soul. It may be fleeting. It may be a continuous flow, if you are lucky. A flow of engagement of who you are but almost always about the needs of others. As in love and even answers about our destinies, we have moments of deep clarity that propel us forward. A story strikes us, a Tedtalk, a news item, a childhood memory……We get distracted. We always want more or something else. We need to trust ourselves.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We say we like challenges but we also avoid the challenging work we want to do, we need to do to define our lives. We fill our time with the mindless and defer the mindful. The couch beckons and our courage wanes. The only thing that makes progress is time.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Suddenly I am behind on my bills and my dreams.</strong> Les Brown</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We plot our lives like a clever chess player thinking 3-5 moves ahead. And we can miss the detours, new opportunities, and unbeknownst options that are right in front of us.&nbsp;<strong>The next can be the enemy of the now.</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We must suffer, struggle and stumble to give our life the meaning and purpose we crave. Meaning and purpose do not knock on your door or fall into your lap. They visit those who have compassion for themselves and others. Those engaged in the great fight for purpose.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I love this excerpt from <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><strong><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/2015/04/21/david-brooks-the-road-to-character/" target="_self"><span style="color: #0000bf; text-decoration: underline;">David Brooks </span></a></strong></span>&nbsp;-----------</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Commencement speakers are always telling young people to follow their passions. Be true to yourself. This is a vision of life that begins with self and ends with self. But people on the road to inner light do not find their vocations by asking, what do I want from life? They ask, what is life asking of me?</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Their lives often follow a pattern of defeat, recognition, redemption. They have moments of pain and suffering. But they turn those moments into occasions of radical self-understanding — by keeping a journal or making art. As Paul Tillich put it,&nbsp;<strong>suffering introduces you to yourself and reminds you that you are not the person you thought you were</strong>.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>The people on this road see the moments of suffering as pieces of a larger narrative. They are not really living for happiness, as it is conventionally defined. They see life as a moral drama and feel fulfilled only when they are enmeshed in a struggle on behalf of some ideal.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>This is a philosophy for stumblers. The stumbler scuffs through life, a little off balance. But the stumbler faces her imperfect nature with unvarnished honesty, with the opposite of squeamishness. The stumbler has an outstretched arm, ready to receive and offer assistance. </em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>External ambitions are never satisfied because there’s always something more to achieve. There’s an aesthetic joy we feel when we see morally good action, when we run across someone who is quiet and humble and good, when we see that however old we are, there’s lots to do ahead.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>The stumbler doesn’t build her life by being better than others, but by being better than she used to be. </em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Those are the people we want to be.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We have to suffer and struggle if we want a life of meaning that is much bigger than ourselves. We have to connect with ourselves, with our purpose and stumble forward, always forward.&nbsp;</span></p>

          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Sometimes you have to travel far away to understand oneself. We need the perspective, the less cluttered and noisy view of ourselves to see ourselves. Part of it is the true value of comparative evaluation. You know, sizing up what you have or want against others. There is one thing to see someone confined to a wheelchair, which is so different than imagining you are in that chair! Making that little switch triggers a different level of empathy and insight. In the end, how we view what we have, what has been given to us, the so-called hand we are dealt, and make the most out of it? Even the bad stuff. (Say more John I don't know what you mean) Trying to avoid the hackneyed lemonade bromide. Ooops there it is :)&nbsp; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d115123c970c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Myanmar Schwe Dagon" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b8d115123c970c img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d115123c970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Myanmar Schwe Dagon"></a></p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">I had the great fortune to visit the emerging third world democracy of Myanmar recently. (second most isolated country behind N Korea just a few years ago) One of the most beautiful and brutal places I have ever seen. Immersed in these stark contrasts from my life in Los Angeles, I was pulled into a different mindset. I think the overwhelming vistas of sacred edifices, wrapped in punishing poverty and surrounded by the grace of a welcoming people opened my mind. I know all of these elements exist everywhere, if I saw them, but parachuting into a new environment flips a perspective switch. At first I resisted these forces of self examination to stay on task with my trip. But I quickly surrendered to these flowing thoughts and tried to allow them to take me on a parallel journey.</p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">I know that my first world guilt and privilege were drivers here. But I also know that the mind craves the space for thought and reflection. The incredible fusion of this mindset with the inputs from our trek through the Burmese landscape made this trip memorable and meaningful.</p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Way too much to say here but want to share several images and ideas that continue to energize me.</p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><strong> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb082f78ec970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Myanmar smiles" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301bb082f78ec970d img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb082f78ec970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Myanmar smiles"></a>The Myanmar smile</strong>: Everyone in Myanmar. I mean every single person we encountered was friendly, warm, and open to us. There was a avalanche of authenticity. People saying "minglabar" (hello/welcome in Burmese) with true sincerity. I know this sounds naive, and I know that perhaps some of the people were disingenuous. But I felt I was in their presence. It was hard work to try and reciprocate. Part of my detox from the world of being on guard, of the hard bubble of personal space and the root of distrusting others until proven innocent. In my mind, I try to be open to others, but my struggles to receive and return the emotional and spiritual generosity from Myanmar revealed my true potential.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">In a meditation session I attended in Myanmar, our leader asked us to sense everything about our bodies--but he cautioned "don't react to anything you sense, observe yourself from the outside--let the monkeys play!" Let the monkeys play. Let things happen and see them without judgment. Quiet the mind and let the monkeys play.....&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">How can I be more trusting, more welcoming, more open to others? How can I initiate this trust this warmth and this openness?&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><strong> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb082f7947970d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Lotus" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301bb082f7947970d img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb082f7947970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Lotus"></a>The Lotus Flower</strong>: I have always been drawn to the lotus flower. The beautiful bloom atop a glassy body of water. But like most things I knew nothing more about the lotus.</p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">We spent many days on waterways, rivers and lakes and I was re-introduced to the lotus flower. Our guide Czarina made a comment that changed my view of this plant. She said, <strong>"The lotus &nbsp;draws its strength from the dirtiest water, transforming it into a beautiful flower."</strong> (these waters were some of the most polluted I have ever seen) What an amazing metaphor for life. How do we convert the pools of negativity that surround our lives into beautiful blossoms by tapping into our inner reservoir of spirit and talent?&nbsp;We all sit in our own pools of impurities--self-made, God-given, environmental--and how do we we convert our circumstances into a thing of beauty? How do we truly embrace "our dirt" own it but also appreciate it to move us forward? For without our dirt we would not understand what we want. Without the dirt we would not have to struggle and suffer. And without suffering we can not live a meaningful life.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">I googled the lotus flower and learned that the lotus flower is associated with purity and beauty in Buddhism and Hinduism. The ancient Egyptians scholars observed that in the night-time the lotus closed its flowers and sank into the water, and was reborn the next day. In actual fact the lotus slowly emerges from a pond and then blooms in the morning until mid-afternoon. And the lotus does thrive in murky/dirty waters.</p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">The lotus emerges from the pollution to be faithful to its beauty and purpose. To open to the sun gracing the world, &nbsp;like a humble brag, &nbsp;"Here's what I do!"</p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><strong>All that you touch you change. All that you change changes you.</strong> Octavia Butler</p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">A smile, your smile. A lotus flower, your lotus flower. How do we take our great capacity to love one another and share it? How can we be more open to being changed? How do we let the monkeys play? How do we fully embrace our dirt to display our beauty?&nbsp;</p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Minglabar!</p> 
          <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Thanks for reading. John</p>

         <h5 class="date-header font-dateheader"> <span class="entry-date"><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2015/04/what-is-your-story-understanding-your-narrative-and-where-it-is-taking-you.html">April 04, 2015</a></span> </h5> 
         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I have found that people do not appreciate their own stories. There is such a premium placed on amazing, dramatic, tear-jerkers that <em>average</em> stories, just stories about who we are and what we want are relegated to the "boring" file. So these stories are neglected and unformed. Yet I have found that every personal story told is fascinating.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Our stories are helpful to others so they can help us. But our stories can reinforce our own behaviors and actions and become self fulfilling prophecies. <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb08166c00970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Greatest-story1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301bb08166c00970d img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb08166c00970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Greatest-story1"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Not talking about your interview technique or even how to sound clever at a cocktail party.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I am talking about what you say to yourself and how that reveals itself to others.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The classics: "I am not good at math." "I have a terrible voice." "I can't even draw a circle." "I can't even boil water." "I am such a terrible public speaker."</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Whether you like it or not these are part of your story and become part of your reputation.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What are you good at? What are you most confident about? Are you risk averse? Are you afraid of failure or looking stupid?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">You can become what you say you are and not become what you don't say.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What are you telling yourself about you?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I made a woman and a young man cry recently.&nbsp;I didn't mean to.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It was my interpretation of their stories that got them choked up.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The gentleman was testing his pitch for a new venture he was thinking of starting and I told him that people want to invest in you who are you. I gave him my version of the hardships he had overcome.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The lady was looking to make a very serious career change and I asked her to tell me why? She struggled with her answer. I summarized her rationale, qualifications and the value she would add.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I loved their stories. Basically I told them their own stories. I gleaned from them what they were saying and I crafted the stories--positive stories. I have no special skill or technique. I listened to them and read their resumes. These were uplifting meetings for all of us. To see people's potential and share it with them was inspirational for me! When your story is set free and it resonates with the protagonist it creates vulnerability--like a secret was told out loud. It is liberating. It can be cathartic. It is empowering.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">And your story evolves, if you allow it. If you keep an eye on the possibility ahead you can edit your story.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">One of the many benefits of mentoring and networking is to work on your internal narrative. What story is guiding how you live and what you do. The greatest gift is to ask someone you trust: "What do you see in me?" 'Where do you see me going?"&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Steve Jobs advice from his famous commencement address still rings true. <strong>"<em>Don’t let the noise of other’s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly already want to become. Everything else is secondary."</em></strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Hearing your inner voice out loud gives it life and freedom far from the tyranny of others expectations.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Is your story fraught with limitations, excuses and pessimism? Or is it nestled in optimism, opportunities, and lessons?&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">"I have few options." "I don't have the right (education, job, mentor, financial condition....)"&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Or</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">"There are so many things I can do and learn." "This problem is going to teach me new things."&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It is a choice. The story you tell.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Stories we tell ourselves and others define our well-being. Depressed individuals often have deeply ingrained internal stories such as ‘I’m never good enough,’ or ‘My father told me I should have been a doctor.’ &nbsp;Versus athletes who visualize success and use mantras like "You have been here before. You know what to do."</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">From Phillipa Perry's book&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008RLTZRS/ref=rdr_kindle_ext_tmb" target="_blank">How to Stay Sane</a></strong>&nbsp;<strong>"The meanings you find, and the stories you hear, will have an impact on how optimistic you are: it’s how we evolved. If you do not know how to draw positive meaning from what happens in life, the neural pathways you need to appreciate good news will never fire up.&nbsp;We need to look at the repetitions in the stories we tell ourselves, at the&nbsp;<em>process</em>&nbsp;of the stories rather than merely their surface content. Then we can begin to experiment with changing the filter through which we look at the world, start to edit the story and thus regain flexibility where we have been getting stuck."</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Take control of your story. Own it. Interrupt the negative audio loops. Open it up. Tell your truths. Talk about it. Listen to other people's assessments of it. Edit and enhance your story. See the possibilities over the problems. Your story is amazing. Sometimes you just have to get out of its way.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Thanks for reading. John</span></p>

         <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader"> <span class="entry-title"> <a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2015/03/your-fit-ness.html">Career FITness: FIT or Finished</a> </span> </h2> 
         <h5 class="date-header font-dateheader"> <span class="entry-date"><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2015/03/your-fit-ness.html">March 12, 2015</a></span> </h5> 
         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Like a finely made car, brand new and just out of the factory, there is as they say, <strong><em>fit and finish</em></strong>. It is shiny, everything works well, there are no rattles or dings. But we know when we drive off the lot, the car loses value and it starts its inevitable decline into planned obsolescence. Both its FITness and Finish are victims of time, without a maintenance program.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Your FITness in your life is crucial. Do you still FIT into your professional life? Are you at the right place at this time in your life? <strong>Do you like what you do and does your work like you?</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Hiring today is more about FIT than anything else. There are still a lot of very qualified competent people with impressive resumes out there. But can they FIT into the culture and get along with the team? Do they FIT?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">But many people forget that FITness is ongoing. After the offer letter, retention, growth and success at your employer depends on your evolving and adapting FITness.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>What got you here, is not what will get you there.</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">FITness is a two-sided deal. Your employer is always evaluating your talent. Either you are growing and adapting or you are not. But the key to FITness is your evaluation. Your assessment of whether you FIT, whether the current place you spend most of your waking hours is still the right FIT.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Do I FIT? Is there a FIT?&nbsp; So what is my FITness?</span></p> 
          <div class="photo-wrap photo-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b8d0ea26a7970c" id="photo-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b8d0ea26a7970c" style="float: right; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; width: 300px;">

            Michelangelo’s sculpture The Captive Slave , seemingly half- finished, shows a figure attempting to escape from the stone. Or is about the struggle for freedom in everyday life?

          </div> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We can get complacent until something happens. Usually something bad, really bad.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We fall out of FITness like America became obese. When we woke up we were out of shape with our lives. We get stuck in a comfortable cycle that we know is not good for us. We are bloated with apathy and have little energy for change—even though we know FITness is what we need and even crave. We wonder how we got to this point. It just happened.</span></p> 
          <p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I don’t FIT into my jeans or my life :)</span></strong></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">As a close friend of mine was told by his spouse, <strong>“I guess your job needs you more than you do.”</strong> That was a 7.0 on the Richter Scale. He left the job when he realized what others saw for years.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">My wife told me, after I left one of my 19 positions. “Never do that to us again!” She told me how brutal it was for her and the kids. I was blown away and clueless. I knew it was a bad FIT but I didn’t know how obvious it was. My poor FITness unintentionally hurt my family life too.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">On the other side, when you FIT you know it. You feel engaged and you engage people around you. You are leading your life. You don’t talk about how <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><strong><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2014/09/you-busy-the-b-word-1.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000bf; text-decoration: underline;">busy </span></a></strong></span>you are or how stressed you are (signs of you are not FIT). Instead you have a sense of contribution to the work of a team and a greater purpose. It shows on your face and others see it clearly.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Are you willing to do what it takes to get FIT where you are?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Are you engaged in helping your colleagues and your boss succeed?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Have you negotiated and pushed for what you want?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Have you explored the ways you can develop your skills knowledge and abilities?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">More often I talk people off ledges. People who have developed almost self destructive relationships with their jobs. A Stockholm Syndrome like dependency. They are trying to tough out a situation that is clearly wrong for them. I never say, JUMP! I want them to see it—to define the lack of FITness.</span></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">“I have just 8 years to get my retirement (8 years! You could get two bachelor degrees!)</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">“I really like the people I work with, I just hate the work.”</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">“I can’t quit this job now, how would it look on my resume?”</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">“I am ready to be promoted, I like where I work even though there is no place for me to move up.”</span></li> 
          </ul> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">These are the sounds of people on the River Denial. They hope something will happen. Lightning will strike. Things might get better down the road—after the new VP settles in, or the new product line is launched, or after my vacation……. Waiting is never a strategy. Even if they want to leave they have to invest in a smooth transition.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">But bad examples should never motivate. That’s too easy. Here’s the deal. You have limited time to do what you want and pursue what’s in your heart. To have a life that is fulfilling. To find FITness. And then you die. Sorry.</span></p> 
          <p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The people who find FITness have a growing understanding of what they want. They have clearer goals about money and material things. They know MORE is not a path to FITness. Purpose is the way to FITness.</span></strong></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">They find FITness where they are. They add to their life portfolios to become FIT. They invest in their relationships and their passions. They start to lead themselves and others by setting an example of what they want.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">So pull up your big boy and big girl pants and start to take control of your FITness.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Start by articulating what you want. Not by whining about what you don’t want.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Take a swing for the fences of fulfillment. Not telling you to quit, but pack your parachute well. Make plans. Moonlight. Experiment. Talk to people. Explore your network.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This sense of direction and purpose (even if you are not exactly sure where you are going) will give you confidence and inspire confidence around you. Opportunities seek and find such people.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">How’s your FITness? Do you FIT? Are you FIT or finished?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Thanks for reading. John</span></p>

         <h5 class="date-header font-dateheader"> <span class="entry-date"><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2015/02/network-of-vulnerability.html">February 18, 2015</a></span> </h5> 
         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Probably my age and stage in life but I am getting more sensitive (that's very funny John). No seriously I cry at TV ads and even the mention of tear jerking stories. I am sure I am going through some type of hormonal change (no jokes please). But I know I am much more aware of the preciousness and speed of life and my awareness about the world around me has been heightened. I see, hear, feel, and understand more--at least I think so.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Vulnerability is a word I encounter and use more often. It applies to so much of what I do and what I am thinking about.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>vul·ner·a·ble&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ˈvəln(ə)rəb(ə)l/</span><br><span style="font-size: 11pt;">adjective</span><br><span style="font-size: 11pt;">susceptible to physical or emotional harm.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 11pt;">synonyms: helpless, defenseless, powerless, impotent, weak, susceptible</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 11pt;">person(s) in need of special care, support, or protection because of age, disability, or risk of abuse or neglect. <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb07f30cc4970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Broken heart" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301bb07f30cc4970d img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301bb07f30cc4970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Broken heart"></a></span><br><br></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We are all vulnerable. There are the truly vulnerable--those who have little or no support systems or safety nets. People who have extraordinary suffering daily. And there is the condition of connecting with the real feelings we have with the suffering around us.There are the vulnerable who need our help. And yet we all need to become more vulnerable--to be more susceptible to our feelings empathy and compassion. Vulnerable are people who are endangered and need help to advance their lives. Vulnerable is also a state of mind and heart that enable us to help the vulnerable.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Still with me?&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">A lot of guilty people, including me, start sentences with "It breaks my heart that......." We need to break our hearts---break them open to the truth and realities of what we want, who we are, and what we are doing about it.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Our capacity for wholehearted living can never be greater than our willingness to be broken-hearted.</strong> &nbsp;Brene Brown</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">From Parker Palmer's book the Healing the Heart of Democracy:</span></p> 
          <div>
           <span style="font-size: 11pt;"><em>“Heart” comes from the Latin cor and points not merely to our emotions but to the core of the self, that center place where all of our ways of knowing converge—intellectual, emotional, sensory, intuitive, imaginative, experiential, relational, and bodily, among others. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The heart is where we integrate what we know in our minds with what we know in our bones, the place where our knowledge can become more fully human.</span> Cor is also the Latin root from which we get the word courage. When all that we understand of self and world comes together in the center place called the heart, we are more likely to find the courage to act humanely on what we know."</em></span>
          </div> 
          <div> 
           <div>
            &nbsp;
           </div> 
           <div> 
            <div>
             <span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>We are all numb and number.</strong> We suffer from an overdose of need. So we shut down our feelings to protect ourselves--or so we think. We use our devices, vices, and bad habits to distract us from reality. We objectify people in need and compartmentalize our feelings to keep moving on. As vulnerability grows around us, our ability to be vulnerable shrinks. We build thicker castle walls and deeper moats to protect us from these emotions. There is an internal war of trying to feel and trying not to feel too much. Numbness is winning.</span>
            </div> 
           </div> 
          </div> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">My favorite quote:</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Comfort the afflicted (the vulnerable) and afflict the comfortable (to make us vulnerable). --HL Mencken &nbsp;I added the parenthetical comments to show this dichotomy of vulnerability.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">You still with me?&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>How do we help those in &nbsp;need &nbsp;and our own need to help?&nbsp;</strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We all hesitate to say and do what we think--the things we know are right. We try to suppress our feelings, or hope that the moment will pass. We pretend that the moment and feelings do not matter. We regret those lost moments.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Brene Brown has done groundbreaking research on this latter vulnerability. Her Ted talk is one of the most viewed ever. She found that vulnerability is the source of great insights and development and ultimately a chance to be courageous and say and do things we want to do.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Excerpt from Brene Brown:&nbsp;I<em> cannot find a single example of courage, moral courage, spiritual courage, leadership courage, relational courage, I cannot find a single example of courage in my research that was not born completely of vulnerability. And so I think we buy into some mythology about vulnerability being weakness and being gullibility and being frailty because it gives us permission not to do it.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Please listen to this interview of <span style="color: #0000bf;"><a href="http://www.onbeing.org/program/brene-brown-on-vulnerability/4928" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><strong>Brene Brown</strong></span></a></span> conducted by the inimitable Krista Tippett. If you are slightly open to becoming more vulnerable this will open your mind and your heart.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We share everything but not what we really think and feel. We conform to the crowd not because we agree with them.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">My boss calls it <em>phony nice</em>. But it is more than being honest with one another. It is being honest with oneself.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The present offers so many moments to engage our compassion, empathy, and energy for life. But we squander them. &nbsp;I am trying to change before it is too late.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Awareness is step one.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Force yourself to follow your heart to learn the realities of the vulnerable and become vulnerable. Push yourself into the worlds of suffering you care about. Surrender to the feelings and let them inform you and what you do.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Not talking about serving soup at the midnight mission--although that would not hurt. I am talking about diving into the needs of your network and listen-- before you try to fix things!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle</strong>--a battle you know little about. attributed to Philo</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">What are other people's battles? Seek them out to understand and help.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">What are your battles? What are you numb about? What is your heart saying? Help yourself.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Until we understand our battles we can not connect or mentor. We can not help one another.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Compassion literally means to suffer with others. We cannot have compassion.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Becoming more vulnerable enables us to help the vulnerable. Every person has a battle. Every person has dreams. Every person wants to have an open heart and the courage to act on their true goodness.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In my greyness I am coming to realize that Brene Brown and Parker Palmer are right. Pursue vulnerability by becoming more vulnerable. Struggle over real things and real feelings is a battle, a battle worth fighting, battles we must try to win over numbness.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Thanks for reading. John</span></p>

          <p><em>I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the Ku Klux Klanner but the moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice</span>; who constantly says, "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a <strong>"more convenient season."</strong> Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. <strong>Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</strong> <a href="http://www.uscrossier.org/pullias/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/king.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><strong>Excerpts from </strong></span></a></em><a href="http://www.uscrossier.org/pullias/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/king.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><strong>MLK’s Birmingham Jail Letter</strong></span></a></p> 
          <p>Please do not be one of those people who say they are colorblind. That all people are equal in your eyes. Even if that were true, your blindness would mean you do not care about difference. And difference is everything.</p> 
          <p><strong>Our greatest vulnerability is that we do not see our fates tied to others.</strong> That we believe that our comfort, safety and success can be achieved independently from other people different from us and our families.</p> 
          <p><strong><em>Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.</em></strong></p> 
          <p>The brutal truth is we have minimized our direct experiences with difference. Economic diversity in our lives is from the news. We have little tolerance for difference. The last time we had truly diverse friends was in college.</p> 
          <p>The consequences of these subtle, multiplied, and layered decisions are the increasing inability to relate to the world outside of our bubbles. Our networks are sanitized, pasteurized and free of “unwanted” elements.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>We struggle with relating to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I Can’t Breathe</strong></span> campaigns, Immigration Reform, Muslim hate crimes, Minimum wage protests…...&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>We don't discriminate.</p> 
          <p>We are not prejudiced.</p> 
          <p>We care about all of our fellow human beings.</p> 
          <p>We have lost touch with reality.</p> 
          <p>We are accidental racists.</p> 
          <p>There are&nbsp;<span style="color: #0000bf;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/upshot/the-measuring-sticks-of-racial-bias-.html?_r=0" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000bf;"><strong>so many studies</strong></span></a><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></span>that show how prevalent our discriminatory inclinations are.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>Step one is to own our racism.</p> 
          <p>Now before you launch into your well-rehearsed denial speeches, listen to yourself and look around yourself. “Some of your best friends…..Really! Now why is it that your church, your kids’ schools, your place of employment, your golf club, your circle of friends do not reflect the communities we live in?</p> 
          <p>Admit it we have not done enough.</p> 
          <p><strong>Our kids grow up in segregation and despite our best intentions they become accidental racists.</strong></p> 
          <p>Susan Fiske’s extensive research at Princeton shows that as income rises we see poor people as objects and not as humans—mostly because they are a foreign and unknown population.</p> 
          <p>We watch as the world turns on Muslims again. -Treating a giant diverse population as a monolithic group. A group we do not know. Racism at its best.</p> 
          <p>Conjures up Nazi Germany or WWII with the internment of Japanese Americans…</p> 
          <p>This has been going on for a long time--too long.</p> 
          <p>In 1946 (Martin Luther King Jr. was about 17 and 18 years before Civil Rights), Albert Einstein was frustrated and angry and gave a speech at Lincoln University called, <a href="http://www.onbeing.org/tags/albert-einstein" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000bf;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Negro Question</span></strong></span></a>-- Here are some excerpts:</p> 
          <p><em>Many a sincere person will answer: "Our attitude towards Negroes is the result of unfavorable experiences which we have had by living side by side with Negroes in this country. They are not our equals in intelligence, sense of responsibility, reliability."</em></p> 
          <p><em>The modern prejudice against Negroes is the result of the desire to maintain this unworthy condition.</em></p> 
          <p><em>What, however, can the man of good will do to combat this deeply rooted prejudice? <strong>He must have the courage to set an example by word and deed, and must watch lest his children become influenced by this racial bias.</strong></em></p> 
          <p><em>I do not believe there is a way in which this deeply entrenched evil can be quickly healed. But until this goal is reached there is no greater satisfaction for a just and well-meaning person than the knowledge that he has devoted his best energies to the service of the good cause.</em></p> 
          <p>Sadly, these words ring true today. And “Negroes” could be replaced with many communities which combat our racism today.</p> 
          <p>It is well established that diversity is not a nice to have but a necessity to compete, survive, and evolve. Mother Nature knows this well! Investment portfolios require it. The American Medical Association studies prove that life expectancy is extended as much as 9 years for those that cultivate diverse social networks. <strong>But to attain and then maintain diversity professionally and socially takes courage, work, and vigilance.</strong></p> 
          <p>Evaluate your network. Not talking just about ethnicity, but religious, economic, ability, sexual preference diversity. How will you reach out and build a diverse network?</p> 
          <p>What example by word and deed are we setting, for our children?</p> 
          <p>If the tables you sit at just look like you, I do not care how smart, witty you are, it is limited table of opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Men go abroad to wonder at the heights of mountains, at the huge waves of the sea, at the long courses of the rivers, at the vast compass of the ocean, at the circular motions of the stars, and they pass by themselves without wondering.</strong> &nbsp;St Augustine</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Maybe it is the new year, maybe it is my stage in life, maybe it is the truth that is emerging around me. While I have been saying this for many years, ...."the most important connection, the first connection you must make is to yourself," this idea has&nbsp;</span> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c730c5b8970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Key-in-door-1024x685" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b7c730c5b8970b img-responsive" height="223" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c730c5b8970b-300wi" style="width: 288px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Key-in-door-1024x685"></a><span style="font-size: 11pt;">more meaning and power than ever before. Let me explain.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I have always been drawn to thinkers and writers who have expounded on passion, meaning, and purpose. I strongly believe that without these elements driving one's life you will be lost in a series of transactional moments that may not add up to what you wanted. Life is not your resume. It is not a list of achievements sans failures and challenges. It is not a string of happy moments, interrupted by sad moments. Your life is a precious and amazing opportunity, everyday to do good as you define it. To do what you love to do. To make a difference. Intuitively I know you get this. But doing it is rough.&nbsp;<br></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">So I am constantly looking for the clues, the inspirations, the insights of others who can show me the way. The way to more persistently becoming myself. Becoming and understanding myself so I can overcome so many self erected barriers to my own path.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Lot of popular notions out there that I am sure you have noted. The Ms are very popular:</span></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Mindfulness</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Meaning</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Meditation</span></li> 
          </ul> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Ps are also competing for your interests:</span></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Presence</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Purpose</span></li> 
           <li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Passion</span></li> 
          </ul> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">So the M's and the P's are powerful words that are all on the endangered species list of words that become diluted through popular usage.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I have been recently &nbsp;influenced by words and ideas from Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning, Sherwin&nbsp;Nuland's The Way We Live (and Die),&nbsp;E. O. Wilson's The Meaning of Human Existence,&nbsp;Brene Brown on Vulnerability, anything from the&nbsp;Dalai Lama, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://onbeing.org/" style="color: #0000bf;" target="_blank">Krista Tippett's show On Being</a></strong></span>, Bernard Glassman's Instruction to the Cook....</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This is not a book list for you to buy. I am resisting giving you snippets and quotes here. You should subscribe to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/" style="color: #0000bf;" target="_blank">Brain Pickings</a></strong></span> for extraordinary summaries of important literature, including some of these sources I have listed. There are so many great sources of smart people thinking about these questions out there. Find things that speak to You.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Engage and enhance your network to talk about these issues.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Like you, I continue to find my place. Someone said to me the other day, "I wish I was like you. You have a purpose and a plan." Wow did I fool him :)</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Tis one thing to speak and write about it, tis another thing to do it.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">There is lots of research on life satisfaction. The work of Hannes Schwandt is particularly fascinating. Builds on research that spans 50 countries and many socio-economic groups. This is what I have interpreted. The peak of peak of happiness is 85. 85! There is this U shape to our life satisfaction. Starts high and goes steadily down until 45ish and then builds back up and reaches a high point in the mid 80's. Why?, Because when we are young we have "overly -optimistic" read unrealistic expectations about our lives. We want a lot. We have dreams and ambitions untethered to terra firma. This creates disappointment. College majors and aspirations turn out differently and life happens. In the late 40's and through the 50's we have another moment of reality. Expectations (different from aspirations) are super high. Was this what I was meant to do? Is this all there is? Financial realities take their toll. Each stage you shed more and more of what is unrealistic and our optimism takes a seat at the back of the bus. By the time you are in your 80's you simply do not care any more. This is the brutal phrase from the research, "...unmet expectations are abandoned and less regret is experienced..." Regrets evaporate. Time is very short so let's not waste any more. You are old and very happy. Is this maturity or the ultimate death of our dreams?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I am not saying this is going to happen to you, but it is happening. Apparently it happens like clockwork according to the researchers. I know you are not "average", after all you are reading my blog. :) And we can take the safeties off our blamethrowers and aim them many places. For me, shedding all of the expectations of others and society is a great starting point. If you are honest with yourself you have to sort through what is YOU from what is not. This is the ultimate preventive measure against the gravitational pull of the U curve. Turn this U into YOU. &nbsp;As I said at the beginning, it starts with you, the key connection you have to make.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I know it can feel like a runaway train that does not respond to herculean tugs on the emergency cord. But you got to stop the train and take a walk with yourself. To listen to YOU. To hear your heartbeat and the voice within. There is a small penitentiary within you of trapped ideas, emotions, and yes dreams that yearn for your company, attention and the light of day.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I wish I could hand you the next three steps to You. I would if I had them. But you are unique. You are also on a human trajectory that has predictable elements and phases. Maybe true happiness is when we get to an age and stage where we have abandoned all unrealistic things, we regret nothing because we don't care any more, and we appreciate life because it is ending. Some research says so. I am not going to allow it to happen for me.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I want to eliminate regrets before they accumulate and take up precious shelf space and then I will have fewer "unmet expectations".</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Chumash native americans have a saying in one of their blessings that always jolts me:</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"When you are born you begin to die."</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Time is a luxury. Do not take it for granted. You never get it back.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I still believe in change. For me and for the world. I have research that says that it is possible. :)</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I believe that you can change. I see it everyday. But no one can make the change but You. And there it goes again, we return to You and to see ourselves anew.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I am wishing You the greatest year of your life. Make it a bit optimistic and unrealistic. :)</span></p>

         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Wishing is one of the most powerful forms of articulating our needs. Seems like the holidays and the New Year bring out our wishes more than any other time. &nbsp;We hear a wish and want it to happen. Think Make-A-Wish Foundation. The idea that something hard to get might be attainable is hopeful and inspiring. Everybody has wishes. What are yours? And what are the people around you, people you care deeply about , wishing for? Not what we want! Not gifts, stupid. Not the PS4, the iPhone6, or a Prada purse or other meaningless stuff. But a true wish for our lives and well being that comes from our hearts and souls. <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c723a4da970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Wish dandelion_wish_2-t2" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b7c723a4da970b img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b7c723a4da970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Wish dandelion_wish_2-t2"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">When we blow out a birthday candle or throw a penny into a wishing well, we all revert to a childlike state of hoping for a millisecond that something magical can come true. Just before our cynical, impulsive and over-bearing brains take over--we express a real secret thought that has real meaning. But that beautiful moment is trashed by horrific sounds and images of reality!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Reality is the leading cause of stress for those in touch with it.</strong> Jane Wagner</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This is not about you! It rarely is. So dial back the WIIFM (What's In It For Me). Think about people around you, people you love. Do you know their wishes? Really? When is the last time you talked about such wishful thinking?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I have the chance to meet hundreds of people every year through my work, my volunteering, and my presentations. Almost always, I confront people with the Wish Obstacle-something I learned from <span style="color: #0000bf;"><a href="http://www.barbarasher.com/index.htm" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><strong>Barbara Sher</strong></span></a></span>. "I always wanted to_______, but__________ ."I ask people to fill in the blanks and articulate their wish to a stranger in the audience--What their wish is and why they don't have it or even pursue it. It always triggers a robust discussion. The stranger can't help but offer assistance and advice and genuinely wants to help this random and accidental new friend. But the other thing that happens is people blurt out wishes that they have never said to anyone and reveal highly personal thoughts to an innocent bystander! I have learned that we all have these pent up wishes.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Ask a child you will see over the holidays (under 10 years old)--what they are wishing for. After they give you a long list of material things, tell them not a gift and then be quiet-let them think. More often than not the child, oh to have the authenticity of a child, he/she will say something that will blow your mind. Here is a sampling of what I have heard: "I wish mommy and daddy would stop fighting." "I am scared to go in the bathroom at school. I wish they would clean it up." "I wish people would stop hurting each other." Be prepared to talk about their wish and not dismiss their moment of truth. Kids say the darndest things and are we listening?!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">If we knew what people were truly wishing for to make them whole, to give them more fulfillment, even meaning in their lives, then we could help them pursue it--and that would be the greatest gift.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">So what are your friends and family wishing for?</span></p>

            <span style="font-size: 11pt;">My mom and sister in Santa Fe</span>
           </div> 
          </div> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">So a number of years ago I called my Mom and asked her the Wish/Obstacle. She gave me the classic mom answer, "Oh you know I don't need anything." As we all know it is impossible to buy gifts for your mother! But I pushed and told her not a gift, something she wanted. And immediately she said, "I always wanted to go to Santa Fe, but don't think I will ever get there." I had never heard this before and asked why she didn't go to Santa Fe. She said, "Your dad doesn't travel anymore and I probably won't see Santa Fe." That sent me into motion on a mission. I called my brother and sisters and we put together a trip. My sister Tomi went with my mom and they did Santa Fe! A wish fulfilled. Do we know what people are wishing for?!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Now I am going to ratchet it up a notch or three. Now think about the person who you care about but with whom you have a broken relationship. The one that hurts you in your heart. We all have them. We have to repair this relationship for ourselves. We have to avoid the bigger regrets that just will grow over time. As I have said so many times, "Regrets become tumors!" Reach out to this person during the holidays. Why now? Because it is NOW and because the holidays open doors, windows and little cracks of light. So reach out and tell them your wish. "I wish we had a better relationship, but I need your help to make this happen." Don't apologize, don't bring up the past, don't waffle wiggle and wander. Just state your wish. The truth in this wish might re-kindle something, hopefully not more negativity. But you stepped up and out to meet your challenge. This is not a magical gimmick that repairs relationships. It is a starting point for you to take the next step. It is a way for you to say something good to somebody you care about. You need each other.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Wishing does not make anything happen. Helping people get their wishes is a mission.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I wish for all of you to connect to the people you love. To connect to the people who you have lost touch with. To reduce your regrets by helping others and yourself.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Making other people's wishes come true will restore your faith, your childlike faith, in the magic of possibility and the glory of the relationships which matter most.</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Yes, yes, yes--we all need to be more grateful, more thankful for what we have. Feel fortunate and blessed for the opportunities and people in our lives. Yes, and the research shows that if we do this we will be happier and healthier--and live longer. We all agree with this and most of us think we do do these things.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">But how did you get here, to this point in your life? To right now?&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">There are still a few people out there that still believe that they have controlled their own destinies. That they pull the levers of their lives with no help from others and they alone are responsible for their successes. I know this is crazy, but we all know people like this. They live in a mythical &nbsp;"I" world.</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">From the research of </span><a href="http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/author/Robert_Emmons" style="font-size: 11pt;" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><strong>Robert Emmons</strong></span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, an expert on gratitude:</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><em>People who are ungrateful tend to be characterized by an excessive sense of self-importance, arrogance, vanity, and an unquenchable need for admiration and approval. Narcissists reject the ties that bind people into relationships of reciprocity. They expect special favors and feel no need to pay back or pay forward.&nbsp;</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><em>Entitlement is at the core of narcissism. This attitude says, “Life owes me something” or “People owe me something” or “I deserve this.” In all its manifestations, a preoccupation with the self can cause us to forget our benefits and our benefactors or to feel that we are owed things from others and therefore have no reason to feel thankful. <strong>Entitlement and self-absorption are massive impediments to gratitude.</strong> You will certainly not feel grateful when you do receive what you think you have coming, because after all, you have it coming. Counting blessings will be ineffective because grievances will always outnumber gifts.</em></span></p> 
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><em>Were narcissistic entitlement a condition that afflicted only a small percentage of humankind, then there would be little cause for concern.&nbsp;</em></span></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In addition, to your mother who brought you into this world, nothing any of us have done has been done alone. We get help, support, mentorship, inspiration, and energy from others. I am not even talking about our ancestors who suffered and toiled to get us here. My focus here are the people that got you to this NOW.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I think about this everyday. Not because I am such a grateful person although I try. But because I wonder who introduced me to this person I am with?, who helped me get on this board?, who advised me?, &nbsp;who invited me? who hired me? who referred me?....I can't stop thinking about it. It builds this giant ladder, scaffolding, this network &nbsp;around me. The incredible accumulation of help, support, mentoring and ass-kicking I have been lucky to receive.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Yes "I" have been ready for some of this help and support. "I" prepared myself for some opportunities. But if I am honest with myself, I realize that my Net enables me to Work. My Network is behind me, beside me, and below me to push. catch and pull me. Yes, I have to have goals and ideas and passion, but without the network I am not empowered to succeed.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We careen through life and our orbits, trajectories, and perspectives are changed by every encounter with people and experiences. But certain people have influenced you and helped you more than others. &nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I am because we are.&nbsp;I am what I am because of who we all are.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2010/04/out-of-your-comfort-zone-networking.html%20" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000bf;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Ubuntu</span></strong></span></a></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I am constantly humbled by these thoughts. (And some would tell you, that makes my healthy self concept more tolerable! :) So I try to let the people who got me here know how I am doing and to thank them for their help. When I do this, it always makes both of us feel good. Like a little life loop was closed. And I try to help anyone who asks for help, not because I expect something in return but because that's what people did for me. Pay it forward. Pay it back. But give thanks to the help we get and the help we give.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This is what propels us. This is the fuel for our lives.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">But once you start believing your own bio, your own press releases, you can start to hallucinate that you have designed your own life.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Who got you here?</strong> The list is long. Take a moment to appreciate your Network. Then drop a few of them a note, a text, an e-mail, a call to thank them for helping you get here. Not just this week, but anytime you think of it. This not a holiday thing, this is a gratitude thing. This is a network thing.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">There is no "I" in network. (sorry could not resist)</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Yes let's be grateful and filled with gratitude--then let's acknowledge and thank the people that got us here--everyday!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Thank you for helping me get to this point in my life by allowing me to express myself and to connect with you. Thanks for reading. John</span></p>

         <h5 class="date-header font-dateheader"> <span class="entry-date"><a href="http://www.swiveltime.com/2014/11/our-philanthropic-journey.html">November 16, 2014</a></span> </h5> 
         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody"> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Most of us do not relate to the word philanthropy. It is Bill Gatesian, John Rockefelleresque, foreign word that is reserved for the Bentley crowd. Even wealthy donors do not use the "P" word. Yet the literal meaning of <em>philanthropy&nbsp;</em>is beautiful. From its Greek origins it translates to Love of Humanity. In other words giving is a way of expressing our love for one another.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Regrettably only a few of us can be on the Forbes 400, but all of us give. We give as much as we can. Most of us could give more---time and money--but we all have a generous spirit.&nbsp; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d08fcb93970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Philanthropist" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b8d08fcb93970c img-responsive" src="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/.a/6a00e554e88723883301b8d08fcb93970c-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Philanthropist"></a></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Yet giving away money is a mysterious business. To the uninformed, giving away a lot of money would be easy and fun. Like most things it is not what you think it is. I was with a nameless billionaire the other day (you are so important John!!) and he complained about the "burden" of his giving--that "there is no way I can give away all of my money before I die." I know some of you just want a name and and contact info :) But in all serious pursuits, in all careers--when you fully engage yourself in the art and science of something--challenges are revealed. You begin to realize how much you do not know. It can paralyze you or it can liberate you. To most it causes a brain freeze bigger than chugging a giant milkshake.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Funny thing, people with wealth or any extra money will tell you they love their philanthropy. They will tell you how fulfilling it is. Similar to any of us when asked about our computer skills--no one is not "proficient"! People who give away money who generally have been successful in life find it hard to admit that their philanthropy is transactional, random, and a "burden".</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">As I have said in this space for years, the key principle in life is to <strong>give without an expectation</strong>. Be ready to give first. Lead with your giving. Not just money, but with your attention, time, and expertise. When you are truly philanthropic with your life and have turned off WIIFM (what's in it for me), you benefit in ways that far exceed your giving.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.&nbsp;</strong>Picasso</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">All of our journeys are philanthropic. We do not have to be billionaires to make a difference. We forget how much we have when we focus on what we want. We love humanity but do not know where to begin.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">As you know I help people give their money away. But I have learned that if the giving is not tied to the donor's heart, passions, their authentic interests, their core values, then their philanthropy is limited and unfulfilling. Giving becomes a task even a source of stress (like with my new billionaire buddy:). That's how many people feel about networking and mentoring. We can view time as our greatest asset and we become time hoarders--or so we think. We view it as precious and hold it back from others on one hand and then just waste it like we have all of the time in the world.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I literally get sick when people say things like, "Can't wait until this day/month/year is over!" You never get the time back. You can get your money back! Time is irretrievable.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Reminded of Seneca's incredible 2000 year old book <em>On the Shortness of Life</em>.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">It is not that we have a short time to live, but we make it short by wasting a lot of it. We are frugal in guarding our personal property, but as it comes to squandering time, we are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy.</span></em></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Do I have to regale you with the physical, spiritual, intellectual benefits of giving? The increase in endorphins, oxytocin or just plain old satisfaction. Studies abound that show that generous people are happier, live longer and are healthier. In the newish book, <span style="color: #0060bf;"><span style="color: #0000bf;"><strong><a href="http://www.wpr.org/shows/paradox-generosity" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000bf;">The Paradox of Generosity</span></a></strong></span><span style="color: #111111;">, philanthropic families "had broader social circles, less self absorbed, and a greater sense of purpose." I had the great pleasure of interviewing Nicholas Kristof about his new book <a href="http://apathappears.org/book/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><strong>A Path</strong></span><span style="color: #0000bf;"><strong> Appears</strong></span></a>, perhaps the best book on philanthropy I have read. This is like 8 great books in one. And Nicholas and his partner Sheryl have done a wonderful job of making the case to give more and how to do it.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><span style="color: #0060bf;"><span style="color: #111111;">It is also well known and verified through research that you give like your network. If you live in a gated community you give 40% less than the average American! Because wealthy people who live in wealthy communities are trying to keep up with the Joneses. If you hang out with people who are less generous, chances are you are too. And "live more cynical and narrow lives" according to the research. Giving broadens your network to new worlds. Worlds outside of our bubbles, "gated communities" of homogeneous people who reinforce each other's perspective disconnected from reality. <a href="http://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/fiske/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><strong>Susan Fiske's research at Princeton</strong></span></a> is the most disheartening. The wealthier we are the more we view poor people as objects instead of people. In other words, when we reside in a biosphere protected from the harsh realities of the real world, poor people are things not human.</span></span></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">So reach out and connect. break your bubbles and break out of your biospheres. Seek people and charities you love and help them. Get the benefits of giving and giving more.&nbsp;</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">So as we meander down our philanthropic paths, consider how much you have and start giving it away. Lead with your giving and it will take you to places that you want to go. Places that show you purpose, meaning, and why you are here.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I developed a special edition of my SWiVEL doc&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000bf;"><strong><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a00e554e88723883301b8d08fc5c1970c img-responsive"><a href="http://jeknetwork.typepad.com/files/swivel-philanthropy_2014.doc"><span style="color: #0000bf; text-decoration: underline;">Download SWIVEL Philanthropy_2014</span></a></span></strong>&nbsp;</span>for people to help one another with their philanthropy. Share it.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I get so much out of writing these posts--way more than you! Thank you for the gift of your readership. John</span></p>
