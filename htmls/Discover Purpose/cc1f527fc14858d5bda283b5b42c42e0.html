He co-founded Coronado Brewing Company, launched the acclaimed SEALFIT&nbsp;program that provides transformational&nbsp;personal and team training experiences, and developed the Unbeatable Mind&nbsp;training, an integrated warrior development academy for the mind, body and spirit.

This is the story of brain gone haywire that led to a life transformed.

Guest: A married mother of two young kids,&nbsp;Potter spent 16 years as an award-winning broadcast producer in London. Then, in October 2012 fate conspired to turn the lights out on her, and overnight she found herself blind and unable to walk.

Vanessa’s response, was anything but usual.&nbsp;She began to document the entire journey on audio. Her curiosity and quest for answers led her to Cambridge University persuading neuroscientists to help her research what was happening in her brain, This led to a powerful collaboration on a brainwave-imaging project that invited members of the public to see and hear their own brainwaves translated into music and art.

Potter was invited to give a TEDx talk and recently&nbsp;shared more of her story in her first,&nbsp;Patient H69: The Story of my Second Sight. In today's Good Life Project podcast, we talk about what led to that fateful day, what actually happened in her body and brain, the incredibly unusual way she learned to cope and then thrive with a new reality, and how she is today.

Good Life Riff:&nbsp;Today, we've got a special guest riff, featuring friend-of-the-pod, New York Times bestselling author, podcaster, world-traveler and entrepreneur, Chris Guillebeau. In his new book, Side Hustle, Guillebeau takes a contrarian view of entrepreneurship, arguing many of us are better off doing that thing that blends passion with money not as our day jobs, but on the side. He shares why, along with a few great case-studies, in today's riff. Grab a copy of Side Hustle, and check out his 100-city tour today!

Good Life Science: And, in our Good Life Science segment, we're diving into some fascinating new research on how we respond to failure. Turns out, all those people who say, &quot;hey, don't take it personally, don't get all emotional, just let it be a teaching moment and move on&quot; may be giving you bad advice. A new study shows that responding emotionally to failure, instead of rationally, may just set you up to be more likely to succeed in a future endeavor. And, as always, for those want to go to the source, here's a link to the full study.

A lifelong student of meditation and meditative practices, Daniel Goleman spent two years in India, first as a Harvard Predoctoral Traveling Fellow and then again on a Post-Doctoral Fellowship, followed by decades of practice and study. He has moderated several Mind and Life dialogues between the Dalai Lama and scientists, ranging from topics such as Emotions and Health to Environment, Ethics and Interdependence.

In his new book,&nbsp;Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain and Body,&nbsp;he pulls back the curtain on this practice, dives into the claims and show what's fact and what's pretty seriously stretching the truth. The bad news, there's a whole lot of fiction in the meditation space. The good news is, there are also many profoundly life-enhancing changes that come your way. Meditation, it turns out, changes you, on the level of DNA. In this conversation, you'll discover the real benefits of this powerful practice.

           <td role="gridcell" sort-value="Guest:&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;Lukach is a teacher and freelance writer. His work has been published in the New York Times, The Atlantic, Pacific Standard, Wired, and other publications.

He is currently the ninth grade dean at The Athenian School, where he also teaches history. He lives with his wife, Giulia, and their son in the San Francisco Bay area.

His latest book, a heart-wrenching memoir, is called My Lovely Wife in the Psych Ward.&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;first wrote about Giulia in a New York Times “Modern Love” column and again in a piece for Pacific Standard Magazine, which was the magazine’s most-read article in 2015.

Story: During his freshman year in college, Mark spotted the love of his life across the quad and immediately knew he would spend the rest of his life with her. They became inseparable: they graduated together, married, and began building an exquisite life with dreams, hopes and expectations. Until one day he came home to find his lovely wife living in a radically different world – a state that he now knows to be deep psychosis. Staying profoundly committed to each other, Mark and Giulia learned to navigate the challenging times and rebuild their lives and their family.

Big Idea: In today’s world of the &quot;ideal life&quot;, as portrayed by social media, people yearn to be open and vulnerable, and have authentic conversations about what they are going through. They are desperate for deep human-to-human connection without trying to pretend that things are better.

You’d never guess: How Mark and Giulia, as a couple, came up with a plan to deal with potential future psychotic relapses without totally disrupting their lives.

Current passion project: Mark works as a 9th Grade Dean, helping families with the transition from middle school to high school.

Gretchen Rubin is the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;bestselling author of several books, including&nbsp;The Four Tendencies,&nbsp;Better Than Before&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Happiness Project.

On her weekly podcast&nbsp;Happier with Gretchen Rubin, she discusses good habits and happiness with her sister Elizabeth Craft.

Want to hear more from Gretchen? Listen here to her 2015 conversation with Jonathan.

About The Four Tendencies:&nbsp;

During her investigation into understanding human nature, Gretchen discovered that when it comes to our ability to start and stick with anything, people fit into Four Tendencies: Upholders, Questioners, Obligers, and Rebels. Our Tendency shapes every aspect of our behavior, so using this framework allows us to make better decisions, meet deadlines, suffer less stress, and succeed in nearly anything meaningful.

Big Idea: Gretchen&nbsp;reveals the surprising truth about the four hidden personality types or tendencies that drive everything we do. Learn how to understand yourself better—and also how to influence others more effectively.

Current passion project: Her new book, The Four Tendencies: The Indispensable Personality Profiles That Reveal How to Make Your Life Better (and Other People's Lives Better, Too). Join more than 600,000 people and learn more about your tendency by taking&nbsp;The Four Tendencies quiz here.&nbsp;

Her latest book, LOVE WARRIOR is a #1 New York Times Bestseller and the Oprah's Book Club selection.

I sat down with Glennon the morning after she had wrapped one of her gatherings at the legendary BAM (Brooklyn Academy of Music) in New York City, where she was joined by a multi-denominational collective on-stage, including Alicia Keys who was so moved she couldn't help but belt out an impromptu song before leaving.

In this conversation, we dip into her memoir. But that's more of a jumping off point that leads us into some very different waters, from leading as an introvert, her feelings about faith and how it informs what she's creating to how she's moving into a season of her life where the line between public and private, art and service, love and leading is shifting in profound and intentional ways.

We go deep into some provocative territory here, and there are more than a few invitations to reconsider how you move into the world and what you choose to focus on. Agree or not, this is a conversation that'll leave you lifted, challenge your assumptions and also make you think and feel.

We first aired this conversation in October 2016. Since then, so much has unfolded in both in Glennon's life and in the world. I'm so excited to share this &quot;Best Of&quot; episode with you now, as a continued reflection on what matters in your own life, and how you might bring it to the world.

Glennon's publishing team loved this conversation as much as I did, and you can now find the transcript of much of it in the new paperback version of her book. So, be sure to check it out.

We go deep into some provocative territory here, and there are more than a few invitations to reconsider how you move into the world and what you choose to focus on. Agree or not, this is a conversation that'll leave you lifted, challenge your assumptions and also make you think and feel. We first aired this conversation in October 2016. Since then, so much has unfolded in both in Glennon's life and in the world. I'm so excited to share this "Best Of" episode with you now, as a continued reflection on what matters in your own life, and how you might bring it to the world. Glennon's publishing team loved this conversation as much as I did, and you can now find the transcript of much of it in the new paperback version of her book. So, be sure to check it out.

Since then, she's published a series of books, given a TED talk on creative genius that's been viewed more than 10 million times, become&nbsp;a leading voice on the pursuit of a creative, connected and vital life.

Gilbert's book, Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear, takes you deeper into what it means to live a creative life, offering a wonderful blend of wisdom, unabashed magical thinking, amazing stories and a whole lot of unexpected myth-busting and contrarian insights.

I had a chance to sit down with Liz and, as often happens with these Good Life conversations, we ended up going all sorts of places I'd never planned. We touched on the power of curiosity and the fallacy of passion, where creativity comes from, what stops us from doing the thing we're here to do, the importance of caring for your vessel, what happens when you think you've reached the end of your capacity and her powerful lens on what it means to live a good life.

This is deeply moving, revealing, insightful and sometimes pretty funny conversation. In fact, we begin with a hard-hitting reveal of a relationship that Gilbert had kept secret for more than four decades. And, along the way, this beautiful thought came tumbling forth:

&quot;When you come to the end of yourself is where all the interesting stuff starts.&quot; Tweet this.

If you've ever wondered how to step into a creative life, how to get that thing in your head and heart out into the world, this is an absolute &quot;do not miss&quot; conversation.

We first aired this conversation in September 2015. We're so excited to share this timeless &quot;Best Of&quot; episode with you today.

From studying Comparative Literature and French to becoming the head of marketing at mega-brands like Nike, OWN, National Geographic Channels and Fox International, Liz Dolan has taken the world of big business by storm.

But in between these high-profile gigs, she found herself diving into deeply personal endeavors and side-hustles, with a focus on creativity, media and storytelling.

Most recently, she left the world of mega-business to host a great podcast, I Hate My Boss, where Dolan and co-host, Larry Seal, help people navigate the drama, highs, lows and angsty moments of modern-day work. And as a fun bonus, on the same day we're airing her conversation on Good Life Project, GLP founder, Jonathan Fields, is also featured on I Hate My Boss.

That's the question we're asking today's guest,&nbsp;Eric&nbsp;Barker.&nbsp;A former Hollywood screen-writer turned blogger, he shares&nbsp;science-based answers and expert insight on how to be awesome at life with his more than&nbsp;300,000 subscribers. Barker's content is also syndicated by Time Magazine, The Week, and Business Insider&nbsp;and he&nbsp;has been featured in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic Monthly, and the Financial Times. His first book &quot;Barking Up the Wrong Tree&quot; is a Wall Street Journal bestseller.

Story: Eric dives deep into the psychology of how we act in the world, often focusing on the paradoxes. The weird things we do and bringing research to illuminate&nbsp;why we do, how we do it. and trying to give us good wisdom to how we live our lives.&nbsp;

Big idea: His deep fascination with human psychology&nbsp;grew a pretty giant global platform.

You’d never guess: He posted a Facebook ad in 2009 when he graduated school to get a job. He also has an undergrad in Philosophy, a degree Entertainment Production and an MBA in Marketing.

Current passion project: Reading up on The Dark Triad, the three personality characteristics that are nefarious, or evil: narcissism,&nbsp;Machiavellianism, and&nbsp;psychopathy.

Over the years, this has taken the form of books, her top-ranked TED talk, strategic advising for some of the largest, most-innovative companies in the world and game-changing startups, as well as being a member of organizational teams responsible for global impact and billions in product revenue.

Her conclusion, indeed we do. And,&nbsp;we're living in times that, maybe for the first time ever, have made it possible for people who've been marginalized, disenfranchised and stripped of power to bring forth and build momentum around ideas that, in her words, are mighty enough to &quot;dent the world.&quot; Merchant explores these ideas in her intriguing new book,&nbsp;The Power of Onlyness: Make Your Wild Ideas Mighty Enough to Dent the World.

Big idea: Every single one of us has the ability to contribute. The fact that we don’t is the society’s greatest problem and the greatest opportunity.

You’d never guess:&nbsp;How one woman was able to sway the decision of a group of Pakistani tribal leaders to change the way they create justice.

           <td role="gridcell" sort-value="Guest:&nbsp;For almost three decades&nbsp;Caroline&nbsp;Adams Miller, MAPP has been a leading voice in applying the science of goal-setting, grit, happiness and success.

In 2015, she was named “one of the ten Positive Psychology coaches to follow.” Her latest book is, Getting Grit: The Evidence-Based Approach to Cultivating Passion, Perseverance, and Purpose.

Story: A fiercely-competitive athlete and academic even in her youth, Miller was exposed to Bulimia at the age of 14 and turned to it as an outlet and control mechanism. Outwardly successful by every external measure, she eventually attended Harvard, got married and started a family, all the while keeping her disorder secret. Until one day, gripped by the need to control her disorder any more, she began to reveal her secret life and seek help.

Fortunately, she heard the right words at the right time during a support group meeting, which helped turn her life into one of purpose. Caroline drew upon this life-changing experience to write a book about bulimia that exposed the disorder in a way that is still saving lives. That also started her down the road to understanding the human condition, studying positive psychology, writing a series of books and eventually focusing in on goal-setting and grit.

Big idea: Grit is only good when it’s used for the right reasons, in the right context, and awes and inspires other people to play bigger and be better.

You’d never guess: Why Caroline’s great-great-grandfather was in Abraham Lincoln’s Honorary Guard and why Lincoln and other presidents frequented his store in Washington D.C.

Current passion project: Educating thousands of people around the world on the science of goal-setting, grit and their intersection with Positive Psychology.

Today's riff topic.

When does it makes sense to go all-in on a new career, business or idea and &quot;burn the ships&quot; so you have to succeed, OR do it on the side and take the &quot;safer&quot; and less-disruptive approach? Hint - anyone who tells you to do one or the other without asking a critical question first...is very likely wrong!

Today's Good Life Science Update.

We all know that fruits and veggies can make us healthier, improve energy and reduce&nbsp;risk&nbsp;of disease. But, did you know that they also may make you more curious, creative, upbeat and cultivate a deeper sense of purpose? Some&nbsp;very interesting research&nbsp;suggests that veggies just might be&nbsp;power&nbsp;tools in ways we never imagined! And, we're breaking it down for you in today's GL Science Update.

Story: Training at the Royal Academy of London, Agapi wanted to build a career in performing arts. But it seems the universe conspired to create a different path. Struggling to find her way on the stage and screen, she changed direction and instead pursued a Masters in psychology, seeking to inspire and elevate people not by taking on the persona of other characters, but by taking the stage as herself and sharing her own, very personal stories,&nbsp;ideas&nbsp;and wisdom.

Big idea(s): If you’re stuck and you can’t seem to break out of it, help someone else get what they need and you’ll automatically be empowered.

You’d never guess: How spontaneously performing Joan of Arc to a stranger on&nbsp;a NYC&nbsp;bus kick-started her career.

Current passion project: Speaking and facilitating workshops around the world on changing the way people work, helping them reclaim their lives and move from merely surviving to thriving.

Please enjoy&nbsp;this guided meditation, titled, Let Love In,&nbsp;from Chapter 13 of&nbsp;Wake Up to the Joy of You.

Nobody gets to opt out of the human condition.

What if leading and living a good life wasn't about learning and practicing our way out of the realities of day-to-day existence, but rather owning the fact that, no matter what may come our way, the essential ingredients for a meaningful existence are here, in front of us, in each moment? Even the hard ones. What if a good life is not a place at which we arrive, but a lens through which we see and create our world?

That's what we're talking about in today's GLP Riff. And, as part of that discussion, we offer a question to ask that just might guide better decisions as we tell the story of our lives.

He is an eloquent advocate of the relevance of Eastern ideas to our daily lives. In doing so, he has become a leading voice of the value of reason, peace, and compassion. Thurman was named one of&nbsp;TIME&nbsp;magazine’s 25 most influential Americans and has been profiled by&nbsp;The New York Times Magazine&nbsp;and&nbsp;People&nbsp;magazine. He is the author of many&nbsp;books,&nbsp;and played a central role in the new graphic biography,&nbsp;Man of Peace: The Illustrated Life Story of the Dalai Lama of Tibet.




Story:&nbsp;After losing an eye in an accident at a young age, Thurman was suddenly confronted with impermanence and death. Shortly after, he embarked on a life-changing journey and exploration of Tibetan Buddhism and culture, building a close relationship with the Dalai Lama, and becoming a prominent Buddhist teacher and scholar.

Big idea(s):&nbsp;A lot of spirituality is skewed into an idea of escaping from&nbsp;relationship&nbsp;and transcending into some vastness. What if that vastness existed already in the life you were already living, but you just didn't see it?

Every relative thing is empty of any non-relative element.

By knowing reality, you transcend the idea that you’re more special than others, and their heartbeat becomes as important to you as your own.

You’d never guess: 

Why Bob abandoned his education in the spring of his senior year of high school.

Current passion project:

A graphic novel biography of Dalai Lama – story of one man taking on an empire, calling for truth, peace, and justice for his Tibetan people.

Story: Growing up in South Africa, Susan lost her father at a young age. During this pivotal time, everyday heroes emerged in her life, helping to guide her through her grief as an experience of resilience and emotional agility. This became the foundation of her quest to understand and improve the human condition.

Susan David resilienceBig idea(s): Instead of simply &quot;pushing through&quot; to positivity, there are practical ways that we can be with ourselves and our emotions that begin to activate our readiness potential, goal setting, and capability to make real change in our lives. Our emotions have evolved to help us survive in the world. If we push them aside, we lose our ability to respond effectively. Courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is being able to notice your fear and your disquiet and chose the right thing to do, in alignment with your values.

You’d never guess: How Susan’s teacher’s &quot;intervention&quot; sparked her entire career and ultimately helped form her view of herself as resilient and capable in the world.

Current passion project: Researching and teaching others about our emotions, hidden drivers, and below-the-radar impulses, and how they Ȋcontrolȋ us when we interact with the world and others around us.

Thing about these moments, the always include giant leaps of faith.

There is no way to know or prove you'll succeed at something big and new, before you actually do it.

In fact, if you could prove it's success in advance, that tells you it's not actually big or new. Because, the only way to do that is if you've already done it before, or if someone else has. Then, it's no longer the revolution you'd hoped it might be.

So, when you are faced with the decision to say yes or no, to allocate time, money, energy or resources to something potentially game-changing, where you don't know how it's going to end, how do you make THOSE decisions? On THAT level?

Do you trust others? Do you look for data? Do you trust your intuition?

His latest book is The Spark and the Grind: Ignite the Power of Disciplined Creativity

Story: Erik lost everything when the early dot-com bubble burst, then turned to art as a form of healing, expression and a new way to share ideas, with a focus on street art and graffiti. He then taught himself how to paint large-scale street art style images at high-speed and transformed the process into riveting live shows with a powerful message.

Big idea: Redefining what it means to be a successful artist.

You'd never guess: Why he competed in the world series of poker to enhance creativity and experiential learning, and how he uses game theory as a way to grow emotional intelligence.

Current passion project: Extreme biohacking for creativity (cryotherapy, fasting, ballistic exercise).

We do a bunch of myth-busting and share some eye-opening science-based realities that may not play all that nicely with many of the proverbs we so often see and hear around social media (the ones that also let us feel good about saying &quot;it doesn't matter&quot;).

Money, it turns out, may well matter more than you think, and in ways you didn't realize. Moving beyond money, happiness and good life myth-busting, we then give you specific advice on how to &quot;use&quot; money to make your life better. And, we explore the next logical question,&quot;how much money do you really need to be happy and fulfilled?&quot;

Is it even possible to be truly addicted to these things? You know, like on the level of drugs? Or are we all just being a bit too alarmist?

Where is the line between a healthy obsession that adds to your life and an addiction to tech that can own and potentially destroy you?

Today's guest, NYU professor, Adam Alter, gives us a massive reality check. He breaks down the different between passions, obsessions and straight-up addictions, splits apart chemical and behavioral addictions and shows how technology is being specifically designed to get and keep us hooked.

Alter also offers some powerful tools to better understand when technology is owning us, rather than the other way around, then show how to reclaim the power in the relationship.

His new book,&nbsp;Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked, is a powerful look at how we interact with technology and how it is being designed to create relentless behavioral addiction that can become nearly impossible to break.

An electric shock of unknown original seemed to randomly radiate across her face. But it would be many more years, deep into her practice as a physician, before additional symptoms would lead to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

Within three years, she found herself largely confined to a tilt-recline wheelchair and was told that her condition had progressed quickly. Function, once lost, she learned, would never come back. Being a doctor, she accepted this and began treatment, the only goal to try to slow the progression. Medication seemed to be failing her. But, in the background, she began to research related conditions and started to focus on the then maverick offshoot known as functional medicine.

What happened over the next few years defied what the entire medical profession thought possible. Developing her own food-based protocol, she was able to not only stop the&nbsp;progression,&nbsp;but regain strength and function. And, along with that, came hope, energy and a sense of mission. In the intervening years, Wahls has now brought her ideas to the world through a viral TED talk, books,&nbsp;trainings, research and is now conducting clinical trials to bring her protocol to more people living with MS, as well as other neurodegenerative conditions.

In this powerful conversation, we explore her journey, the decline in health and ability and acceptance that reversal or recovery was not possible. We dive into the detailed steps and research that uncovered a radically different approach and the deeply emotional moment hope returned and she realized there was a different way. We also talk about how hard it is to bring radical eyes to a very established profession, the difference between hope and false hope and how her experience has shaped the lives of her family as well.

Terry's entire approach is detailed in her book,&nbsp;The Wahls&nbsp;Protocol&nbsp;and her new recipe book,&nbsp;The Wahls Protocol Cooking for Life.

           <td role="gridcell" sort-value="Danielle LaPorte is soul-personified.

I've known her for nearly a decade, and in that time, while so much has changed, one thing has remained consistent. Her fierce devotion to truth, to love, to kindness and the creation of beauty.

Over that same time, she's left a trail of both massive successes and a few equally-notable misses. What I love about D is, she wouldn't have it any other way. Because it's that path, all of it, the spiritual nature of evolution and entrepreneurship, creation and destruction that's led her to this place in her life. Being deeply-present and utterly lit-up.

Along the way, LaPorte has become an&nbsp;invited member of Oprah’s inaugural Super Soul 100, authored and produced The Fire Starters Sessions, The Desire Map, a stunning series of planner planners, a top 10 iTunes app, and an international workshop program with licensed facilitators in 15 countries and a rapidly-growing company.

Her new book, White Hot Truth&nbsp;is now available for pre-sale and it lives up to its name. LaPorte wanted to write this book 7 years ago.

I've known her for nearly a decade, and in that time, while so much has changed, one thing has remained consistent. Her fierce devotion to truth, to love, to kindness and the creation of beauty. Over that same time, she's left a trail of both massive successes and a few equally-notable misses. What I love about D is, she wouldn't have it any other way. Because it's that path, all of it, the spiritual nature of evolution and entrepreneurship, creation and destruction that's led her to this place in her life. Being deeply-present and utterly lit-up. Along the way, LaPorte has become an&nbsp;invited member of Oprah’s inaugural Super Soul 100, authored and produced The Fire Starters Sessions, The Desire Map, a stunning series of planner planners, a top 10 iTunes app, and an international workshop program with licensed facilitators in 15 countries and a rapidly-growing company. Her new book, White Hot Truth&nbsp;is now available for pre-sale and it lives up to its name. LaPorte wanted to write this book 7 years ago.

That's the question that has obsessed with week's guest, Dan Lerner, for his entire adult life.

The son of world-class classical musicians and an accomplished cellist himself at an early age, he was exposed to a world of devotion and mastery. He saw people in this community who'd figured out how to build a living around what they loved, become masters of their craft and also live rich, joyous, connected and full lives outside their careers. And, he assumed that's just &quot;the way it was.&quot;

TUntil he took a job as an agent representing many of the best musicians in the world, and learned the cold, hard truth. For so many, the quest to be the best came not with fulfillment, but with abandonment of relationships, health, self-care and any semblance of humanity. He believed there had to be a different way.

This led Dan on a quest away from agenting and found him studying with legendary professors in the world of performance and positive psychology. He eventually pursued a Masters degree in positive psychology, became a&nbsp;strengths-based performance coach working with elite performing artists, athletes and executives and found himself teaching at NYU and University of Pennsylvania.

He now co-teaches the most popular elective class&nbsp;at New York University, “The Science of Happiness,” and his new book, “U Thrive: How to Succeed in College (and Life), is a compelling deep-dive into how to not just excel in academics or work, but how to do it in a way that also let's you live a great life along the way.

She's also known as a human lie-detector, master of influence and someone who has spent her adult life decoding human interaction, influence, social and power dynamics, charisma, likability and more.

As a geeky, modern-day Dale Carnegie, Vanessa Van Edwards' innovative work has been featured on NPR, Business Week and CNN. And, her book, CAPTIVATE: The Science of Succeeding with People, is a literal roadmap to decode and, to a certain extent, influence human interaction.

We wanted to learn all about these things, the ideas, the ethics and application. But even more, we wanted to know what unfolded in Van Edward's life that led her to become so obsessed with the study of what makes us tick. Because, it turns out, Vanessa wasn't always the social savant in the room. In fact, in her earlier life, she pretty much ran from interaction.

So, what happened? The answer, and the stories that emerged, took us by surprise, and also revealed why this pursuit is so close to her heart.

Those were the options this week's guest,&nbsp;Ayelet Waldman, found herself facing.

A married mother of four and&nbsp;novelist living in Berkeley, Waldman struggled with bipolar, anxiety and depression her entire life. According to her, mental illness ran wide and deep in her family. Over the years, she'd found a pharmaceutical regime that made life tolerable, until peri-menopause destroyed her ability to time her medication and things spiraled rapidly out of control.

Waldman found herself increasingly mired in suicidal ideation. Nothing seemed to be working any more. Then, she heard about decades old research on psychedelics and a non-trippy therapeutic approach called microdosing.

Through a series of events, Ayelet found herself in possession of a vial of pure LSD and, seeing few others options, decided to try following a 30-day psychedelic microdosing protocol shared in James Fadiman's The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide.

Those 30-day changed everything. Within hours, the gray numbness began to lift. Life got more vivid, connected, stable and alive. Waldman wrote about her psychedelic microdosing journey, its affects, her fears and concerns, along with the politics, history, mythology and truths, how microdosing affected her work, mindset, relationship with her husband and kids and more in her latest book, A Really Good Day.

Head's up. This is a raw, unfiltered and provocative conversation. The bigger questions, issues and potential applications extend far beyond Waldman's immediate circumstances and life. This episode is neither an endorsement, nor an indictment of her choices or the use of psychedelics, but rather an exploration of deeply-challenging, yet critical issues from mental health to parenting and drug policy to science-fiction vs. fact.&nbsp;" class="description flexible-col"> <span><span class="episode-info"></span><span class="text">Suicide or psychedelics?

Born into an activist family in then apartheid South Africa, he was taught to always question norms and authority. This ethos followed him into his initial training as a doctor in South Africa. In his early work in a Soweto hospital, he was exposed to non-traditional healers who were able to accomplish what a more traditional approach to medicine struggled with.

He then emigrated&nbsp;to the United States in 1984, where he worked in the South Bronx, becoming Chief Medical Resident at Lincoln Hospital at the height of the crack epidemic. There, again, Lipman, began to see the limitations of traditional medicine in treating addiction, and embraced complimentary modalities. He deepened his study of&nbsp;nutrition, acupuncture, Chinese medicine, herbal medicine, functional medicine, biofeedback, meditation, and yoga and began to form a more integrated approach to the practice of medicine and wellbeing.

Frank eventually founded the Eleven Eleven Wellness Center in 1992, combining cutting-edge nutritional science with age-old healing techniques from the East. In a quest to bring this unique approach to the masses, he then founded&nbsp;BE WELL, based on the belief that everyone should have a fundamental right to be healthy.

Frank lives according to the philosophy of Ubuntu, a Xhosa word that serves as the spiritual foundation of African societies and articulates a basic understanding, caring, respect, and compassion for others. In his words, “what makes us human is the humanity we show each other.”

           <td role="gridcell" sort-value="Today’s guest,&nbsp;Dr. Aviva Romm, has been referred to as “the face of natural medicine in the 21st century by&nbsp;Prevention Magazine.”

She’s a Yale-trained, board-certified physician with a specialty in women’s health and obstetrics; a midwife and herbalist, and&nbsp;a founding member of the Yale Integrative Medicine Program’s Advisory Board.

Dr. Romm practices medicine in New York City and is a nationally sought speaker, author, and consultant. She is also one of the nation’s leaders in botanical medicine and is the author of 7 books on natural medicine.

In this week’s episode, we begin with her service-mission to Haiti after the earthquake, then find our way back to explore the key ideas from her groundbreaking new book,&nbsp;The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution.&nbsp;Aviva describes a pervasive yet often undiagnosed condition—Survival Overdrive Syndrome (SOS)—which leads to the feeling of being in perpetual survival mode, overcome by everything from fatigue, overwhelm and brain-fog to pain, disease and even death, when left unaddressed.

We also explore how so many of us push beyond what our physiological and psychological systems are adapted to be able to handle healthfully, all in the name of a success that ends up leaving us gutted and exhausted. Critically, she offers ways to identify the symptoms of SOS that can so quickly drain our Vitality Buckets and make our good life feel perpetually beyond reach.

And, we talk about the key steps to take to advocate for ourselves, find the right answers and people to help us, and also begin to walk the road back to health ourselves through a series of simple, yet proven lifestyle interventions. Her full recovery protocol is offered in an immensely “doable,” practical and powerful 4-week program in her book.

She is also one of the nation’s leaders in botanical medicine and is the author of 7 books on natural medicine. In this week’s episode, we begin with her service-mission to Haiti after the earthquake, then find our way back to explore the key ideas from her groundbreaking new book,&nbsp;The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution.&nbsp;Aviva describes a pervasive yet often undiagnosed condition—Survival Overdrive Syndrome (SOS)—which leads to the feeling of being in perpetual survival mode, overcome by everything from fatigue, overwhelm and brain-fog to pain, disease and even death, when left unaddressed. We also explore how so many of us push beyond what our physiological and psychological systems are adapted to be able to handle healthfully, all in the name of a success that ends up leaving us gutted and exhausted. Critically, she offers ways to identify the symptoms of SOS that can so quickly drain our Vitality Buckets and make our good life feel perpetually beyond reach. And, we talk about the key steps to take to advocate for ourselves, find the right answers and people to help us, and also begin to walk the road back to health ourselves through a series of simple, yet proven lifestyle interventions. Her full recovery protocol is offered in an immensely “doable,” practical and powerful 4-week program in her book.

All of this made us curious about a particular question…what made Tim Tim? Where does his lens on the world, on expertise, and on life come from? When did focus on process arise?

For Claire’s mother, Transcendental Meditation and the cloistered culture around it became a source of salvation and calm. But, over time, Claire began questioning the teachings and traditions. She eventually fled the town, the practice and community and moved back in with her father.

Decades later, a now established&nbsp;journalist and teacher and parent, and looking for answers, Claire found herself drawn back to Iowa, to reexamine her spiritual upbringing in an attempt to resolve unanswered questions rediscover a bit of lost magic.

           <td role="gridcell" sort-value="On September 17, 2009, Simon Sinek stepped onto a small stage for a local gathering...and proceeded to blow away the world.

The event was TEDx Puget Sound. He had no slides, no fancy presentation. Just an idea and an easel. For 18 minutes, he spoke about an awakening. Something he called &quot;the golden circle,&quot; and the need to know your &quot;why.&quot; The audience was captivated.

But that's just the beginning...

The event was filmed and posted to Youtube 11 days later. So powerful was Simon's presentation and idea that it was quickly pulled onto the main TED site. There it exploded into the world's consciousness, becoming one of the most-watched TED talks of all-time with nearly 30 million views.&nbsp;A book called Start With Why soon followed, becoming an instant hit.

Funny thing is, Simon doesn't really care about all of that. What he does care about is the Idea. The opportunity to inspire people to wake up to the possibility in their own lives. The ability to serve from a deeper, more humble yet powerful place. And to act.

Simon's transformative ideas continued to evolve with his&nbsp;book, Leaders Eat Last. This week's episode features a &quot;Best Of&quot; conversation with Simon, where we explore his remarkable journey, his extraordinary lens on the world (though he'll likely tell you it's anything but) and his deep desire both inspire and to serve those who serve others.

Simon is also a master storyteller. As our conversation unfolds, he shares a stunningly powerful story about a trip to Afghanistan with the military that went bad, and how it became a flight he'll remember for the rest of his life. By the time he was done, I was near tears and had trouble speaking, let alone continuing the conversation. Listen all the way through, it will be so worth the investment of time and energy.

Some quick quotes from the conversation:

&quot;Great leaders see money as fuel, not a destination.&quot;

&quot;Serve those who serve others.&quot;

&quot;Never sacrifice the people to save the numbers, sacrifice the numbers to save the people.&quot;

&quot;The responsibility of the leader is to look after the sons and the daughters of the parents who have given us their children to help us build our companies with the same love and tenderness and care that their parents gave to them.&quot;

We first aired this conversation in October 2013. I'm so excited to share this &quot;Best Of&quot; episode with you now." class="description flexible-col"> <span><span class="episode-info"></span><span class="text">On September 17, 2009, Simon Sinek stepped onto a small stage for a local gathering...and proceeded to blow away the world.

Millman was drawn into the world of news and print in her early twenties, cultivating an appetite for artful communication, storytelling and news.&nbsp;By her early thirties, though, life had dealt a series of challenges.

In quick succession, she found herself without a job or a sense of purpose, bound by her own self-loathing. Unlocking and even mining that negative cycle, though, was the key to her turnaround.

She started down a path of discovery that would lead to a series of serendipitous adventures, eventually becoming a leading voice in the world of design, branding and media, and co-founding and chairing the Masters in Branding Program at the School of Visual Arts in New York. She's also hosted the acclaimed Design Matters&nbsp;podcast for 11 years, which was a major inspiration for our show.

As Debbie shares in this conversation, you &quot;have to create your own happiness.&quot;

On this &quot;Best Of&quot; episode of Good Life Project, Debbie Millman gets real about living with uncertainty, creativity and freedom, diving into the world of design, art and media.

And, as we reflect on the year behind us, and think about the year to come, she reminds us to imagine immensities, then make them happen.

We first aired this conversation in April 2014.

Did Todd get an advanced degree? Nope. Did he write a bestselling book? Again, no. Was he hyper-connected to high-level gatekeepers and influencers? Not unless you consider horses and other farm animals to be conduits to greatness.

Then how did he end up the go-to person at the highest levels of sport and business? The answer lies in the same relentless drive that let him launch a packed consulting practice from a cold start by talking his way into speaking 68 times in 90 days.

Todd is one of the most focused and productive people we've ever met. He honed his skills over nearly two decades working with many of the top performing athletes in the world, before making a pretty radical shift to online education with the creation of his accelerated productivity training, The 90 Day Year.

In this week's conversation, we dive into his upbringing on a ranch in the middle of Canada, with thousands of acres to roam. We explore his jones to leave the ranch at a very early age and his more recent awakening to an unshakeable connection with the land. We talk about his lens on performance and deconstruct that whole 68 talks in 90 days strategy. We also talk about the interplay between elite performance, happiness, preparation and fulfillment.

In 2012, she left a successful career in advertising to launch her greeting card line, making cards for the relationships we actually have. Now a multimillion-dollar stationery and gift company, Emily McDowell Studio products are sold online and in nearly 2,000 stores worldwide.

In 2015, Emily’s Empathy Cards, designed to help people connect around serious illness and loss, struck a nerve around the world and gave people a way into conversations that seemed brutally hard to begin and deepen into.

Her first book, There Is No Good Card For This: What To Say and Do When Life Gets Scary, Awful, and Unfair To People You Love, will be released in January 2017.

In today's conversation, we take a step back in time, explore the experiences in her younger life that were defining moments, revealing who she really was and how Emily began to connect with an irreverent blend of art and humor that touches so many.

We explore what happened when she was diagnosed with cancer at a very young age and watched friends struggle to figure out how to be there for her. We dive into how she compartmentalized this experience, seeking to not let it define her, both as a person and, soon enough in art and business. We also track the launch and growth of her company and her recent move to rework the business in order to not just serve a &quot;customer&quot; need, but also give her what she needs, the ability to do the work that most lights her up.

He is author of The Journey Home, a memoir of his search for spiritual truth. His latest book is&nbsp;The Journey Within: Exploring the Path of Bhakti.&nbsp;

His teachings draw from the sacred texts of India such as&nbsp;The Bhagavad-gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, and Ramayana, and aim to reveal the practical application of the sacred traditions, while focusing on the shared essence which unites apparently disparate religious or spiritual paths.

Born Richard Slavin, on December 7, 1950, in his teens he came to confront a deep sense of alienation from suburban Chicago life and the civil injustices of mid-century America. At the age of nineteen, while on a summer trip to Europe, his internal struggles culminated in a commitment to search for God wherever it might lead him. Meditating on the Isle of Crete, he felt a supernatural calling and the next morning set off alone to find spiritual India.

The Journey Home documents his odyssey as a penniless hitch-hiker though Greece, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and finally India. There he lived as a wandering ascetic, first amongst the forest dwelling Himalayan yogis and later amongst a wide variety of gurus and spiritual practitioners throughout India and Nepal. Ultimately, he was led to the holy town of Vrindavan, where he found his path amongst the Bhakti-yogis.

In Vrindavan he found the teacher he was searching for in A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (1896-1977) the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), and representative of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, (the Krishna-bhakti tradition stemming from the 16th century mystic avatar Sri Chaitanya). In choosing Bhaktivedanta Swami, as his guru, Radhanath Swami felt compelled to shear his matted locks and reenter Western society with a mission to share the sacred wisdom he had received.

This return exemplifies the form of devotional yoga which is at the heart of Radhanath Swami’s teachings, a spiritual practice expressed as tangible action meant to bring about personal fulfillment and benefit the world. At the the age of 31 he took the monastic vows of a Vaishnava sanyassin and became known as Radhanath Swami.

Today Radhanath Swami travels regularly throughout India, Europe and North America, sharing the teachings of Bhakti-yoga. He resides much of the year at the Radha Gopinath Ashram in Chowpatty, Mumbai. For the past twenty-five years he has guided the community’s development and has directed a number of acclaimed social action projects including Midday Meals, which daily serves more than 260,000 plates of sanctified vegetarian food to the children of the slums of Mumbai. He has also worked to establish missionary hospitals and eye camps, eco-friendly farms, schools and ashrams, an orphanage, and a number of emergency relief programs throughout India." class="description flexible-col"> <span><span class="episode-info"></span><span class="text">Today's guest is Radhanath Swami, a Vaishnava sanyassin (a monk in a Krishna-bhakti&nbsp;lineage) and teacher of the devotional path of Bhakti-yoga.

Orly began her career as a middle school teacher, empowering children to embrace unity, build self-value, and use their power to influence the world for good. Trying to reckon with the death of two kids in her school, and guide her students through it in 2011, Orly founded Life Vest Inside (LVI), a non-profit organization with a mission to empower and unite the world with kindness.

Through LVI, Wahba encourages people to embrace the incredible power of giving and recognize that in times of hardship, kindness, like a life vest, keeps the world afloat. LVI gained international acclaim when Orly’s award-winning film,&nbsp;Kindness Boomerang, went viral, receiving over 100 million views and eventually landing her a spot to speak at TED2013 on the magic of kindness.

OWe got curious about where Wahba's unrelenting devotion to kindness and respect came from. What were the foundational experiences and stories, the moments of both struggle and revelation? How to did she write, film and produce her Kindness Boomerang video on her own, and why does she believe it resonated so widely?

Turns out, Orly's earlier life was filled with polar opposites, deep familial love, and also profound social isolation and loss. This led to a years-long spiral after a fire in her childhood home splintered the family into different locations. Emerging from this dark window, she felt compelled to help others, especially kids, experience the world from a place of acceptance and generosity. We go deep into this journey in today's episode.

Orly's forthcoming book, Kindness Boomerang, is available for pre-order now. As Orly's global community grows by the thousands, more people are experiencing the grace and connection of kindness with activities, events and more. Their 5th annual Dance for Kindness Worldwide Flashmob is happening November 13, so you still have time to get involved!

Desai's connection to spirit, to something bigger than him or any one being, arrived as a child. Embracing it and allowing it to move through him came easily. But,&nbsp;because it also came so early in life, he'd not yet developed the seasoning to be able to understand and apply this wisdom in the most constructive way.

It would take years of grappling, growing and even stumbling, often in the public's eye, to begin to forge a deeper wisdom and a more capable channel that would allow him to fully step into, understand and share his gift.

TThe catalyst for this rapid evolution, though, would be something Panache Desai never saw coming, his daughter's devastating diagnosis of heart failure. Hours after we spoke with Panache, he would be on a plane to the hospital to join his wife and daughter, who had just been placed on a list for a heart-transplant.

He was in a process of reckoning. This is where our conversation began. We dropped into the deep end of the pool very quickly and never really came out. The conversation was powerful, emotional and it will challenge your idea of meaning and connection and remind you of the importance of staying open, leading with love, being forever a student and owning our impact on those around us. We wish Panache and his family love and healing, grace and ease.

Get your free guided meditation from Panache to change the energy that surrounds you and access the greatness that has always lived inside you.

Today, I sit down with Glennon the morning after she's wrapped one of her gathering at the legendary BAM (Brooklyn Academy of Music) in New York City, where she was joined by a multi-denominational collective on-stage, including Alicia Keys who was so moved she couldn't help but belt out an impromptu song before leaving.

In this conversation, we dip into her new memoir. But that's more of a jumping off point that leads us into some very different waters, from leading as an introvert, her feelings about faith and how it informs what she's creating to how she's moving into a season of her life where the line between public and private, art and service, love and leading is shifting in profound and intentional ways.

We go deep into some provocative territory here, and there are more than a few invitations to reconsider how you move into the world and what you choose to focus on. Agree or not, this is a conversation that'll leave you lifted, challenge your assumptions and also make you think and feel.

That's the story in today's episode of Good Life Project, featuring Lori Harder. Growing up in Michigan, Lori found herself increasingly anxious about more and more things, from the size of her body to her ability to fit in. Not surprising for a young teen. But, add to that being born into a faith with an ethos of separation from outsiders, and you've got a perfect recipe for amplified struggle.

In her early teens, though, something changed that began to bring Harder out of her shell. And, that was just the beginning. She eventually transformed herself into not just a fit and confident woman, but a cover model and an advocate not just for fitness, but for a more complete approach to wellbeing. She now teaches and speaks on this in her workshops and keynotes and retreats.

As she writes in her manifesto, &quot;Beauty is a way of being.&nbsp;Strength means showing up.&nbsp;Fierce self-love is our only choice.&quot;

It's about coaching.

But, he's not just talking about coaches, he's talking about every person who finds themselves in regularly helping others move forward, from parents to friends to colleagues and, yes, actual coaches.

In his latest book,&nbsp;The Coaching Habit,&nbsp;he makes a bold proclamation, maybe it's time to spend less time talking and more time listening and asking the 7 simple questions that'll unlock a stunning amount of connection, revelation and elevation.

But, here's the thing, Michael and Jonathan are old friends, so it takes them a while to get to these ideas. Along the way, they dive deep into Michael's personal journey, the wacky world of self-help/personal-development, and Michael shares a &quot;technology&quot; that incites accelerated growth and change that's remarkably powerful and has used and validated in giant organizations.

 In This Episode, You'll Learn:5 unspeakable truths about coaching.The 7 questions that change everything.How we live a good life, show up and do meaningful work, and transcend the self-help yadda yadda.Two types of envy and how to use the good type as motivation.How to get clear on the question – 'What do you want?'When to fire cannon balls and when to fire bullets.What the boldest coaching question&nbsp;is that a coach can ever ask.

The issues were raw and real, the ideas were rich and his lens was so contrarian and refreshing it made me think. Really think. But, then, there was the language. This particular essay was wall-to-wall F-bombs.

I was having trouble reconciling the depth of thought with the width of profanity. I found myself diving into more of his work, and discovered that I wasn't the only one. Some 2 million people read him every month. Waiting for his next philosophical provocation.

When I heard Mark had a new book out, I figured it was the perfect opportunity to sit down with him and dive into his bigger story. To get to know the person behind the writing. In this week's conversation, Mark and I take a meandering road through everything from global travel and which country emotes more than others to a more nuanced conversation of pain, possibility, writing and exactly how, when and why he began to insert profanity into his work, what it's done both for and to him.

His latest book is&nbsp;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living A Good Life. As you might guess from the title, the first few chapters are a pretty in-your-face setup, but as the book continues, Manson settles into a deeper, you might even say gentler voice. He explores ideas like choosing the pain you want to live with, rather than the outcome you want to attain.&nbsp;Just like his essay before, it made me think. I hope it'll do the same for you.

First up, Elizabeth Gilbert. Gilbert exploded into the public's consciousness in 2006 with the release of her mega-bestselling memoir, Eat Pray Love.

Since then, she's published a series of books, given a TED talk on creative genius that's been viewed more than 10 million times, become&nbsp;a leading voice on the pursuit of a creative, connected and vital life.

GIlbert's latest book, Big Magic, takes you deeper into what it means to live a creative life, offering a wonderful blend of wisdom, unabashed magical thinking, amazing stories and a whole lot of unexpected myth-busting and contrarian insights.

I had a chance to sit down with Liz and, as often happens with these Good Life conversations, we ended up going all sorts of places I'd never planned. We touched on the power of curiosity and the fallacy of passion, where creativity comes from, what stops us from doing the thing we're here to do, the importance of caring for your vessel, what happens when you think you've reached the end of your capacity and her powerful lens on what it means to life a good life.

This is deeply moving, revealing, insightful and sometimes pretty funny conversation. In fact, we begin with a hard-hitting reveal of a relationship that Gilbert had kept secret for more than four decades. And, along the way, this beautiful thought came tumbling forth:

&quot;When you come to the end of yourself is where all the interesting stuff starts.&quot; Tweet this.

If you've ever wondered how to step into a creative life, how to get that thing in your head and heart out into the world, this is an absolute &quot;do not miss&quot; conversation.

We first aired this conversation in September 2015. I'm so excited to share this &quot;Best Of&quot; episode with you now." class="description flexible-col"> <span><span class="episode-info"></span><span class="text">As we move into these final weeks of August, we'll be airing two extraordinary "Best Of" episodes, featuring powerful conversations from the last year.

Born and raised in Dublin, Ireland, David, like so man of us, had a deep fear of public speaking. But, he found himself having to face this head on, when he&nbsp;reluctantly agreed to host a benefit comedy show he had suggested for a friend, Arash Bayatmakou, who had suffered a severe spinal cord injury (Comedy for a Spinal Cause). He quickly realized the best speakers were also often the funniest. Not because of the one-liners they threw into the audience, but because they knew how to tell a story in a way that made people laugh.

In at attempt to learn the craft and also face his crippling fear of public speaking, he spent a year traveling the country pretending to be an accomplished comedian and talking his way onto as many comedy show stages and festivals as possible. Along the way, he not only overcame his fear of speaking, he began to deconstruct the best story-driven comedy and figured out a methodology he could not only bring to the stage himself, but also teach pretty much anyone. Even people who consider themselves to have nearly zero ability to tell stories or be funny.

The shared this approach in a book,&nbsp;k, Do You Talk Funny?,&nbsp;then launched&nbsp;a community, writers platform, and conference series under called&nbsp;FunnyBizz Conference: Where Business Meets Humor,&nbsp;with the intention of helping everyone from speakers and executives to content creators tap the power of storytelling, comedy and improv to engage readers and audiences on a whole new level.

David realized he had learned something in the process that could be valuable to other businesspeople — most people, with the right techniques, could learn to be funny, (at least on stage) and learning how to structure a comedy routine involves the exact same skills as making a successful presentation.&nbsp;He now also runs an agency that lets anyone from executives to speakers to anyone who wants funnier content tap a team of freelance comedy writers to punch up anything from a keynote or best-man's speech to an article or boardroom presentation.

In This Episode, You'll Learn:What it was like faking his way onto stagesHow his Irish heritage played into his ability to tell storiesWhich TED talks have the most laughs per minute.How comedy &amp; copywriting are correlated.That US comedy is a testament to tight TV ready writing.How many laughs per day a baby has compared to adults over 35 years old.That CEOs perceive people with a sense of humor as doing better work.

           <td role="gridcell" sort-value="Today's guest is obsessed with wonder. In fact, it's his vocation.

Jeffery Davis is the&nbsp;founder of Tracking Wonder, where he explores how to reconnect with wonder and also help people tell their their stories through books, businesses and beyond.

As a kid, he became concerned about paying attention to life and ensuring that he'd never lose his imagination. That led him to become a poet, a teacher, an author and then...everything fell apart.

He realized he'd been living entirely &quot;from the neck up,&quot; largely disembodied and disconnected from his heart. That awakening launched a years-long quest to rediscover a deeper, more soulful driver. It brought him back to wonder as a driving force in his life and eventually as his career.

He has taught his signature approaches to creativity, writing, and branding at numerous universities, conferences, and centers around the world. An author, speaker, and online columnist for Psychology Today, he is in dogged pursuit of what helps creatives thrive amidst constant challenge and change. He lives in a farmhouse in the Hudson Valley with his wife and two girls.

Maybe his biggest true driver, though, is to be the kind of adult whose life reveals to his daughters the grace and beauty and joy of a wonder that never ends.

His new book of poetry is&nbsp;Coat Thief.

In This Episode You’ll Learn:The gift that his father gave him, passed down from his grandfather.How he ended up living with his bachelor&nbsp;father during high school.How he faked being an extrovert growing up.Why his friends called him 'The Mystery Man'.His decision between joining the monastery or becoming a poet.The entry point that broke him out of his intellect and into his body.The two-fold silent promise he made to his baby girl after she was born.

He teaches courses on organizational behavior, creativity and innovation, and strategic leadership and has made&nbsp;it his purpose to facilitate the transfer of good ideas.

 THe is the author The Myths of Creativity: The Truth About How Innovative Companies Generate Great Ideas&nbsp;and writes&nbsp;regularly for Harvard Business Review, Forbes, PsychologyToday and 99U. He's&nbsp;also the founder and host of Radio Free Leader, a podcast that shares insights on leadership, innovation, and strategy.

His new book,&nbsp;Under New Management: How Leading Organizations Are Upending Business as Usual, draws&nbsp;on decades of research&nbsp;which&nbsp;has found that not only are many of our fundamental management practices wrong and misguided, but they can be downright counter-productive.

They're also the co-authors the new book&nbsp;Simple Green Smoothies: 100+ Tasty Recipes to Lose Weight, Gain Energy, and Feel Great in Your Body.

Just a few years ago, though, they were two young moms, struggling mightily to get by, on every level.

Money was tight, they both &quot;had&quot; to work to help support their families. Jadah was acting in educational plays for schools and Jen was doing design work. But it just wasn't enough.

Neither found any sense of deeper purpose or sustainable income in what they were doing, so they began to hatch a plan to work together to create a community for moms.

They spent every extra minute trying to build an education website and community, but it just wasn't working. At the same time, Jadah was trying to figure out how to reclaim her health, but as a young mom, she wanted something fast and easy to start. So, she began making one simple green smoothie a day.

That one act changed her health and her life, fueling the loss of more than 25 pounds and giving her tons of energy. And, it became the trigger for a much bigger change. Wanting to share this simple solution with other moms, Jen and Jadah&nbsp;created an instagram account, named it Simple Green Smoothies, and began to create smoothie recipes and share them. The account exploded. People loved their images, detailed recipes and generosity. As I write this, 382,000 people follow the account.

Over the next few years, Jen and Jadah parlayed that one instagram account into a massively popular Simple Green Smoothies website, a global community that has now seen hundreds of thousands of&nbsp;people go through their 30-day challenge and now a new book.

They've also built a powerhouse business fueled by health and love and become successful enough to become the main financial supporters of their families. Most important, they love working together, they love what they do and they have a fierce commitment to building their company and community from a place of love.
