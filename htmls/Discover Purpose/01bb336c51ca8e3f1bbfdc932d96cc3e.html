           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Forewarning – I don’t know what an introductory paragraph is. My topic sentence is never in the proper place; I ramble on way, way too much; my fondness of fragments needs to go. Oh really, Professor? Well I think that my explication of Keats’ “Ode on a Grecian Urn” was just fine. My comments on Dunne’s “The Canonization” right on. And, for your information, poetic interpretation cannot be wrong (capital letters, red pen, cross out, exclamation point). Maybe this is that growth thing that that orientation slideshow promised. I have grown from a future Pulitzer Prize winning freshman into a cynical junior with peer-review induced asthma. Thanks for sending me here Mom and Dad!</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Really, I am not all that cynical. I still believe that college is the place for the mind to expand and thoughts to be free, as long as your mind never enters the box and your thoughts are anti-government, anti-war, anti-leg shaving, anti-everything. Going against the grain? There’s probably a club for that – try GAG, in Arabic letters (the English language being so démodé and all). Rebel against the man, down with Big Brother, impeach W, or else be radical. Want to really be different? Support something other than a non-profit. Speak out for the death penalty. Admit you have no urge to visit Africa. Reveal that you voted for Bush and, gasp, still support him. College is the place to transform ideas into reality, if only the damn government wasn’t policing everyone’s ideas.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Still believe that the professor is on the side of the student. Your success is his ultimate goal. Got a 25% on your midterm? Put that dirty razor blade down. Congratulations! You’re in the top ten percent of the class! It doesn’t matter that you knew less than ¼ of the information (“Answer True/False” might as well have said “Find G-d and Take a Shot”), it’s the Ivies, our curve is always bell shaped, our mean is always a B. What you learned isn’t important – it’s your grade that counts! Want to come to office hours? No need for an appointment, that’s way too impersonal and rigid. Just show up and wait in line. Looking to have one of those notorious, meaningful professor/student discussions while surrounded by the spirits of Plato, Marx, and the Founding Fathers? Grab a cup of coffee, pull up a seat, there are hours of chatting to be had – read and analyze in depth praise over the professor’s latest novel, delve into the intricacies of the complicated debate over which of his awards is most prestigious, break down, moment by moment, the exact steps taken on his journey to the discovery of fire. When you’re with the world’s most intelligent man, the conversation just flows!</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I still believe in the unrivaled usefulness of a personal advisor. All I need to do is peruse the forty-nine page course catalog, decipher departmental codes, choose classes that I am eligible for, figure out non-overlapping time slots, register for limited enrollment, decide on a major, calculate the next four years of my life, make sure I fulfill every requirement, submit approved forms to the registrar, and deliver him a 3 x 5 that says “initial here” – during finals week. He, on the other hand, handles the tough stuff – disappears from his office when his presence is guaranteed, grimaces when I chase him down on his way to the bathroom, moves his hand all the way up to his chest pocket, removes a pen, clicks the top, and signs his full name, first and last! All the while maintaining the memory of a Ginkgo Biloba poster boy – I have only had to introduce myself to him once, at every appointment. I smell a scholarship with somebody’s name on it…</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I still believe that if I have a problem, my Dean is there to help. Concerned I won’t complete my requirements in four years? Slow down! Unsure if I’m taking enough credits? I’m too hard on myself! Don’t worry; she’s already laid out a five year plan for me, with an extra summer semester if I need it. Take it easy, relax, graduation is the ultimate goal. For only another 40 thousand dollars, I can trade in four years of stress induced headaches for five of waking up at noon, Monday through Thursday. Don’t be so mechanical! Take an ancient Indian dance course, learn how to operate a pottery wheel, enroll in poetry for the deaf – sign up for something enjoyable. No papers, no exams, no problem. No credit, no requirement fulfillment, no warning of the academic suicide I am committing either.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I still believe that college is preparation for the real world. What high school student has the skill to study for five exams, each three hours long and worth 40% of a course grade, held within four days – and not turn to Coke? Could a seventeen year old layout her next few years, keeping core/major/minor/concentration requirements in mind, by the day of the registration deadline, which coincidentally happens to be smack in the middle of the second hour of her third test? Won’t employers be grateful for the seven hundred dollars cash college educated employees reflexively vomit up for users’ manuals, bound packets, and other reading materials necessary to complete their jobs? Business 101 stumper – How to make the most amount of money in the shortest amount of time. Easy, I learned that in college- charge for everything! The future of workplace productivity is bright.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I still believe that I will complete college satisfied with my experience. My diploma will bring a certain maturity to my childhood bedroom/my sister’s kids’ nursery in my parents’ home, which I will inevitably be moving back into. Only a few more years, a little more money (Dad?), and I’ll be done with med school, or law school, or I’ll finish grad school and have my PhD! I’ll be on my way to an entry level position that may or may not eventually lead to the job I’ve always dreamed of! I will be a college graduate – now that’s something that stands out on a resume!</p>

            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I woke up this morning, poured myself a bowl of Grape-Nuts, and sat down in front of my computer to watch a video over the Internet of an Iranian woman being stoned to death. I was a bit queasy, a bit unsettled, but certainly engaged by the footage. I could have just as easily read up on the footage at any number of news websites, human rights blogs, news channels with multiple shows and personalities – or I could have passed a glance at a headline in a newspaper: “IRANIAN WOMAN STONED WITHOUT REMORSE.” The event is not particularly news to me. Not in the sense that I have come to expect it (a sensibility I would have indeed come to have exercised, given a literally never-ending deluge of information about such events), but rather in that it has simply lost its interest, its engagement, its flash of relevance in my significantly less afflicting life. I realize now that I have been desensitized to the rapid flow of information not because of the content itself, but because of its close-wed relationship to the laurels upon which the college generation of the Vietnam-era America had established for the future of academia, and it is here as a college student that I can attest to the change of college as I envisioned it in America’s fabric to the lived reality of it. Rick Perlstein writes in What’s the Matter With College? that College has fallen in strength due to the apathy felt among students towards the very distinct changes from high school and post college life, viewing it with an obfuscated sense of their lives’ great times. College is supposed to be the springtime of one’s life; a season that has been muddled into a haze by Perlstein’s account, citing the many students who have come to resent their collegiate experience. The article does justice to the one socially relevant concern – “What happened to College?” – to me and my have been wondering, as well as exposing the large rift between the Vietnam- and Iraq-era concepts of College. Information and its rapid flow – often considered to be one of the defining characteristics of this generation – have served to inform a surge of people in the world to come to maintain keen awareness of its vitality and importance in their lives – or they could maintain a keen façade. The progressive template of the students of the 60’s and 70’s has come to feel to large to the students of the yet unnamed00’s (yet unnamed, appropriately enough) due in large part to this desensitization to information and, tragically enough, the most prevalent of indicators for the generation to come. The loss of bona fide Collegiate intrigue is found in the advent of Internet 2.0 and the role of global events and current activity in forming the character of the current College generation.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Internet has done a fine job of filling the world with information, networking, and other tools for the ever-complex world, but has also upset the balance between computerized communication and human communication. No matter how advanced or far-reaching online social networking becomes, “:)” will never replace a friend’s smile, nor will the inevitable sense of impersonal distance that stems from it. MySpace and Facebook have performed miracles in connecting people over the Internet: I was able to rediscover a friend who I thought was lost in the tsunami disaster of Indonesia, with the Internet fulfilling its promise as the most human technology to date. But I also sense that, while the Internet is entitled to a proper place in everyday communication, it has been too hastily integrated as the most apropos form of communication. Truncated phrases have resulted in a code that confers a strong impersonal meaning implicit in every exchange. And it really is this literal “impersonality” that has been imparted into many aspects of modern life, often recognized under the misnomer of “efficiency” or “hi-tech.” The same problem exists with Wikipedia. It is easily the finest encyclopedia ever assembled as well as one of the Internet’s crowning achievements – the information of everything in the known world facilitated and categorized to near perfection – but it has also altered the manner in which information is gained for the worse. With such an incredible academic powerhouse available, the desire and commitment necessary to achieve this information without using it has dampened, deadened, and (in my experiences) has ceased to exist. Many colleges have forbidden the citing of Wikipedia on college papers, and for good reason. Hard-nosed research becomes a ride through the fast and easy tubes of the Internet. What could have been a night of marathon research at library has become a night of Seinfeld and cursory browsing. Granted, these changes do not necessarily mean that the college student of today is a solely a sedentary slob who can accomplish nearly any task form the dorm room. But they do mark a change in the complexion of the intellect of the student, from holding genuine desire for and pursuance of knowledge to a more lackadaisical stance. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The change between the generations of college students is best assessed by considering the differences between the two major wars that were occurring at each time and, from there, gauging the level of protest in each era. The Vietnam-era college generation had a right to be vehement: the Vietnam War was a draft war, a costly and embarrassing war, and it perfect platform for the youth of America to lash out against the government. All of academia presenting a unified front against war, deceit, and every other malady of the world? Perfect! College would become the most optimistic institution available in American society: as the government would forever be perceived as crooked, the University would be forever youthful and would exist to keep their government in check. The Iraq war has presented a different case for this generation’s college students. Students are used to being expected to rebel and to protest and to question everything that comes into their field of view. Perhaps it is here that the students in Perlstein’s article have formed their “infantilizing” exchanges with the American college system. They feel that they’ve been bred to question and have been condition to view everything relevant to them and their future under close scrutiny. The apparent apathy seen is not necessarily the desire not to have to protest, but the desire to come into college without being expected to uphold the intellectual groundwork of their predecessors. College as public sphere for the development of intellect has waned over time, rather taking on the more mundane role as another yet-unremarkable phase of schooling. The “protest,” the vivifying source of power for Vietnam-era college students, has been lost without a strong point of relativity to engender and promote it. College students have always been in opposition of war, but today’s students are not likely to seem as empowered by their goals simply because they know the government (read: Bush) will not listen them and will favor their own cryptic agendas. The level of protest forms the backbone of the collegiate experience; now, more than ever, will protest define the college student.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My class, the class of 2007, just finished college. Not the college that ends with a simple bachelor’s degree, a pat on the back, and a lifetime subscription to your alumni magazine. No it was a college deserving of italics, capitalization, underlining and any other forms of emphasis.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Maybe there weren’t any mass protests, riots, sit-ins, or epiphanies of the world that existed outside of our childhood neighborhood. It is true that we probably received a glimpse of what was out there from high school due to the Internet and television. Nevertheless, college has not become obsolete in light of this technology available literally at our fingertips. On the contrary, these media have helped us reach deeper during college by exposing us earlier to the realities of the world outside of our childhood, unlike the experience described by Doug Mitchell.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Seemingly unending war, distrust of the government and its officials, and a changing world is certainly not exclusive to the college experience of our parents. Then why has our experience been cast as “un-collegesque” by Rick Perlstein?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Since the 1970s, the absence of a draft, the eligibility to vote over the age of 18, and the use of social networking sites on the Internet allows the college experience to be channeled through different avenues and media. Today college students can show their support, and enthusiasm, for certain causes in ways that do not seem as loud and vocal to command a front-page story. Certainly the news of young civil rights workers murdered for their activism and the images of Kent State undergrads being shot on campus were deserving of the reporting of movements by students on and off college campuses during the 60s and 70s, thus placing them in the spotlight.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Today students have the choice to enlist in the military and who they can elect to government with their right to vote provided by the 26th Amendment, choices that the students of the 60s did not have. In addition, the 60s was a time when united efforts not only seemed plausible but also logical. While not always smooth, different movements and groups combined efforts in fighting for their cause by arguing their common interests. Today, the Internet is helping unite young people who had never met anyone with their interest in their area to people and places that share the same eagerness. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With all this connectivity, the Internet should make the process easier to fight for common causes. Nevertheless, the Internet has probably created a plethora of causes in the world today, which has made it harder to tie in everyone’s efforts with the other in order to provide a louder voice for their cause. In effect, it is harder for everyone, or at least an overwhelming and obvious majority, to be involved with every cause. While diluting the collective voice of college students, the Internet has provided opportunities for students to hone in on their interests during college. This occurs with activities either on campus, such as those Caroline Ouwerkerk, the so-called “organization kid,” is involved with, or off campus in internships with non-profit organizations which students might had never heard of before.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">While this might be true, dilution is no excuse for the poor turnout at the voting booth by young people. No one can argue with this point. Students of the 60s certainly have the right to complain about our generation’s lack of voting despite their efforts to gain this privilege for my generation; a right that, unfortunately, only few people in this world have had. Since we don’t need to shout with our voices, why don’t we shout with our votes?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The lack of voting should not be interpreted as lack of dialogue and interest in current events. The heated debates that Mr. Perlstein writes about still occur. Everywhere from the classroom to the recitation hall and from the dorm to even my fraternity house at the University of Pennsylvania was filled with debate about all the relevant topics of the day and all discussions eventually led up to them. It’s true that maybe this is a unique characteristic that exists only at my school, but from my visits and discussions with high school friends at other schools across the country I feel strongly that Penn was not an exception.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With all this dialogue, online and offline activism, and the growing passion for non-profit work by college students, why are the voting percentages still comparatively low compared with the passion of college students? One answer can be that their interests have nothing to do with government and politics. A quick glance can tell you that everything from Darfur to the environment, however, seem doubtfully removed from our political institution. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I served as an elected Judge of Election for the City of Philadelphia Board of Elections for the previous two years. It is something that I am sure few young people have done and it is a shame because working as a judge on election day truly gets you involved in the non-partisan process that so many people speak of in my generation. From my experience I can report to you a detailed account on what is wrong with elections and how that affects voting particularly among students, but I can tell you that Penn has instituted efforts that have increased on campus voter turnout by over 200% in every election since the November 2004 election. Peer organizations, especially non-partisan groups such as Penn Leads the Vote, and student workers at voting booths on campus help students realize that others care about voting as much as they do and they should express it together. It just might be the only common interest that is left.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Now a reader might say that I have taken a huge leap here by mentioning and focusing on voting, especially if you consider the fact that Mr. Perlstein never mentions voting in his article. I think that is the core problem with Mr. Perlstein’s article. The fact is that the times we saw in the 60s and 70s cannot occur anymore because of the world young people live in now as described above. The boisterous students of the 60s could have gotten away with not voting and still remain a central component of political and social debate. The only thing they had were protests and words of exchange.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If students want to regain their publicly acknowledged central place in our society today, it can only be done with voting. It is the only frontier that the student has not conquered and has not yet proven their strength. While peer outreach helps, the voluntary, or involuntary, omission by the older generation of the real, and not just the cliché, importance of voting disillusions young people that voting doesn’t matter.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The fact is that college is still college. The problem is not that the college experience is less critical to the nation, but that America does not see it anymore and voting will help restore the college campus back to its central place in American society.</p>

            <address class="byline author vcard"></address> 
           </header> 
           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We all know that history is cyclical. We study the past in order to better equip ourselves for the future. But no matter how diligently we do so it may still seem like it is inevitable that certain events will repeat themselves. The Holocaust was the worst display of genocide the world had ever witnessed. So we commemorate and memorialize, but still, genocide strikes in the 1990s in Rwanda and as we speak it continues to devastate the African continent in region of Darfur. Does this mean our efforts are entirely futile? I certainly would not like to believe so. Instead, looking from a different perspective we can begin to recognize that the youth of each generation must make a conscious decision to observe or react to the events that occur during the times in which they live. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Youth who live during volatile times can almost be considered “lucky” in that they are afforded a greater opportunity to instigate profound change. When opportunities (like Vietnam and Iraq) do not arise, individuals tend to remain stagnant. Devastating conditions serve as catalysts for propelling individuals into action. Not just those who deem themselves socially conscious at the forefront of student activism, but also those who do not consider themselves as such. And this is the crucial element that determines if a generation will be remembered as influential: when being proactive about influencing the nation becomes mainstream, “cool,” “hip,” and dare I say “groovy” all at once. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The baby- boomers were afforded the opportunity to influence the course its nation would take. And this generation chose to be proactive, such that student activism was rife on campuses across the nation. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Times have certainly changed over the past four decades, and college campuses today are by no means identical to what they were in the past. The college experience as society understands it is not the same today. Although the role college plays in society has changed, the impact college students can have on their society has by no means diminished. Instead, the youth of today’s generation face new challenges as well as new resources to influence society at their disposal. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> The value of a general college degree has diminished in recent decades. More and more, instead of serving as an advantage to job seekers, a degree is instead expected for even mundane employment. While some form of higher education is increasingly more essential to secure a job, the cost of such an education is exponentially growing. According to a US News report in late 2006, the average student today will pay approximately $115,000 for their degree, while thirty years ago the total cost was about $12,000. The tremendously growing cost and competitiveness for a degree have certainly changed the face of college campuses today. In the past, college may have served as a retreat for burgeoning and passionate intellects, an escape from the real world. Yet today, many equally passionate young intellects incur such an enormous amount of debt that they literally cannot afford to take a break from the real world during their 4 (or more) years of higher education because they must prepare themselves as much as possible in order to secure a financially stable position upon graduation. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The line differentiating college students from the rest of society and the working world has seemingly begun to blur. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Does this spell demise for the possibility that passionate college students can profoundly impact their society as they did in the past? I do not think so. Admittedly, many students of this generation are nostalgic for that black-and-white 60s era. The 60s counterculture also offers immense appeal- posters of Jimi Hendrix and Che Guevara undoubtedly continue to grace the walls of many a college dorm. Yet the fact remains that we exhibit nostalgia towards something we’ve never truly experienced. Because we don’t have a first-hand account of what college in the 60s was like, we can easily fall victim to a romanticized version of the era. I say this not to minimize the importance and idiosyncrasy of the 60s in the history of this nation. Yet we must step back to survey our current situation.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Certainly, the civil rights, antiwar, and feminism movements have made their mark in history books and deserve to be remembered for their respectable achievements. Yet despite the enormous strides made by the vigorous youth of the sixties, these facts still remain: racism has not been eradicated, sexism is alive, injustice still pervades society and war is still a gruesome, undeniable reality. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yet student idealism is also still alive and well, for with the continuation of such challenges comes a renewed opportunity for change. New challenges have also begun to rear their heads in the face of today’s generation. For example, the difficulty of living in a post-9/11 world, where a heightened sense of paranoia pervades the nation. Or the continuing progression of global warming and environmental degradation, where a threat that once seemed as distance as the first ice age has now become an undeniable reality. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Students of today can easily survey the condition of their world recognize that certain things are in dire need of change. But just as times have changed since the 60s, so have the resources available for young and passionate individuals who want to have an impact. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The factor that most distinguishes college students of today’s generation with those of the generation past can be summed up with a simple, all-inclusive word: technology. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is no doubt true that the technology is not always used for the most productive reasons. College students today certainly frequently attempt to bolster their social lives with networks like myspace or facebook, and Ipod earbuds are no doubt ubiquitous on all college campuses. Yet despite the myriad temptations technology may present, it also undeniably presents this generation with an incredible host of unprecedented avenues for change. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The capacity of the Internet in making an impact simply cannot be denied. Consider the innovation of CNN YouTube Debates, where anyone with internet and a web camera can record a question directed to presidential candidates. Or how easy it is today for a student to enlist individuals to donate to noble causes or sign mass petitions expressing their disdain to policymakers. Or even how that beloved online social network, Facebook, can be used to publicize for campus events concerning genocide, poverty, or human rights.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I believe the enormous possibilities to instigate change that technology grants to this generation are one powerful reason why we should have hope that college students can still change the world. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">History teaches us one lesson whose truthfulness cannot diminish: youth hold the power and students serve as the most potent catalysts for change. Revolution and reform are not born out of the minds of the aged who have adjusted to the status quo, but out of those minds who are daring enough to question the state of matters. Students today must make a conscious decision to prove they can still have an enormous impact on their world, just as their predecessors. And so, history will surely repeat.</p>

But the answers themselves are no laughing matter. We all have our preconceptions about higher education, but can you believe that I know the truth of the matter? Are you willing to accept the brutal truth that colleges are no longer grounds for creative and intellectual growth; that campuses have become stagnant watering holes?! Outrageous you say? No, no, it’s true! You can trust me; after all, I am one of today’s – college students – . I might even work at the college bookstore, or was it the library? Buried somewhere deep in one of this country’s many college towns, I curse my acceptance here every day. And yet I stay. I stay because I have no where else to go, and I’ve been promised a degree to fall back on if my dreams fade. Dreams?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yes, I know such a term isn’t widely used anymore. Dreams certainly aren’t encouraged in colleges today; after all, they don’t fit into the confines of a “major.” And they rarely make money – Oh, how important money seems to be to colleges today … You know, I once told a professor about my dreams; he took a call before I could finish. I know I’m not alone in this; in these thoughts, these howls. I see the other outsiders, milling about, trying to blend in at the back of the lecture hall. They’re easy to spot by the color of their cowboy boots, by the length of their teeth, by the look in their eyes. But there aren’t enough of us, only handfuls, and we don’t even have draft cards to burn…</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Being critical to a situation guarantees nothing in the realm of positives and negatives; it only assures influence. Is the college experience less critical to the nation today than it was a generation ago? It’s Critical as ever! The experience gained through college by my generation will serve as the foundation of America for the next 40 years, and it is by this shoddy groundwork that America will continue to crumble. Right now the number of students enrolled in higher education is immense; after all, a college degree is essential for today’s youth to achieve the goals set for them by Mom and Dad and God and Country. – Not going to college? Well, that’s just not acceptable. Anybody whose anybody goes to college these days, don’t you know that? – We are being pumped through this college system, to obtain the college experience. Ah-Ha! There it is again, the “experience.” Well I’m sorry to break it to you, because I wish it weren’t true, but this is the con, ladies and gentlemen; the essential flaw.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There is no experience in college Yes, you read right! Students across the country are finding out much they can drink, and how to calculate gross domestic product, but we aren’t learning the skills or morals to live a full life. The college experience is no longer distinctive; today it comes preassembled, straight from the cookie cutter, with a fancy package and signed certificate of completion. That is what’s being paid for, don’t chya see? And despite this, college enrollment is the highest it has ever been; nearly the entire body of this generation is sweating it out in dorm rooms all around the country, watching the same television shows, buying the same posters even! “But what has changed?” you ask. The American College has become commodified; the journey is no longer unique. What were once establishments of knowledge are now establishments of business. College has seized to be an existential expedition; it has become a commodity, a good pitched and sold by tour guides and businessmen. Maybe back in the mystical 60’s college was an adventure, a real experience, a privilege. A generation ago the youth were ahead of the curve, setting the standard. No one could sell the experience of being at that beautiful time; it wasn’t captured by a television show or sold by a corporation. But today colleges boast of real world experience and a ticket to success for only $40,000 a year. Everyday thousands of parents are writing checks for their soon to be freshman and the more expens– I mean the more accredited, the better. College is being handed out to every 18 year old middle class child this country breeds, no questions asked; well, other than GPA and SAT scores. Now how could we ever be so silly as to think we could pay for experience?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is in this vicious system that I’ve seen many a peer trapped in the repetition of drinking games and final exams. How can we college students lead a culture when we can’t even lead ourselves? My generation was led to college before we left elementary school, and now we are being led into the real world by “professors” and “advisors.” We’ve been told we’re special since kindergarten, only to be led by those who we trust to the most deceptively conforming institutions on earth; the American college. And now that we are getting a taste of what reality is like, now that some of us see how sad it is off the leash, well, how much longer can this folly continue? At least I have dreams; but the others? They will career on, led by bosses and idols. But it’s not them I’m concerned about; I worry for posterity and my beloved country, because what is going to happen when everyone realizes how bad we’ve been swindled?</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Related: <a href="http://essay.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/letter-fortunately-college-has-changed/">A response to this essay from Mervin Jebaraj</a></p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This spring, Mervin Jebaraj, an Indian citizen from Dubai, stayed up all night to write the Arkansas Legislature a Sudan divestment letter. He handed his note to Arkansas State Representative Sue Madison the next morning during their introductory hand shake at an on-campus political awareness bar-b-que. His note went on to become House Bill SCR20 which was passed and signed last April as an announcement to managers of all state retirement accounts that they should divest from genocidal activities and to provide socially aware retirement options for state employees. Of course, Mervin did not invent the state’s divestment campaign, although he logged a full time job’s worth of campus and professionally oriented lobby hours to pass the bill. Instead, he developed the idea at a Washington D.C. student summit on genocide where he attended earlier during the winter term.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I learned about the divestment campaign’s details while hanging in a hammock in Dangriga, Belize. This summer, the University of Arkansas developed and sent development team along with Peacework International which included a delegation from each of the University’s colleges. Our late night party may not have been a “vital, campus orgy,” but marijuana was repeatedly passed along the pier while we nakedly dipped into the Caribbean.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We spoke during my fourth week in Belize where I was working to establish a University micro-credit fund. It has since become the first institution to specifically create educational loans on an organizational level. As I write this essay, I am again in Belize and living in Peacework’s commune with three female agricultural students from the US and a doctor researching a policy paper on waterborne illnesses. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My experience this summer illustrates why college campuses are no longer the center of American social movements. Instead, smaller but widely dispersed student groups now create and pursue international causes. The rise in both higher education funding and enrollment has facilitated a competitiveness that leads any motivated college student to spend at least a summer semester abroad. Look around the college campuses domestically and usually they are calm. This is because our many of our nation’s developing leaders are in places that are not calm. A short list of my friends’ current locations includes Croatia, China, India, Vietnam, Peru, Nicaragua and Nigeria.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Although they are distant, these students are not quiet. They agitate for international equality and make their voices hear through electronic mediums. Instead of letter writing and marches, Facebook is the collegiate culture’s informational source for social causes (where our microfinance fund information was quickly published) as well as economic and political debates. In thirty or forty years, when students from my generation are campaigning for political office, discovering their political passions during their college years will not be an anomaly such as Hillary Clinton’s letter, but will likely be available with a few mouse clicks on the “Facebook dataset.” This phenomenon was apparent just this morning when Caroline Giuliani, Rudy’s daughter, was identified as a Barack Obama supporter by the Harvard Crimson and later major news outlets based on her Facebook profile.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Students still spend most of their time debating issues in coffee shops. However, these coffee shops are no longer down the street from campuses. Instead they are in our residence hall basement and library in multiplying numbers, and we commonly rendezvous in cafés in Johannesburg, Antigua and Prague. However, our nation’s educational achievements mean that there is some consolidation in shared knowledge, which means that college students no longer debate easily defined and educationally clarified issues such as race and gender equality, but instead focus on related, but more technical arguments, which are usually difficult to riot over.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Since students have become broadly informed and more rational, it is becoming harder to rally around narrowly defined youth causes, which makes college much calmer. Similarly, it’s correct to say that the discrepancy between youth and adulthood has rapidly disintegrated as internships proliferate and job recruiting starts earlier. Similarly as we’ve matured, college students now recognize that they are global patrons who must advocate not only for their local causes, but for international ones. Issues and rallies are less consolidated on a physical level, but our efforts are more acute and we reach large and diverse audiences. Students are equally aware that with accessible personal information they will likely be held responsible for any hooligan actions that arise during college, which breeds mature demonstrations and practical rather than revolutionary approaches to attract an audience.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Admissions offices around the nation have embraced students’ international ambitions with equal enthusiasm. Thirty years ago, studying abroad was for the intellectual elite, primarily language based, and limited to western regimes. Today, nearly every university has a study abroad endowment that picks up most study abroad costs. Recruiters promote these opportunities with pitches similar to “join the Navy, see the world.” I was told “your education is now global; we’ll help you travel the world while you complete your degree.” This trend reached a new milestone last year when the Institute of International Education, which tracks study abroad statistics, reported that the number of US students abroad topped 200,000 for the first time which has increased 145% in the last decade.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As college opportunities proliferate, competition for the best student’s is no longer between the top twenty-five private institutions and a few unique privates. A growing majority of the nation’s elite 1% are entering what were once less glamorous public schools and their honors colleges because these large institutions have used state as well as private resources to attract the nation’s best. Many state schools now lead the international trend with elaborate pitches that include international service and research opportunities as well as provide individual fellowship applications that ask for not just student’s resumes, but their music and literary interests, photography portfolios and use interviews that identify their humor and curiosity.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The elite student diaspora to public schools and the number of students who are abroad has affected the physical centrality that once existed on college campuses. However, this has not diminished the student experience, but instead has spread the learning experience across the globe and allowed students to satisfy their intellectual curiosity internationally and in a more cosmopolitan atmosphere when at their home institution. Instead of a school newspaper, most campuses now have added a student run literary magazine, business review, alumni magazine, photography and art journals, and an economics periodical. Student voices are heard more loudly than ever before through these publications since it is students who handle the state’s economic data and are more likely than ever to freelance for major news organizations. Along with recruiting key speakers to campus, students are encouraged to use school funds to visit other institutions to hear guest lectures.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Unfortunately, excitement is far from universal and many institutions such as the University of Chicago have not adapted. Mr. Perlstein’s sample case is widely known to be among the most sedated campuses in the US. The campus is famous for not only its uncommon application, which is not special at all, but for its widely worn student t-shirts, which say, “The University of Chicago, where fun goes to die.” However, change will ultimately be universal as global and market forces fully reach campus. The competition and increase in opportunities has made college a more intense and creative experience than ever.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Rick Perlstein introduces his essay What’s the matter with college? with an anecdote from the 1966 California gubernatorial race between Governor Pat Brown and Ronald Reagan. Governor Brown recognized public higher education as a means for anyone desiring a better life through the better opportunities available to those with a college degree, and campaigned on his success in building a comprehensive state university system. Ronald Reagan, however, preached a return to the days of raccoon coats and silver flasks with few campuses, closed to all but the privileged white males.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Opening the California’s system of higher education to the masses, warned Reagan, has resulted in “sexual orgies so vile I cannot describe it to you.” Ah, the dangers of free thought and liberalism!</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And yes, the expansion of higher education throughout the 1960’s increased activities- anti-war demonstrations, free love, a drug culture- to which few Americans were familiar and even fewer understood. But these expressions of youthful rebellion were only a small part of a much larger experience, that of an opening of the intellect and the opportunity for lifestyle experimentation for millions of young people that young people of previous generations did not enjoy.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">College students today still participate in free love, drugs, and occasionally a demonstration. The matter with college today, to answer Mr. Perlstein’s question, is that the zeal to experiment, the thirst to test the status quo, the campus ferment resulting in the takeover of the university’s administration, demanding and obtaining changes in the university’s policies and procedures, has been replaced by the quest to graduate and get the “good job with good bennies.”</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The cost and financing of college has become the greatest influence on when students attend college, why they attend college, and their focus while in college. In the 1960’s, Pell Grants paid for substantially more a percentage of the cost of a student’s tuition. Many more high school graduates could attend college without the cost of college resulting in a significant burden on the family’s finances.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Pell Grants have not increased at the rate of inflation while the cost of college has far outpaced the rate of inflation, resulting in more students delaying college and fewer males attending college. The “non-traditional” i.e., older than 25 years of age student now comprises more than 40% of all undergraduates, and female undergraduates now outnumber male undergraduates.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Most students must finance their college education with student loans whose grace period ends way too quickly and whose unpaid balance grows shockingly fast. A student cannot discharge a student loan in bankruptcy except in the most desperate of situations and only after a separate hearing in the bankruptcy proceedings. (Film shorts exist of a 1965 medical college class of graduating students in cap and gown queued at the bankruptcy court’s clerk’s office, ready to end their student debt and begin their careers as doctors.)</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Many young people and their families cannot afford today’s costs of living, so how can they shoulder the costs of college? The majority of young people enter the working world after high school, discover the very limited opportunities that exist without a college education, and realize their dream of making a living are impossible without a college education. They then cobble together a schedule of evening, online, and commuter classes to complete the associate’s degree at a community college, fulfilling the sixty or so semester credits necessary to transfer to a university granting bachelor degrees.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">By the time the young person begins their quest for a college education they are in their mid-twenties or older, the “non-traditional” student. Often they are married, with children, with other demands and responsibilities that prohibit them from the newness of personal lifestyle experimentation without cost or consequence, unlike the 1960’s students who began college as an 18 or 19 year old freshman, free to stay up all night, smoking weed and having sex and even attending a class or two a semester, and their parents or the government paying the bills.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The culture and attitudes of the Intelligentsia which controls higher education has also radically changed since the 1960’s. The 21st century institution of higher education no longer sees its primary mission as creating an open environment in which minds would challenge the world heretofore as understood, probing with difficult and often unanswerable questions. No, the modern university is a “for profit non-profit.” Non-profit in terms of the tax code, but for profit in its policies and operation. Today’s university president must possess above all qualities the ability to raise money, lots of money, in a way that leaves the donor begging to give more. How does this “for profit non-profit” invest the incredibly obscene amounts of cash to raise even more money? The University hires faculty that know how to obtain research grants from the government and private business. Coaches are hired that build winning seasons, resulting in lucrative television contracts. Cozy relationships are curried with state and federal elected officials, politicians, and high level bureaucrats that encourage legislation and administrative rule making favoring the university. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) was the hallmark legislation that granted higher education the cover for the quid pro quo necessary for successful and prosperous lobbying of government and private money sources. No one outside of a few high ranking officials within every university or college know who receives the majority of scholarships granted by a university every year. The family members, sons, daughters, grandchildren, etc of those whose influential individuals in government the universities have developed a favored relationship anonymously enjoy the fruits of those relationships. Public policy through these relationships are also greatly affected, often at the expense of the masses that are aware of the ethically questionable scholarships. Universities guard most jealously their autonomy and their authority to choose for themselves who within the university speaks for the university. The campus takeovers of the 1960’s have little chance of occurring today. Unlike the 1960’s, when the college president was a visible figure on campus and the president’s focus was the student body composed of individual students, and the college president, even on a big campus, likely knew the name of the student protester, today’s college president cares about any particular student only when an incident occurs that might possibly affect the institution’s image. So what’s the matter with college? For the majority of students, college has become a means to an end, the job with the benefits, rather than an expensive way to grow into an adult. And universities have exchanged their souls for a life of ease and privilege.</p>

           </header> 
           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In September 2005, my parents abandoned me to my minuscule dorm room, my Midwestern roommate, and the absurdly lush campus of Wellesley College. In my first year, the college was in the midst of the biggest fundraising campaign in its history. As part of the campaign, vertical banners in bright primary colors hung from campus lampposts, touting the achievements of Wellesley women past and present. Publicly a source of many jokes, the three banner designs read, in order, “Women Who Will / Make A Difference / In The World.”</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Privately, the banners were a source of consternation for me. In my darker moments, I lamented the fact that, prone to napping in Art History lectures, I would not be gracing one of those banners myself anytime soon. In more contrary moods, I resented the use of the future tense. It seemed to me that a donation to Wellesley should be intended to benefit and enhance the education the college provides to its students, and not to support their vague and undefined futures once outside the college’s gates.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Having witnessed Brandeis University, my brother’s alma mater, solicit donations from him before he walked in his graduation ceremony, I knew that one never quite escapes the reach of one’s college. However, I remain convinced that Wellesley’s casual choice of words–“women who will make a difference in the world”–is indicative of a distressing trend in American higher education: the transformation of college to commodity.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With a price tag of more than $40,000 per year, calling an education at an elite college anything but a commodity seems strange. However, education, and particularly higher education, is more than a sum of the appropriate economic metaphors–futures trading, stocks bought and sold, an investment rather than an experience.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">College matters. A place where students from diverse backgrounds, races, religions, incomes, geographical origins, and experiences come together for four years of intense intellectual engagement and socialization, college is unique in the American experience. It is one of the few places where a blonde-haired South Carolina Republican can be found sitting relatively amicably alongside a liberal, gay New Yorker in a classroom, a place where students have the same opportunity to study genetics as religion, Newtonian mechanics as Alfred, Lord Tennyson.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Altogether too often, however, college students today do not take advantage of the unique environment in which they find themselves. Freed of the racial quotas of mid-century and aided by the proliferation of student organizations catering to specific racial and religious groups, students voluntarily segregate themselves by race, religion, or sexual orientation, negating the benefits of “diverse” campuses. Having spent their entire lives preparing to apply to college, from elementary school tutus to middle school cleats, eighth grade French lessons to tenth grade SAT prep, suburban hyper-achievers find themselves bereft of purpose on a college campus. Having felt entitled to a college education for as long as they can remember, students fail to recognize the opportunities offered by their colleges outside of the facts and figures presented in the glossy viewbook and, instead of seizing upon the four years of their college education as a time of growth and discovery, fall instead into apathy, resignation, and the routine stand-in for learning: resume-building. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Old habits die hard, and it is difficult to let go of a lifetime of over-commitment and resume polishing simply because one suddenly finds oneself high in an ivory tower. Concerned with the bottom line–the final grade–students are loathe to waste time reading the newspaper, going to a museum, or picking up a book that isn’t featured on one of their syllabi. As a consequence, on a campus with a preponderance of political science majors, it is difficult to engage students in a discussion about the war in Iraq or problems with the American education system at Wellesley. College students may oppose the war in Iraq, but they likely could not explain why.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Why is a question that is often glossed over in college applications. The occasional application may leave enough space for a few sentences on the why–Why Wellesley? Why Georgetown? Why U. Chicago? As a high school senior, I always found these the hardest questions to answer, and for good reason: I did not have a clear idea of why I wanted to attend college beyond the fact that it was what came next.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If college is to ever return to its status as a place of self-discovery, an incubator of social activism and change, we need to begin asking the why questions more insistently and often than we do today. We must press college-bound students and their parents to ask themselves why–Why Harvard? Why Duke? And, most saliently, Why college? It is my belief that many of today’s college students would have benefited from taking a “gap year” between high school and college, a practice common in Europe. Precisely how they choose to spend that year is unimportant. What is important is allowing students to take the time to consider their motivations for attending college, to gain experience outside of a formal school setting, and to temporarily escape the pressure-cooker atmosphere common among high-achieving students. Asking Why college? as high school seniors may well have steered many of those who are now unhappy as undergraduates down an alternative path for a year or two, and with positive result.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I love my college, and I love the experience of being in college. As a political philosophy and art history concentrator, I often joke that I am actually getting a degree in “argument and pretty pictures.” Although I occasionally worry about a life without health insurance or marketable skills, I know that there are few places besides college where I can indulge my love of John Stuart Mill and medieval cathedral architecture. In short, college affords me the opportunity to be esoteric without consequence, and it saddens me to see my peers treat college as a necessary detour on their way to more important destinations, as something to get through rather than something to savor.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The “Women Who Will” banners are gone from Wellesley’s campus now, but the sentiment remains. Complaining about the college and applying for prestigious outside jobs, internships, and fellowships vie for status as the most popular pastime of the student body, and I suspect that the situation of students at other elite college and universities is much the same. If applicants should ask themselves why, undergraduates should move beyond asking what–What is it about my school that bothers me? What could I be doing instead?–and turn instead to the how. How can I help improve my college? How can I make the most of my time here–and of my $40,000?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">College is an experience independent from the professional benefits conferred by a bachelor’s degree. The sooner applicants, students, parents, and college administrations remember this, the more vibrant, interesting, and relevant our college campuses will be. College matters. However, without real change in the way that Americans think, talk, and write about college from application to graduation, college will complete the transformation from experience to commodity, and only the aging hippie professors–and the occasional New York Times Magazine article–will notice.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My Dad, a Brooklyn Dodgers fan from the start used to attend games in regularity with his Norwegian neighborhood friends, way in the back, high up in the stands, popping peanuts into mouths that were busy shouting at the umpires and error happy ball players. Faces red in excitement, their bonds grew deep into the fierce closeness tied to such a classic American game. It took a scorching summer evening at a Philadelphia Phillies game for me to finally understand my father and his love for baseball. Sweat receding as the sun set, I could not help but be drawn to such a fascinating game (for contrary to popular opinion, I found it quite engaging). However, the joy and progression of the baseball game was soon overshadowed by the suffocating commercialism and false countenance that filled the stadium. Glancing around I noticed the American stereotype in all it’s glory: Chase Utley jerseys so snug around big bellies, empty cups of steak flavored slushies strewn about, and somehow an overabundance of cell phone users discussing important business in the middle of the fourth inning. Dolefully, I was overwhelmed by such an oblivion to the beautifully graceful sport that was being played there in the lights. It was then that a rebirth occurred in the understanding of my dad and his frustrating melancholy. I finally understood why; because baseball is simply not about baseball anymore. In fact, my father and I are not so far apart in our frustrations with the world for when people ask me, “why are you not return to school in the fall?” I explain, how college is not about knowledge anymore.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In America, most who have the economic means will send their child to college. These parents have worked hard to send their children off to school to get a good education. They take pride in this (as did my parents) to see that their child increase his or her chances of entering into a monetary beneficial field, thus allowing their child a comfortable and capitally driven lifestyle. It’s the American dream is it not? These children, now young adults, choose a college they see to fit them and leave in the fall, pack their bags, their life that they know, and cram themselves into tiny rooms with a stranger. Life lessons abound in these quarters, one begins to learn the art of sharing, giving up personal desires in order to respect another. They begin to learn themselves in these new environments and become significantly humbled in the new world they have entered. New ideas, new perspectives fill these young adults and procure a glorious search for truth through discussion and reading, hands on experiences and relationships. Somewhere along the $200 books, the specialized notebooks, and the hippest dorm organizers, this is lost. Soon facebook.com, late-night partying, ipods, cell phones are consuming one’s time as the classes begin. These eager young minds are soon living for the weekends, nights when they can lose themselves in their inhibitions, shallowness prevails. Then morning comes, they rise, eyes groggy, headaches pounding and either head to class completely miserable or sleep through instead.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The truth is gone! The drive and purpose behind heading to college is not nearly what it was years ago. Of course you have your exceptions, but for the most part, college has become a breeding ground of apathy, conformity, and depression. It is no more to learn, it is no more to better oneself with knowledge. Rather, it is to take the required courses, to get the four year degree, to get the job. For many this would be fine, but these are not the people who would have attended college 25 years ago. What does it do for individuals heading to college for knowledge alone? It creates a dangerously discouraging environment, for where intellect is supposed to be stimulated, it is actually doing the exact opposite. I cannot believe students pay so much money per year to be expected to do the minimum by professors, to be given assignments that create more technological frustration then actual absorption of information or engagement of one’s mind.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Such a deep part of so many desire to discover truth, to understand the world around, to create and connect, to wonder and push beyond what the usual mind set holds as correct. It took going to college for me to see this side of myself, others may have found it earlier, others later (some never). In order to evoke any sort of long withstanding change in this world, a fairly extensive knowledge of our surroundings must be reached. I am most certainly not alone. Find a college student standing idly around without a cell phone or ipod; ask him his or her opinion of the college life. I have a feeling you will receive an intense reviling not far from my own. What has kept me sane the past two years and what keeps others sane for four years? Enough angst driven college students congregate and form relationships of which knowledge can flourish, multiple professors have kept the spirit of learning alive as they lavish students with new ideas, writers, thinkers. But they are not the hub of the university anymore. Instead, the centrifuge is the student activities, the football teams, the fraternities, and community service organizations which look good on resumes. College is an amusement park, in which we pay for our thrills, our fun built for us, entertainment provided. I ask in desperation, where are the thinkers of our time?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is the year 2007, and rarely are things in this American society about truth. It is the false appearance, the deprecating facade that most of the American community becomes a slave. Aspects of genuineness steadily disappear! Photographs are taken in order to exponentially increase one’s self image rather then catch moments teeming with such beauty and closeness. Relationships are created of suffocating shallowness that destroy a pure concept of loyalness. In the search to find the fast and easiest ways of life, there is a lack of process, a lack of journey. Herein, at the end of our days, at the end of our experiences, we are nothing. We have learned nothing and the potential depth of our character has shrunk disastrously in size. This is what is happening at colleges around the nation. Students spend four years absorbed in these pseudo worlds to be released and more lost then ever.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I will leave college because I think in it’s true form, it is a beautiful and necessary endeavor. I leave because I cannot stand to be apart of something so warped from it’s true purpose. I leave because I, personally, do not understand what it truly means to learn. And so I depart. Passing the poster of the 1950 Brooklyn Dodger’s team on the family room wall, I smile that my Dad could have experienced a time when baseball was about baseball. I smile to myself, because for the first time in the past 12 years of public school, I will learn just for the pure joy of learning.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Rick Perlstein’s critique of the American university establishment went great lengths to pull apart the increasingly homogenized fabric of our academic culture. I believe he could have gone further. Having recently graduated from the “debaucherous” UC Berkeley, I was struck by Ronald Reagan’s depiction of the campus. His concerns couldn’t have been more shortsighted; in reality, I would argue that UC Berkeley represents a startling trend evident in the elite universities of this country. Contrary to Reagan’s claims, the campus is not licentious, but rather, is growing increasingly conservative and homogenous. The university is no longer a bastion of liberalism and free-thinking, but an entity conforming to the same pressures it purports to resist, and the student body, faculty and academic freedom in general suffer.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">From their undergraduate divisions, to the professional and graduate programs in law and business, academic institutions have developed a homogenized and increasingly standardized establishment that eliminates risk. Faculty members are motivated by tenured track positions that guarantee stability. Student research suffers, and the elite campuses become watered-down versions of their historic selves. Schools allow themselves to be bullied by a test-taking industry and ranking system metastasized at the elementary and high school level in the form of “No Child Left Behind” and enforced by the powerful US News &amp; World Report ranking systems. An April 2006 letter addressed to law school applicants and signed by nearly all 192 ABA-accredited law schools complained that “ranking systems are inherently flawed because none of them can take (a student’s) special needs and circumstances into account.” They condemn the ranking process, yet employ the same ranking systems and homogenizing factors to eliminate law school candidates in the form of an absolute standardized test – the LSAT. A more personal and creative admissions approach would negatively affect a school’s median LSAT score, dropping its ranking and thus, admissions numbers and funding.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I have experienced the negative effects of such standardization, graduating from Berkeley in 2007 with a degree in anthropology. I maintained a 3.98 GPA, was a member of the Dean’s Honor’s list throughout my time at Cal and was admitted into the Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society. I was a preliminary finalist for the university’s most prestigious award, the University Medal, and was also a runner up for the McCown Prize, awarded to the outstanding graduate of anthropology. Outside the classroom, I played inter-collegiate baseball at a top junior college program until injury forced an early retirement, refereed intra-mural sports at Cal, and volunteered my services to the Cal Women’s basketball team. I also worked in the community for the YMCA, directing an after-school sports program for at-risk youth and coaching several youth baseball teams. I was not, however, admitted to a number of top law schools. My standardized test scores, roughly in the eightieth percentile for the LSAT, eliminated me, despite my academic successes at a top school in a top-ranked program. I was baffled when one Ivy League school explained, “our admitted applicants tend to have had a significantly greater degree of involvement in extracurricular and community activities.” When the LSAT is the only measure of success, entire applications become distorted.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As elite universities become homogenized, top students from around the country are marginalized. Like the lecturer looking for a recipe to a tenured position, students subscribe to a template for success where grooming for test-taking begins in elementary school and internships and volunteerism are routine necessities, rather than personal commitments. Standardized test results outweigh four years of academic excellence, and generic service bereft of passion supercedes creativity. The pluralism in the selection process leads not to creative and unique individuals being admitted, but rather “diverse” versions of the same person.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Universities have embraced clever ways of internalizing this trend, naturalizing their selection process through subtle controlling processes that allow them to uphold their “standards” for ranking and maintaining the status quo. The “celebration” of diversity on campus has been hijacked by this ideology. The University of California, for example, while outwardly promoting diversity and freethinking, tacitly encourages quite the opposite. Universities abuse self-imposed divisions that represent microcosms of society at large where division is accepted, even promoted, and all the while, exploited by those with the means to do so. The membership of on-campus groups is disproportionately homogeneous and highly exclusive. Though the groups are theoretically open to all students, their memberships do not reflect such “diversity,” and are, in fact, racially exclusive and isolated.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is understandable why individuals would feel it necessary to join groups of their own cultural background. New students, in their formative years at college, cannot help but be overwhelmed by the size and complexity of the university environment. Issues of identity are more overwhelming than ever in this setting, and race and religion act as common and comforting themes. Berkeley professor, Jerry Sanders, likens this to “strategic essentialism,” the process whereby minority groups fear being swallowed by the majority and band themselves together, even if it means labeling themselves by a racial or religious identity. Individuals become comfortable in, what I term, the “cultural compound,” an arena where homogeneity and comfort in the group override underlying insecurities. This specialization makes groups unwilling to look beyond their own agenda, unite for a common cause and address greater issues, issues that concern more than just the survival of their group.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a broader context, the “cultural compound” that we see on campus has some dangerous parallels to the American society at large. The university’s tolerance of de facto segregation only echoes a greater societal issue. Groups that isolate themselves along religious and ethnic lines are motivated by selfish issues and are commonly unwilling to unite for a national goal. The Indian Student Association seeks to promote Indian culture on campus, while the Asian Business Society looks to increase Asian representation in the business school. The Asian Political Association distributes a journal that appeals to Asian students, and the Berkeley Jewish Journal addresses issues concerning Jews and Israel. Their publications pertain to exclusive groups, and while they have every right to do so, they isolate themselves under the guise of “diversity.” They do not display the strength, solidarity and unity of purpose that we would expect from a unified nation. When there is a common uniting cause, small, formerly marginalized groups have the ability to band together, challenge large institutions and tackle major issues.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Universities prosper in the current environment. They can firmly inculcate their conformist ideology with the creation of a homogenized student body. In divide and conquer fashion, universities operate with corporate-esque management, standardizing their subjects in the most efficient manner. In so doing, a student body that is apathetic and uncritical will emerge, an uncontroversial faculty is born, and universities once heralded for their academic freedom and free-thinking ways will suffer.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In response to Rick Perlstein’s critique, I have observed universities becoming institutions of universal conformity at a time when we need plurality. They must break free of their corporate bonds and embrace a doctrine of academic freedom that begins with multiplicity in admissions. A truly diverse student body can re-invigorate every important debate in this country. A homogenized university system cannot.</p>

            <address class="byline author vcard"></address> 
           </header> 
           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">College matters for so many different reasons. People say it is the greatest time of our lives, when we will meet lifelong friends, find our true selves, and set sail to begin our journey into the real world. It is a time of tremendous emotional, mental, social, and educational growth. The freedoms granted by American universities are unparalleled across the world. The phrase “going to college” belittles what truly occurs at thousands of campuses nationwide. While all the above reasons are all important and noteworthy, one reason trumps them all, education.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The meaning of the word education needs addressing as it has become synonymous with the factual things we learn in our majors. Many of those who have never had the privilege of attending college unfortunately have this view of the word education. I too had this false impression as I first began college. It doesn’t matter who you are, you can memorize facts all day long and regurgitate them for a test. What does that prove? Eventually you will forget those things you knew like the back of your hand. As someone who is interning right now, I speak from experience in claiming you only use a fraction of your education to perform your job. Simply put there exists too many fields and specialties to be an expert in all of them. A mechanical engineer who is an expert in diesel fuel systems may not be able to tell you the first thing about an automatic transmission. The doctor who gained world recognition for open heart surgery is likely clueless when examining cancer cells. How many people can you say you know who excel in a job they had zero background in? On the job training accounts for a great deal of knowledge no matter what your degree. Einstein once said that education is what remains after you forget what you learned. So why then bother learning a specific field at all?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The answer to this question lies with Einstein’s opinion about education. Education is that residue that remains with us the rest of our lives. Your education rounds you and lays the foundation for learning in the future. To me, college has been a humbling and eye-opening experience to the vastness of knowledge that humankind has accumulated. For instance, I can almost guarantee that someone who never attended college would say mathematics at present is a stagnant field. Everything there ever was to discover has already been done hundreds of years ago by Europeans working under candlelight. Taking several math classes for my major removed my myopic vision. Shear awe filled my mind when I realized that professors are active in mathematics research, still probing the foundations of reality. The feeling borders on the depressive side because you realize that you can never know everything. Being exposed to some very bright professors has been a blessing. Just the presence of some professors creates an atmosphere of intelligence that seems to diffuse all around them.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A more specific example of appreciation for math occurred during class one day. I was taking a major course in numerical methods. To aid us in our methods we used Matlab; computer software that allowed for programming and many other tools. Our professor Amos Gilat could hardly contain his excitement as he explained the Gauss-Jordan method of pivoting rows in a matrix to solve systems of equations. Knowing that you could solve a system with a simple pre-programmed operation in Matlab I asked why we needed to learn about the pivoting, which consumed a great deal of time and was done by hand. Professor Gilat was dismayed and proceeded on a 5 minute tangent aimed at proving that is precisely why we chose to attend a university and not a technical school. I then realized that 20 years from know when I have to solve a system of equations I will do it the easy way, with a computer. But in the back of my head there will remain that appreciation for the men whose lives were devoted to the advancement of their field.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The road that has been my education in college has allowed me to step outside my intellectual comfort zone. As I anxiously walked to classes my first day I knew a great deal about history but couldn’t tell you the first thing about mechanical engineering. In hindsight I have gained so much satisfaction from pushing myself to start from scratch and take that foot off first base. In short, college has changed my perspective. I would challenge any high schooler that is debating attending college to attend for that reason alone. Of all the things our country needs, one of them is a population whose perspective isn’t fixed in stone. In this era of record egotism and narcissism, we desperately need citizens who have an enlightened perspective of the world around them. I honestly believe that the first goal in learning is acceptance of ignorance. The bigger the college the better, the further from home the better, and the more diverse the student body the better. Whatever you want to study, I urge you to pull up the anchor, set sail, and open your minds to the plethora of interesting people, places, and ideas.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Today, the college experience is more trade school, less ancient Greek academy.<br> In our increasingly complex society, its constituents have to be better educated before they can become productive participants. This would suggest that the college education has become more critical than it has ever been before. The college experience, being the manner in which the education is received, might be more telling with respect to college’s ultimate impact on society. In his recent comment in the New Yorker, Louis Menand cited that: </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“The biggest undergraduate major by far in the United States today is<br> business. Twenty-two percent of bachelor’s degrees are awarded in that field.<br> Eight percent are awarded in education, five percent in the health professions. By contrast, fewer than four percent of college graduates major in English, and only two percent major in history. There are more bachelor’s degrees awarded every year in Parks, Recreation, Leisure, and Fitness Studies than in all foreign languages and literatures combined. The Carnegie Foundation for the<br> Advancement of Teaching, which classifies institutions of higher education, no<br> longer uses the concept “liberal arts” in making its distinctions. This makes the obsession of some critics of American higher education with things like whether Shakespeare is being required of English majors beside the point. The question isn’t what the English majors aren’t taking; the question is what everyone else isn’t taking.” </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Perlstein’s bold forecast really is in the wrong tense. College as America<br> used to understand it is not coming, but has already come to an end. The real question is whether it is dead or just dormant. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The 1960’s and 70’s were witness to a unique combination of economic<br> prosperity that allowed children from families of modest means to attend college for the first time, and were still a time when being an English major was not looked down upon with derision (usually with respect to their relative employability upon graduation). Intellectual merit was still the common currency used in conversation. At the same time, it would be reasonable to argue that this inclusion of the middle class would reduce the level of intellectualism in college, because students coming from a modest background would identify more with the necessity of needing practical skills for entering the marketplace. However, one must acknowledge that from a financial perspective, attending college used to be less of a risk in terms of the skills acquired for<br> the debt accumulated. Students simply were not as worried about leaving college with no prospects of paying the debts they had acquired with the degree they had chosen to pursue. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Menand’s statistics make it perfectly clear that in today’s world, the study of English, for example, is not a subject that is in vogue. Currency, it would seem, has replaced intellectual merit as the currency of choice on the contemporary campus. For reasons that perhaps only a historical perspective will make clear, students today have a completely different set of values and priorities when it comes to education. For some students, the liberal education is ‘that irritating set of general requirements that one has to complete in order to graduate’. In 1999 the University of Chicago, famous for its ‘core<br> curriculum’ or required distribution of study through a wide variety of subjects, transitioned to making this required distribution smaller, in an attempt to make it more desirable to potential attendees. This attitude could be correlated with the rising cost of higher education. College is expensive, and one way to economize is to take as few classes outside of one’s major as possible. Many people speak of graduating early, in fewer than four years. This is a critical devaluation of one of the fundamental aspects of the college experience: the education and learning outside of what is strictly necessary. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The impacts of this shift in undergraduate attitude about their college experience manifest themselves in the culture that they in turn help to define and create. When people refer to the golden age of Greece, they are talking about the period in time when great advances and achievements were made in the arts, philosophy (which at that time included science), and governing theory. This was a time when the resources and priorities of the Grecian society were focused on those topics. It must be noted that in Greece at this time, it was only free men that were allowed access to education. This exclusivity is in direct conflict with the attitude of openness and availability to education<br> that came about in the 1960’s. Today, we don’t admire the ancient Greeks for their methods, but rather for the cultural priorities they identified and extent to which they achieved and excelled in them. These are the very same subjects that are associated with the historical view of college and the college experience. The move away from this interest in learning for the sake of learning in the undergraduate body is inextricably linked to this same interest in greater society, just as the undergraduate body attending college is inextricably linked to the society from which it came and to which it will eventually return. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The question of the significance of the college experience relative to our<br> generation then becomes one of deciding our cultural priorities and values. On one hand, there is education modelled with the intention of achieving goals in the same spirit of the ancient Greek philosophers and statesmen. The other option is to treat the college experience as the period of time between high school and entering the workforce proper. For those of us who value what higher education and the college experience has historically represented, public complacency towards college is an alarming indication of how far in the opposite direction we have travelled, therefore making it paramount that the classical college experience needs to be revitalized, while maintaining the openness<br> and availability that was achieved in the 1960’s, as it is more critical than ever before.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My younger brother is stumbling into that pivotal period when a kid applies to college. We’re a family of corn-fed, country folk from rural Illinois, and since my older brother goes to Loyola University Chicago and I go to Northwestern University, little Louis is scrutinizing The University of Chicago.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He’ll be in the final group of college aspirants to fill out the university’s quirky application that asks the applicant about a few of his favorite things. Next year the university, along with many others, will start accepting the Common Application.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Louis told me he wrote about David Byrne, David Lynch, and the value of the incomprehensible.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I would have written about Heidegger,” I said. “I thought I liked Heidegger when I was your age. But that’s when I was young and stupid.”</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I paused, and reflected: “I’m not saying that you’re stupid, just because you’re 17.”</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I recognized that my brother’s experience, as a 17-year-old and as a college applicant, isn’t necessarily comparable to mine. That’s the difference between Rick Perlstein and me. I’m aware that I’m looking at Louis’ application process through the jaded beer goggles of a second-year college student. In his essay “What’s the Matter with College?” Perlstein observes modern college life though the rose colored glasses of a 38-year-old, but he either lacks the self-awareness to realize he’s doing it, or he doesn’t care because he is being paid to do it.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There is a third, more benign possibility: It’s fun to reminisce. What grandparent doesn’t regale grandchildren with tales of “the good old days,” when gas was thirty cents a gallon?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The good old days aren’t the good old days except to people who were there. The grandkids are usually bored stiff. I can’t get nostalgic for the version of college Perlstein describes, or for the visions of college perpetuated by TV and movies.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Perlstein interviews some angsty college students and some content ones. Both sets of kids disturb him. He recognizes in the former group frustration at the lack of creative and cultural stimuli and in the latter group an unhealthy enthusiasm for organization and career mongering. What do both have in common? They’re running circles around campus.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In my first year of college, I met those kids Perlstein describes. I met the types like his creative and frustrated Hamilton Morris, and the Caroline Ouwerkerk types who soak up all the organizational goodness available. The content ones spend weekends drinking at frat parties, and the frustrated ones spend time wondering if they would be more or less miserable drinking at a frat party rather than sitting in their four by six dorm room.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I’d have to count myself as a disheartened Hamilton Morris. My first few weekends at college were an agonizing Ferris wheel of impotency and frustration. Then one Friday night I made a resolution. I resolved that I wouldn’t spend one more weekend on campus.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I didn’t. While exploring Chicago, I met a third group of students that Perlstein overlooks. Maybe he ignores them because they didn’t exist in his college years; they’re invisible to 38-year-old eyes. They’re college kids who spend their Friday nights haunting Indie film theatres, or finding out which venues let a kid in to a show with a friend’s sister’s out-of-state ID. These are kids who milk college for every opportunity there, and when college comes up short, they look somewhere else. They’re college kids who don’t haunt the campus.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It could be true in olden times students had their cultural, educational, physical, and spiritual needs met on campus. It might have been a warm bath of vital stimulations for all I know. His article makes it sound like a one-stop-shop of bliss.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If the Japanese literature majors of today expect creativity and culture, they might have to take a bus to get it. Perlstein says the gap between “college” and “the real world” is closing. If this means the homeless guy who always rides the Purple Line at midnight is going to try to sell me his poetry, that’s fine by me. I thought student rights activists of the 60s and 70s wanted to free students from the protective bubble of their adolescence, not build a more glamorous one.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Why does college matter? I can’t speak for everyone, but I’m getting an education. I certainly didn’t get one in high school. I didn’t know where else to turn. I’m training for my career, plodding down the yellow brick road to a degree that I faithfully believe will garner me some sort of credit in a “real world” I glimpse sometimes through the briefcases and wristwatches of the businessmen, or the beaten black pants of the working poor I see when I’m downtown, away from campus.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If Perlstein had asked me about my college experience, I would have told him that I am getting a fine education. If America’s public school system has deteriorated as much as the press and politicians lead me to believe, then a college education is more vital than ever. My university offers accredited teachers in a variety of subjects and plenty of tools to help me start a career. It might be the generation gap speaking, but when Crispin Glover is in Chicago premiering his new movie, or Norman Mailer is downtown doing a book signing, I don’t expect the university to hold my hand. I can afford the train ticket.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Perlstein seems to lament the push, starting with outrage over activism at Berkeley, to make universities “institutions of learning” at the expense of finer stuff.. Maybe it happened. But that doesn’t mean youth culture is dead. It means it shifted. Kids will have to look a little harder to find it it won’t be a package deal.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A college, as is any institution, is made of people. Should we be asking: “What’s the matter with college kids?” Perlstein’s essay lamented the loss of universities as a cultural and political force. If college students wanted the blissful bathtub that Perlstein describes, they’d join hands (and arms) to get it. Most undergrads are “Organization Kids” who can’t be happier. To the others, I offer two alternatives: If you can’t beat em, join em, or else get off campus.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It’s true that if my 17-year-old self had to apply to the University of Chicago next year, there is no way that the board of admissions would know about my Heidegger fascination. Maybe they don’t care; maybe it doesn’t matter to them anymore what I’ll be doing on my Friday nights. I think I like it better that way.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I’m responding to a position I can’t understand. It’s like asking someone with a flat screen TV to talk about cathode ray tubes. Not having attended University of Chicago with Perlstein, I can’t tell him if undergrads would have the guts to try to arrange a concert with Ravi Shankar and John Coltrane. I can tell him that when Shankar came to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra last April, my peers and I coughed up $20 for nosebleed seats. Student tickets weren’t available.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">After only one semester at Washington University, it seems to me that most college students–most of my peers–are much more apathetic than I had always imagined they would be. I grew up hearing that “children are the future,” and it made sense to me that the four years of college were when the children created and became the future. While this may have been true in another generation, it certainly doesn’t seem to be the case now.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There once was a time when the phrases “college student” and “student activist” were closely linked. When you think about college students, you might remember the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. These college students sat down at lunch counters and refused to leave until they were treated equally. They marched to Washington and Montgomery with Dr. King to gain rights for their parents, their children, and themselves. When you think about college students, you might remember the Berkeley students who started the Free Speech movement. These college students wouldn’t allow their voices to be silenced. They chose to go to jail before they would give up their rights as Americans. When you think about college students, you might remember the Kent State students who protested the Vietnam War. They were willing to put their lives on the line to tell their government to end an unjust war. What do all of these college students have in common? Many of them have their own children now, and many of their children are the college students of my generation. Now, their children are the future. When history thinks about college students, will it remember college students from my generation?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Probably not, because college students from my generation are too apathetic to exercise their right to vote, let alone their rights to speak freely or protest the government. Last semester, I was involved in a massive voter registration effort on campus. We bombarded students with voter registration forms as they walked to and from classes. We brought forms to classes and registered our friends. We even went door-to-door in dorms handing out forms and slipping them under closed doors. Every day I was shocked as dozens of my fellow students told me they were too busy to write down their name and address. They told me they were too busy to sign a piece of paper. They told me they were too busy to care about the future of their world.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When the world needed changing, you used to be able to look to college students to catalyze that change. But when the world needs change again, where will you find the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committees of today? Where will you find the new proponents of the Free Speech movements? Where will you find the next protestors against an unjust war? I don’t think you will find them in the college students of my generation anymore. We just don’t care.</p>

            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A nippy answer to a particular question is always appealing. To the challenge what’s the matter with college, even Yoda could quickly convince you in a blink with one of his babblings: the nature of its current existence cloaks its presence . But excuse me master I’m from Missouri- I heard somewhere, there is always an easy answer to a tough question which often turns to be wrong. Would be this the case? Coins have two sides, but in describing just one, Mr. Perlstein seems to get the upper hand in the prognosis of present college affairs. A broader look on the casus belli is therefore desired. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Recent undergraduate lifestyles seem to confirm the public belief that students are only being trained in slackology and beerology in college halls around the nation. But we all should put our sleeve’s aces on the table and describe both sides of the coin. Even if our actions seem to have decayed in recent decades, they didn’t from an effective point of view, just from a spotlighted one. Sorry, but it’s not our fault that the CNN &amp; friends are not interested in us anymore because we have developed a refined savoir fair in what college agitations matters; it’s not our fault that we have become a bunch of sissies because our building takeovers are now ridiculously peaceful instead of riotously disruptive. Therefore, as if a past collective experience in failures would have been instilled upon us, our MOs have evolved, becoming less trade-marketable but still exacting a toll, and this time an effective one. Are you skeptical about that last point? Oh well, just go and ask Galla udet’s deposed university president about what is it like to complain to deaf students who kick him out. And don’t forget the cherry on top, George Allen, the hapless ex-senator from Virginia brought down by a wannabe freshman. Now, the sort of campus scandals that lead this country forty years ago have been integrated into the college system. That’s what makes them lose the media’s mojo and give the false sensation of disappearance. An example are the Democratic Education at Cal classes at Berkeley, where the vile sexual orgies Ronnie complained against Pat Brown in the sixties now give you university credits instead.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That’s how the undergraduates of our generation should be remembered: the baby boomers’ cool Prometheuses. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But wait, not all is going to be roses and wine in fancy grammar inspired by listening to Paris Hilton’s post-jail renaissance, of course. Our Nemeses have strong points against us which have to be carefully addressed. As already mentioned, there is the popular belief flying over the cuckoo’s nest that we care more about American Idols and beer pongs, than sex, counter-culture and global problems. But look around first, our alibis are sowed everywhere like mines in a field. Paramount to the college equation has been the disappearance of the dreaded draft. Is it our fault that this nation’s fairness has increased and gone are the chances of getting arbitrarily killed in war? The absence of that hornets’ hive is something our past generations didn’t have the chance to sleep with, and even if there is a nasty war going on, that absence is the factor in keeping everybody cool government and students alike. Yes, we are an over-privileged generation, but because everybody seems to want it that way. With financial help striking us 24/7 and persuasive gadgetry constantly popping out, it’s difficult not to become spoiled. Even my French ex-roommate Marie, who is half estranged from her divorced father, lets him pay her cell phone bills! Yes, we should start saying just don’t do it, please .</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We are accused too of lacking that cultural extravaganza that flourished in the halls of past generations. All in all, if Britney Spears and Bono don’t give free concerts in our restrooms it’s because we don’t dare to call them, not because the present singing styles have become so much spectacle and video-oriented that a performance in the dorms would be a little like an Einstein lecture in Martha Stewart’s cooking sessions.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Can we refute statements like colleges are no longer central? Well, how would you define ‘centrality’? Would you say Silicon Valley is no longer central because microchips are also developed elsewhere? The key to centrality here is: Who is your daddy? That is, who is instrumental for accomplishing X? To that point, did Mr. Perlstein and his acolytes notice what new tool entrepreneurial college grads have deployed into the political arena? Right, calling it just political would be inaccurate. One would need to say, googolplex-faceted. I’m talking about You Tube. Ludicrous as it may sound, with the Facebooks and cell phones wired to, students around the nation are now being empowered with a brand new way to create, say, pressure groups in matter of days or inflict righteous changes in politic campaigns. Beg to differ about that? Ask the aforementioned George Allen, the former republican senator who lost his re-election bid against a camcorder, after his private linguistic h eritage took off in public and got massively distributed over the Internet. And do you recall Jean Rohe, the student who at The New School’s 2006 graduation ceremony admonished senator McCain for not representing the values of that university? Her remarks were posted online mere hours later! What undergraduate wildest dreams in the seventies would have imagined having such tools with potential to equalize TV and newspapers but from an independent perspective? We will see how these incidents are just the beginning in a long streak of future leading revelations. Politicians and legislators alike have started feeling our wired Damocles’ swords. Now, they are trying to get in our tune and be as cool as we are. Do you need proof? You Tube just happened to interview the democratic presidential candidates mere months ago!</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Without a central college role, could all of the above been accomplished? Hardly. Then why is that feeling that our generation is precisely accomplishing nothing and just downloading songs? Partly, because our actions have slightly shifted from global to local, and surprisingly, because we are actually busier than our parents were at their college age. According to a survey conducted by Arthur Levine, students are spending less time on campuses because 40 per cent of them attend part time jobs while taking classes. This means we have less time to mess around, but in spite of this, daring creative initiatives keep flourishing, like Sam Bell and the Genocide Intervention Network from Swarthmore College trying to buy unmanned aerial vehicles to stop the genocide in Darfur.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Maybe our issues to fight for have lost that veil of idealism which attracted the attention of a nation long ago, but they have gained realism and issue-oriented focus. If students working at a shelter for the homeless or tutoring troubled newcomers won’t make national headlines, it will surely bloom into more pragmatic results than just pursuing Let Freedom Ring ideals. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Last but not least, campuses around the nation are finally fulfilling the diversity society seems to be asking for. That’s another silent lead. Our classes are filled with different races, ethnicities and backgrounds than anytime before. As a matter of fact, You Tube was created by a Taiwanese, a German and an American. These are the leading qualities the ongoing generations are being provided by the genuine role of college as we used to understand it.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Over-optimistic and self-complacent though they may sound, these are the signs of our time.</p>
