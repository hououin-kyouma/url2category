color:navy">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style="font-size:9.0pt;color:navy">If you fail or refuse to learn your God-given purpose, your options automatically become: (a) your own personal vision for your life, (b) society's vision for your life, or (c) the devil's vision for your life. With these plans, you may experience great financial success, but in the end, none of these visions will bring you fulfillment, satisfaction or peace of mind, (See Proverbs 19:21).</span></p> <p><b><font color="#000066">You Don't Find Your Purpose - You Learn It!<br> </font></b>You don't find your God-given purpose anymore than you find mathematics or aerodynamics. To find means to come upon, often by accident. When it comes to mathematics or aerodynamics, you learn them! You do the same with your God-give purpose. You learn it! Here is the first crucial point to learning your God-given purpose: God hid His purpose for your life deep within the recesses of your heart. </p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <p><b><font color="#000066">Proverbs 20:5</font></b><font color="#000066"><br> <span style="font-size:9.0pt;
color:navy">Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.</span> </font></p> 
              </blockquote> <p>In order to draw His purpose out of your heart, you must be a man or woman of understanding. I'll show you how to become that man or that woman! Using the illustration of a man drawing water from a well, the Lord makes another crucial point. If you don't draw out your God-given purpose from deep within your heart, you will never learn it. He goes on to say.</p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <p><font color="#000066"><b>Proverbs 20:18</b><br> <span style="font-size:9.0pt;
color:navy">Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.</span></font> </p> 
              </blockquote> <p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
">Without proper counsel, you will not be able to learn your God-given purpose. During my senior year of high school, my guidance counselor was a nice lady. She was intelligent, had a college degree and had comprehensive training to assist students make life-altering career decisions. </span></p> <p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
">She said my test scores revealed that law school, electrical engineering or the Air Force was best for me. </span></p> <p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
">The problem with her professional assessment. </span></p> <p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
">As sincere as she was, she was not my designer or manufacturer. She had no idea what I was capable of because she was not the one who installed the gifts, talents and abilities within me. </span></p> <p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
">To ask any man or woman, including your parents, to tell you what your God-given purpose is, is like asking the Ford Motor Company, "What is the purpose and capabilities of a B-2 Spirit&nbsp;Stealth Bomber?" The folks at Ford have some sharp minds, but they cannot answer that question for one reason. </span></p> <p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
">They did not design or manufacture that aircraft. </span></p> <p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
">If you want to know your God-given purpose, you must go to your manufacturer, (See Genesis 1:27 and Genesis 2:7). </span></p> <p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
">When the Lord God created us, He gave each of us an operator's manual. It is called the Bible - the Written Word of God. </span></p> <p class="MsoHeader"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
">Our operator's manual tells us which counselor to inquire of concerning this critical issue.</span></p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <p><b><font color="#000066">Isaiah 9:6 [Emphasis added]</font></b><br> <span style="font-size:9.0pt;
color:navy">For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called <b>Wonderful, Counsellor,</b> The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</span> </p> 
              </blockquote> <p>Our counselor is none other than the Lord God Almighty! </p> <p>He is not just any counselor. Read Isaiah 9:6 again! He is our Wonderful Counsellor! He is the only one who can reveal to us our God-given purpose.</p> <p>When you seek His counsel, there is no possibility of you failing in life because His counsel is excellent in working, (See Isaiah 28:29). Read how the prophet Habakkuk sought out the Wonderful Counsellor, became a man of understanding and got clear on his God-given vision.</p>

When you ask the Lord those questions, He will always answer you, (See Matthew 7:7).</p> <p>How long will He take? </p> <p>He will answer you immediately, but how you hear Him depends on your level of spiritual growth and development, (See Hebrews 5:13-14).</p> <p>The people who are attentive, quick to listen, quick to obey, quick to forgive and quick to repent, effortlessly hear God's voice and act on His Word, (See Mark 4:20). </p> <p>The people who are distracted, slow to listen, slow to obey, slow to forgive and slow to repent, have a harder time hearing from God, (See Mark 4:14-19).</p> <p>After praying that prayer, you need to analyze and take inventory of your gifts, talents and abilities.</p> <p><b><font color="#000066">Your Gifts, Talents and Abilities Help To Define Your Purpose</font></b> </p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <p><b><font color="#000066">Romans 11:29</font></b><br> <span style="color:navy">For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</span> </p> 
              </blockquote> <p>Prior to your birth, God installed in you all of the necessary gifts, talents and abilities you would need to fulfill his purpose for your life. Those gifts, talents and abilities help define your purpose. </p> <p>I have traveled to the Bering Sea on a number of occasions. I have been there when it was so cold, when you breathed, your breath would instantly freeze and fall to the ground. With the proper protective clothing, a human being could withstand that type of cold, but only for a short period of time. </p> <p>Polar bears, however, are superbly adapted for survival in that type of freezing weather. They are so well insulated that they experience almost no heat loss. They can withstand temperatures of minus 37 degrees Fahrenheit. Because of their insulation, they tend to overheat in warm weather. </p> <p>They cool down by diving into the ice-cold waters. Polar bears are champion swimmers. Using their partially webbed forepaws, they have been clocked swimming as fast as six miles per hour. They also have excellent underwater vision. Scientists tell us that polar bears can spot food up to 15 feet away while submerged. </p> <p>BUT! If you take the Polar Bears from the Far North and place them in the Sahara Desert, they will eventually die prematurely. The gifts, callings and abilities of the Polar Bear are ideally suited for the Far North, not the Sahara Desert. </p> <p>The Polar Bear's heavy insulating fur and thick blubber layer was made for the ice cold, not the heat. </p> <p>The Polar Bear's swimming abilities, fur, blubber, webbed forepaws and its ability to withstand extreme cold, help to define its purpose.</p> <p>It is the same way with everything! </p> <p>The wings of the eagle reveal that the eagle was made to fly. The eyes of the owl reveal that it is more suited to hunt at night. The anatomy of the fish - the scales, slime coat, gills, ventral, pectoral and dorsal fins, and fact that they have no arms, legs or wings, reveals that they were designed for the water.</p> <p><b><font color="#000066">How Were You Designed?<br> </font></b>What do you like to do? Solve mathematical problems? Play chess? Sing? Create music? Write? Build things? Invent things? Paint? Design things? Are you artistically inclined? Do you have a love for biology, nature or medicine? Do you have an analytical mind? Are you mechanically inclined? Are you a bookworm? Do you enjoy baking? Do you like to teach or train people? Do you love working with children? Do you like watching attorneys litigate? Do you have an inquisitive investigative mind? Do you love to make delectable culinary dishes? </p> <p><font color="#000066"><b>What You Naturally Gravitate Towards - Helps Reveal Your Purpose</b><br> </font>I started writing poetry when I was in grade school. I can't explain it. One day I picked up a pen and paper and just started writing in a romantic flow. By the time I reached high school, people were paying me to write poetry for their wives, girlfriends and special events. </p> <p>I noticed something else while in high school. I had this knack for training others. That gift carried over into the corporate arena. I spent over fifteen years training individuals during my corporate days. But even after I saw the success of the men and women who sat under my tutelage, something was still missing. I was not fulfilled.</p> <p>The problem?</p> <p>I was fulfilling (<i>my vision</i>) for my life and not my God-given purpose!</p> <p>The Lord put within me the gifts, talents and abilities to hone and fashion men and women to find and fulfill their God-given purpose. I could not fully accomplish my God-given purpose, while training people to analyze circuits. I was in the Far North but I was designed for the tropical weather! Once I learned my God-given purpose, my life completely changed. It became fulfilling and satisfying! I have no greater joy than being able to help God's people walk in the Truth and fulfill His purpose for their lives! </p> <b><font color="#000066">What Happens After You Learn Your God-Given Purpose?<br> </font></b>Once you know your God-given purpose and have taken inventory of your gifts, talents and abilities, go for it with all of your might! 
              <blockquote>

              </blockquote> <p>What is the Lord saying? Don't take your gifts, talents and abilities to the grave! Get busy about fulfilling His purpose for your life! Give it all that you've got!</p> <p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
