          <hr> 
          <h3>When the Dark Clouds Roll In: Facing (and Surviving) the Storm of Diagnosis</h3> 
          <p>My daughter started struggling with anxiety and panic disorder during her sophomore year in college.</p> 
          <p>At first I thought it was just normal college stress, but when I got a call from my daughter’s roommate that Paige was “not OK,” I felt the world as I knew it begin to crash down around me.</p> 
          <p>Paige had always been the most emotionally steady of all&nbsp;five of my kids. Responsible and even-tempered, she was a hard&nbsp;worker and calm problem-solver—a drama-free, easygoing kid&nbsp;who seemed mature beyond her years.</p> 
          <p>But this time she was truly not OK, and it was not just&nbsp;normal stress. Thus began our journey into a territory called&nbsp;“mental illness” that I struggled to wrap my head around. I couldn’t bring myself to say the words “mental illness” without wanting to choke.</p> 
          <p><em>She was anxious—not mentally ill—I kept telling myself. She’ll&nbsp;snap out of it and be fine.</em></p> 
          <p>After wrestling with doubt and denial, I then battled with&nbsp;guilt and fear. I wondered if I’d done something in her life that&nbsp;had caused this, and I was terrified what this meant for her&nbsp;future. The stigma of the words mental illness was so real and&nbsp;scary. I feared others would judge or reject her.</p> 
          <p>I wanted to fix it and dove into research to try to&nbsp;understand what might be causing my daughter’s anxiety and&nbsp;panic attacks—and how we could make it go away. I hoped we&nbsp;could find a simple cure like changing her diet and having her&nbsp;take supplements; perhaps she just needed vitamin D from a&nbsp;good dose of sunshine.</p> 
          <p><span style="color: #0000ff"><a href="https://www.mylifetree.com/soulfeed/"><strong><em>Related: Send much-needed soul-encouragement to your college student with a Soulfeed care package</em></strong></a></span></p> 
          <p>In the meantime, I got her connected with an incredible&nbsp;therapist—a woman I knew and deeply trusted. The therapist&nbsp;was licensed to give counseling sessions through a webcam so&nbsp;my daughter could access her conveniently.</p> 
          <p>The more I researched, the more I began to understand&nbsp;today’s huge epidemic of anxiety and depression—and how&nbsp;rampant it is with kids as well as adults. College is often the&nbsp;time the state of one’s mental health is revealed. My daughter&nbsp;wasn’t crazy, nor was she alone.</p> 
          <p>But this problem was big and it&nbsp;was for real.</p> 
          <p>Her anxiety gave me anxiety, as I felt so utterly helpless and&nbsp;ignorant about how to help her.&nbsp;So, naturally, once I’d gotten to the point of complete&nbsp;despair, I remembered to reach out to God.</p>

          <p>Only in God’s presence did I find comfort and relief. I was&nbsp;reminded that he had created her exactly as she was, and he&nbsp;doesn’t make mistakes. I knew the path of her life was planned&nbsp;by him, and he was alongside her.</p> 
          <p>I shared with Paige&nbsp;about how I’d found hope in&nbsp;God’s presence, and we both journeyed in this truth for the&nbsp;next 10 months, discovering the meaning of “peace that passes&nbsp;all understanding.”</p> 
          <p>Through the ongoing process of managing her condition,&nbsp;my daughter not only survived, she thrived. It was not easy.&nbsp;There were days she struggled. But she no longer tried to hide&nbsp;her anxiety and pretend everything was fine.</p> 
          <p>The diagnosis I’d once thought was life-shattering turned&nbsp;out to be the opposite. It gave her the freedom to pursue her mental, physical, and spiritual health from a place of honesty. Her faith grew deeper&nbsp;and her sense of purpose and identity was reframed by rooting&nbsp;herself to Christ.&nbsp;<strong>Through what was once a sense of being “broken” she’d discovered the truth of her wholeness.</strong></p> 
          <p>And I realized she was stronger and more&nbsp;confident than ever.</p> 
          <p><em>Little did I know how much she’d need this for what&nbsp;would come next…</em></p>

          <h3>When it Rains: Facing (and Surviving) the Storm of Disappointment</h3> 
          <p>Shortly before her diagnosis during her sophomore year,&nbsp;Paige had been accepted into a prestigious international study abroad&nbsp;program in which she would spend the second semester&nbsp;of her junior year on board a cruise ship traveling around&nbsp;the world. We allowed her to keep this trip a hopeful reality,&nbsp;something she could work toward and look forward to as she&nbsp;progressed in therapy.</p> 
          <p>As the study-abroad departure time grew closer, I started&nbsp;feeling <em>my</em> anxiety and fear increase. She’d be gone for four&nbsp;months, on a boat, visiting 11 countries. She’d be rooming&nbsp;with one of her best friends since childhood, which eased my&nbsp;worries somewhat—but I couldn’t shake the uneasiness that&nbsp;I felt. I spoke with her therapist, and she assured me that Paige&nbsp;was fine to go. She’d also still be able to continue on with her&nbsp;therapy sessions as needed through internet webcam.</p> 
          <p>Despite my worry, Paige was thrilled to be going on this&nbsp;program abroad. She meticulously planned all the details&nbsp;herself, getting vaccinations and travel visas for the various&nbsp;countries as well as a scholarship and a student loan to help pay&nbsp;the expenses. She moved all of her things back home at winter&nbsp;break since she’d sublet her room for second semester.</p> 
          <p>On December 21, just 10 days before she was supposed&nbsp;to depart on the program’s ship, my phone rang. It was my&nbsp;daughter, crying hysterically.</p> 
          <p>“I just got a call from the director,” she sobbed. “They&nbsp;reviewed my health records and told me I’m unfit to sail!&nbsp;They’re pulling me off the trip!”</p> 
          <p><em>And once again I felt the world as we’d known it begin to&nbsp;crash in around us.</em></p> 
          <p><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Release-My-Grip-Parent-s-Heart/dp/1470748479/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486499699&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=release+my+grip"><em>Related: Get the companion devotion to this story in the new best-selling book, Release My Grip: Hope for a Parent’s Heart as Kids Leave the Nest and Learn to Fly</em></a></strong></span></p> 
          <p>I told her to call her therapist immediately,&nbsp;and I would call the program director. We could surely work&nbsp;this out.</p> 
          <p>Despite a conference call which included the program’s&nbsp;director and head doctor, myself, and Paige’s therapist, they&nbsp;refused to change their decision.&nbsp;Paige had filled out her medical background honestly,&nbsp;including her struggle and diagnosis with generalized anxiety&nbsp;disorder. Earlier in the fall a medical professional from the&nbsp;program had called her after reviewing her file to inquire if she&nbsp;was on any medication. When she said she was not, the medical&nbsp;professional recommended she get a prescription for anxiety&nbsp;“just in case.”</p> 
          <p>Unfortunately, that advice was now the problem. When&nbsp;Paige submitted the final medical paperwork—including her&nbsp;new prescription which she had filled in early December—it&nbsp;raised a red flag. There was a strict rule that students&nbsp;weren’t allowed&nbsp;to set sail&nbsp;if they had been prescribed medication for a mental health&nbsp;issue within a certain time period before departure.</p> 
          <p>I was in shock. Her&nbsp;world had just been torn apart…all&nbsp;because of her anxiety diagnosis. It seemed cruel that a program&nbsp;that was so concerned about her well-being on the trip&nbsp;would brutally cast her off as a liability a mere 10 days before&nbsp;departure, leaving her behind to pick up the pieces of her life.</p> 
          <p>Paige&nbsp;had no college classes scheduled for second semester since&nbsp;her full course load would have occurred through the program&nbsp;on board the ship. She’d quit her job in anticipation of studying abroad. She no longer had a place on campus to live. And most&nbsp;of&nbsp;her friends were going abroad to various places that semester.</p> 
          <p><em>She was alone and without a plan.</em></p> 
          <p>I was in full panic mode. What would this do to her?&nbsp;Would this spin her backward and cause her to spiral into a&nbsp;deep depression or anxiety-fueled breakdown? Would she now&nbsp;only see herself as a liability—unfit to be out in the world with&nbsp;her peers?</p> 
          <p>I cried. I raged. I begged God to make the people at the&nbsp;study-abroad program change their minds and tell us it was all&nbsp;a silly mistake. I dropped to the floor of my bedroom in utter&nbsp;despair and grief for what this could do to my daughter’s mental&nbsp;health and well being…and then I suddenly felt awash with God’s peace.</p> 
          <p>It was as if I could hear him say,<em>&nbsp;“I am here—and I have other&nbsp;plans. Better ones. Trust me, you’ll see.”</em></p> 
          <p>At that moment Paige&nbsp;pulled into the driveway, and&nbsp;I ran to hug her. I held her, and we cried for a minute. Then&nbsp;I told her&nbsp;that I believed that when things go so crazy off&nbsp;course it could only be the hand of God pointing to somewhere&nbsp;better.</p> 
          <p>Her heartfelt response was, “I know. He’s been telling&nbsp;me the same thing. I think he has a different adventure in&nbsp;mind for me.”</p>

          <h4>A Ray of&nbsp;Light in the Darkness</h4> 
          <p>A week later she found an international organization&nbsp;that placed volunteers in remote places all over the world to&nbsp;serve in impoverished areas. She was accepted into a 10-week&nbsp;program to teach elementary school in a remote village on the&nbsp;east coast of Fiji.</p> 
          <p>And on January 21, 2016—exactly one month after Paige had&nbsp;been disqualified as a liability for sailing around the world&nbsp;on her study-abroad program, we stood in the airport and&nbsp;hugged goodbye.</p> 
          <p>All of her belongings were packed in a large hiking pack&nbsp;that was almost the same size as she was. She looked like a tiny&nbsp;child on her first day of school. Excited but quite nervous, she turned to me as she got to the security line and said, “I’ve never&nbsp;traveled alone.”</p> 
          <p>“You’re not alone,” I reminded her. “God is with you. He&nbsp;brought you on this journey for his purpose, and he is with you&nbsp;every step. Just reach for his hand and you’ll know.”</p>

          <p>As I drove home from the airport, I briefly wondered if&nbsp;this was a good decision. She’d been turned away as a medical&nbsp;risk from a program on a well-equipped cruise ship with the&nbsp;security of staff doctors and psychologists aboard. Now she&nbsp;was venturing off across the world all alone. She’d be living in a&nbsp;grass hut in a poor village that had the barest of necessities.</p> 
          <p><strong><em>But I had peace that it was God’s plan.</em></strong></p> 
          <p>Once she was in Fiji I heard from her weekly when she&nbsp;was able to get a local SIM card for her phone. She messaged&nbsp;me pictures of the mat she slept on, her bedding infested with&nbsp;bedbugs. Her legs were covered in festering sores and tropical&nbsp;ulcers from mosquito bites, and her hair was crawling with&nbsp;lice. She’d been having some bad headaches lately that made&nbsp;me worried.</p> 
          <p>I secretly wondered if her anxiety was beginning to rear its ugly head again.</p>

           <p class="wp-caption-text">Paige experiencing the joy of teaching in Silana Village before the storm</p>
          </div> 
          <p>But she had fallen in love with the kids she was teaching in “her home” of &nbsp;Silana Village. In an Instagram post on February 15th she said: “I came to teach them, but they are the ones teaching me.”</p> 
          <p>She also developed a deep bond with the host family in the&nbsp;village. She called her host mom “Na” and host dad “Ta,” and&nbsp;she felt safe, loved, and accepted. And she was excited to be making a&nbsp;difference in people’s lives.</p> 
          <h3>When it Pours: Facing (and Surviving) the Storm…Literally</h3> 
          <p>On February 20, one month after I’d said goodbye&nbsp;to her at the airport, I got an urgent message from her. My&nbsp;heart leaped into my throat as I read her words:</p> 
          <blockquote>
           <p>“Don’t freak out, but there’s a Category 5 tropical cyclone&nbsp;headed our way. We’re securing the village. If things get too bad,&nbsp;we will evacuate to Suva. Pray for my family here.”</p>
          </blockquote>

           <p class="wp-caption-text">Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston (Credit: New Zealand Meteorological Service)</p>
          </div> 
          <p>I immediately went online to search for news about the&nbsp;storm, subscribing to every internet feed for weather in that&nbsp;part of the world. The radar introduced me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Winston">Severe Tropical&nbsp;Cyclone Winston</a>—a giant mass of red and purple making&nbsp;its way toward Fiji. It was being called the “perfect storm”—&nbsp;unfolding the worst possible case scenario.</p> 
          <p>And it was aiming for a direct hit on Fiji, predicted to make&nbsp;landfall on the east coast of the island—exactly where my daughter’s&nbsp;village was located.</p> 
          <p>Her world was about to come crashing down again—<em>literally</em>—and potentially right on top of her.</p> 
          <p>“Get out of the village! Get everyone out of the village! THIS STORM IS HUGE AND IT COMING STRAIGHT AT YOU!” I quickly messaged her&nbsp;back. “Evacuate NOW!”</p> 
          <p>“We’ll go if it gets bad enough,” she calmly messaged&nbsp;back. “Right now&nbsp;we’re focused on keeping the villagers safe. Just pray. And don’t&nbsp;panic if you don’t hear from me right away because phone and internet&nbsp;lines on the whole island might be down.”</p> 
          <p>I prayed like I’ve never prayed before. I also reached out to&nbsp;every group of prayer warriors I knew and asked them to pray.&nbsp;In between praying I watched the weather radar with&nbsp;fascinated horror.</p> 
          <p>The storm grew bigger and meaner. Severe&nbsp;Tropical Cyclone Winston now had sustained wind speeds of 175&nbsp;mph and gusts over 190 mph. It was now being labeled the&nbsp;most intense tropical cyclone to ever make landfall in the&nbsp;southern hemisphere—<strong><em>the second most intense storm ever&nbsp;recorded in the history of the world.</em></strong></p> 
          <p><em>And it was headed for landfall in the exact spot my daughter was located.</em></p> 
          <p>Perhaps it was shock, but despite the impending drama I felt a deep peace I couldn’t&nbsp;explain. I like to call it God, because I felt it with such certainty.&nbsp;This was all in his plan; he was holding Paige in the palm of his&nbsp;hand. She would endure the storm with him, and somehow good would&nbsp;come.</p> 
          <p>My heart held on to this.</p> 
          <p>For the next 24 hours I watched the internet news reports as&nbsp;Cyclone Winston tore directly into&nbsp;the island of Fiji engulfing the&nbsp;entire country, followed by a massive storm surge on the coastal areas. As the storm passed I searched the aerial news footage of the aftermath on the island. Destruction was everywhere. Silana Village was now&nbsp;nothing but a rubble of cinder blocks. The palm trees were&nbsp;bare. The grass huts where Paige and the&nbsp;volunteers lived in were gone. I couldn’t&nbsp;imagine how anyone had even survived.</p>

          <p>Paige finally contacted me later that night, her voice calm but&nbsp;concerned. She and her team of eight volunteers had evacuated&nbsp;at the last minute and made it to a small youth hostel in Fiji’s&nbsp;capital city of Suva. The storm had ripped the roof partially off&nbsp;right over their heads, and they had hunkered down all night&nbsp;under mattresses in the small lobby.</p> 
          <p>“Mom, I don’t know if the people of my village are OK. The&nbsp;roads are washed out…we can’t get to them. Please pray!” she&nbsp;said, now crying softly.</p> 
          <p>I was so relieved she was alive and safe, but unsure what&nbsp;was next. I learned it would be at least a week or more&nbsp;until the&nbsp;airport was usable for commercial flights. I wouldn’t be able&nbsp;to bring her home from this right now, and there was nothing&nbsp;I could do.</p> 
          <p><em>I could only wait, pray, and trust God.</em></p>

          <p>For the next several weeks we remained in steady contact.&nbsp;She and her team of volunteers were working with local agency&nbsp;relief efforts and doing online fundraising campaigns to help&nbsp;rebuild their village.&nbsp;They were all living in one little bunk room in the hostel.&nbsp;They had small rations of fresh water and cans of beans, and&nbsp;they had contracted some sort of stomach virus that made&nbsp;life even rougher.</p> 
          <p>But every time I talked with Paige, she&nbsp;could only talk about her village and her desire to go back and&nbsp;help rebuild.</p> 
          <p>“I’m NOT&nbsp;coming home!” she declared. “I need to extend my&nbsp;stay because I need to get back to Silana&nbsp;Village and show them&nbsp;I didn’t leave them behind. I NEED to see my Na and make sure&nbsp;she’s OK. God sent me here to serve, and they need me more&nbsp;than ever.”</p>

           <p class="wp-caption-text">The first news Paige&nbsp;received of her host family’s&nbsp;survival&nbsp;was from a photo in the Fiji Times featuring&nbsp;the kids of Silana Village.</p>
          </div> 
          <p>I wasn’t going to argue with her direction from God, so we&nbsp;extended her stay for another month. She and her team were finally able to go back to the village in March, and they’d already&nbsp;raised enough funding from donors to begin to rebuild.</p> 
          <p>The only structure that remained somewhat intact in Silana&nbsp;Village was the school, which now housed the 200 homeless villagers.&nbsp;Despite the area’s catastrophic loss of life, limb,&nbsp;livestock, crops, and homes, the stories being shared were ones&nbsp;of miraculous survival and gratitude.</p> 
          <p>Paige marveled at the resilience of these people and how&nbsp;they were still full of joy and hope. The kids still played in the&nbsp;puddles, and the men and women of the village went straight to the task of rebuilding their homes, singing the traditional&nbsp;Fijian songs of their heritage.</p>

           <p class="wp-caption-text">Paige reuniting with her “Na” (host mother)</p>

          <p>“When I saw my Na, she ran to me, screaming my name,”&nbsp;Paige shared. “As she hugged me, she sobbed into my neck&nbsp;and kept saying, ‘Thank you, thank you.’ I asked what she was&nbsp;thanking me for and she said, <em>‘For coming back to me, Lewa!’”</em></p> 
          <p>“My Na was so happy that her whole family was safe,” Paige&nbsp;marveled, “and she was&nbsp;also one of the lucky ones, because some of the walls of her house were still standing after the storm.”</p> 
          <p>And with that, I suddenly realized why God had sent her&nbsp;there. She and the villagers had faced the worst storm imaginable and survived.</p> 
          <p>The world as they knew it had come crashing down around&nbsp;them—even the walls caved in.</p> 
          <p><em>But not all was lost.</em></p> 
          <p>Despite&nbsp;the terror of the cyclone and the hardships that resulted from&nbsp;it, peace, love,&nbsp;and hope remained.</p>

           <p>And I knew, without a doubt, this experience had taught my&nbsp;daughter a profound lesson about anxiety, resilience, and God’s goodness:&nbsp;<strong>No matter how bad things get, when the storms rage and the&nbsp;world comes crashing down, God has a plan. Do not be afraid—just reach for his hand. He will not release his grip.</strong></p>
          </blockquote> 
          <p>It was a lesson she could only truly understand with the&nbsp;perspective gained from having lived through it. She had a new experience of being a survivor…surrounded by other survivors&nbsp;who were picking up the pieces and soldiering on.</p> 
          <p>And it was a lesson I, too, had needed to learn as a mother.</p> 
          <p>The world as we know it will sometimes come crashing down;&nbsp;it’s just how life works. And one of the worst feelings a parent can experience&nbsp;is not being able to protect our kids from the pain that surrounds this tumultuous life.</p> 
          <p>Trusting God through the storm is&nbsp;the only way to survive it.</p> 
          <p><em>(Especially if you’re a parent watching it all&nbsp;unfold on your child as you sit helplessly on the other side of the planet.)</em></p>

          <p>I could hear it in her voice. Beneath the conversation was an undertone that only parent radar could pick up on. <strong>She was down.</strong> Not in a concerning way, but I could detect a hint of melancholy as she told me about her day.</p> 
          <p>This was a four years ago, and it was my daughter’s first semester of college. She’d made it through her “firsts:” first time meeting her roommate, first meals in the dining hall, first classes, first campus events. The novelty of all these new experiences had been carrying her on a wave of adrenaline, and her previous calls had all been upbeat. But now it was toward the end of her third&nbsp;week and <strong>reality was setting in.</strong></p> 
          <p>Keeping my tone light, I carefully asked questions and listened to what she said. More importantly, I noticed what she <em>didn’t</em>&nbsp;say. Though she was surrounded by new people, I could tell she was lonely. And though she was excited about her new home, she was homesick for her old one. She was feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;lost and disconnected.</p> 
          <p>Of course I knew she’d feel this way sometime (though I was a little surprised by how fast it happened). Even happy life changes are stressful, and this was <em>big</em> life change.&nbsp;Loneliness and homesickness were also normal. (I probably would have been hurt if she hadn’t been a bit homesick) So I encouraged her as best I could, and hung up feeling worried&nbsp;by the gap between us.</p> 
          <h3>To whom do you tether?</h3> 
          <p>I remembered this feeling because it was exactly like what I’d felt during her first days of elementary school. Like it was yesterday, I could picture her sitting on the lunch bench in the cafeteria, her tiny legs swinging off the edge—too short even to touch the ground. I saw her quietly opening her lunch bag and eating her sandwich, observing the new faces around her.&nbsp;A mixture of shy and yet curious, she was like a small flower—full of sweet wonder and vulnerability.</p> 
          <p>Fast forward twelve years and I felt that not much had changed. As her slightly melancholy voice still hung in the air from our call, I could picture her sitting on her dorm bed, feet hanging off the edge, her hair in a messy bun on her head. She was probably biting her nails—she always did that when she was feeling unsettled. And though she was technically an adult now, she <em>still</em> seemed like a small flower to me—<em>still</em> full of sweet wonder and vulnerability.</p> 
          <p>I fought the urge&nbsp;to jump in the car and check on her, because&nbsp;I wanted her to learn how to navigate these young adult years with confidence and independence from me. But I knew she still needed&nbsp;ongoing&nbsp;encouragement and support, some sort of reminder that she was known and loved.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I remembered that when she was six-years-old, I’d put a note in her lunch box every day during that first year. It wasn’t much, but it felt like a love-tether, reaching out from me to encourage her in a new place.</p> 
          <p>That’s what she&nbsp;needs, I thought.<strong> She needs<em>&nbsp;another&nbsp;love-tether.&nbsp;</em></strong></p> 
          <p><a href="https://soulfeed.cratejoy.com/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2252 size-full" src="https://2df6ifl6qf726uflde5e28ya-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/soulfeed/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/nourish-their-faith-as-they-spread-their-wings-7-1.jpg" alt="" width="950" height="520" srcset="https://2df6ifl6qf726uflde5e28ya-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/soulfeed/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/nourish-their-faith-as-they-spread-their-wings-7-1.jpg 950w, https://2df6ifl6qf726uflde5e28ya-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/soulfeed/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/nourish-their-faith-as-they-spread-their-wings-7-1-300x164.jpg 300w, https://2df6ifl6qf726uflde5e28ya-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/soulfeed/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/nourish-their-faith-as-they-spread-their-wings-7-1-768x420.jpg 768w, https://2df6ifl6qf726uflde5e28ya-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/soulfeed/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/nourish-their-faith-as-they-spread-their-wings-7-1-705x386.jpg 705w, https://2df6ifl6qf726uflde5e28ya-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/soulfeed/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/nourish-their-faith-as-they-spread-their-wings-7-1-450x246.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px"></a></p> 
          <p>But&nbsp;then&nbsp;the voice of my “inner mean girl” started whispering words of condemnation. “Cut the cord” “Don’t be a helicopter parent” “It’s time to let go—she’s not six years old anymore.”</p> 
          <p>I wrestled with doubt,&nbsp;trying to navigate&nbsp;the&nbsp;maternal turmoil of &nbsp;how to appropriately support and encourage her—how to keep her connected&nbsp;with a&nbsp;love-tether that wasn’t a leash.&nbsp;After all, my job as a parent was to raise a daughter who could survive in a world without me. And then I realized an important truth:</p> 
          <p><strong><em>She didn’t need another tether to me, she needed&nbsp;a tether to God.</em></strong></p> 
          <p>Suddenly I understood <a href="http://soulfeed.com">why people sent care packages.</a> They were sending <em>care</em>. In that moment, I SO wanted to send her all of the care, love and encouragement that filled my heart. But even more than care, I wanted to send her a something more solid and meaningful that she could grasp onto for herself as she was entering the world as an independent young adult. &nbsp;<strong>I wanted to send her hope…the kind of hope that comes from faith and trusting God.</strong></p> 
          <p>I wanted her to know that I believed in her and how God was working in her life—and because of this truth she could be brave in her new&nbsp;world.</p> 
          <p>And I wanted to remind her that although she felt lost and unknown without the comfort of family and close friends, that &nbsp;she wasn’t alone—she had Jesus right beside her, and that he would lead and guide her through every step in this new chapter.</p> 
          <p>It took me a more than a week&nbsp;to get my package together as I tried to find the right devotional book <em>(would she even have time to read a book???</em>); or an inspirational keepsake <em>(something that wasn’t cheesy???)</em> and some fun items to brighten her day. I frantically&nbsp;scrambled&nbsp;some things together, and finally declared victory when I was standing in line at the post office with the care package.<em> (And then I realized that the cost of shipping&nbsp;this box&nbsp;was more than the cost of the contents! Lord have mercy!!!!)</em></p> 
          <p>I wish I’d been more prepared. And I wish there&nbsp;was something I could have done&nbsp;that provided more God-tethering encouragement on a consistent basis.&nbsp;Even the following year—her sophomore year—when she was battling increasing issues with anxiety and the pressures of living and working off campus and taking harder classes, I was still unprepared how to support her—possibly even more so. She’d found her tribe of close friends, but most weren’t believers and she felt awkward talking about “religion” or seeking out Christian community with others. I knew she&nbsp;still needed guidance and faith-nourishment&nbsp;but I wasn’t sure how to continually deliver spiritual encouragement without drowning her with more pressure or awkwardness.</p> 
          <p><b><i>“Lord, now what?” </i>I prayed…</b></p> 
          <p>From my struggle as a parent trying to figure out how to appropriately nurture my young adult’s faith journey, God laid an idea on my heart that’s become my driving passion. <a href="https://www.mylifetree.com/soulfeed/">SoulFeed College Care Packages</a> were born from my heartfelt desire to consistently feed kids’ faith during college, and also help other parents have a resource to do the same. And because God does abundantly more than we could ever imagine, I was able to gather a core team of college ministry leaders to help create a series of simple, powerful devotions just for college students, along with some college interns to explore and curate the yummiest healthy snack options and super-cool practical items and surprises.</p> 
          <p>We launched in the fall of 2015 with a line-up of 8 unique monthly care packages themed around the most common issues college students face throughout first and second semester. Each year we create and curate new boxes with new snacks, surprises, devotions and themes, and we recently added a new “get well soon” SoulFeed care package that can be sent anytime.</p> 
          <p>It’s been two years since the launch of <a href="https://www.mylifetree.com/soulfeed/">SoulFeed</a>&nbsp;and we now reach thousands of students each month. Last year my son entered his freshman year of college, but this time I was relieved that I had an easy way to channel my love and support but still foster his dependence and confidence in God. He received a <a href="https://www.mylifetree.com/soulfeed/">Soulfeed Care Packag</a>e every month from me that nourished his soul and&nbsp;helped him continue to&nbsp;grow his&nbsp;faith and develop a relationship with Jesus that was truly his own. I believe the simple nudge of faith-based encouragement also motivated his desire to keep growing spiritually and get connected with a campus Bible study. By second semester of freshman year, my introverted son who’d always ditched youth group in high school was actually <em>leading</em> a Bible study. I was thrilled <em>(and floored)</em> and grateful that he never experienced the sense of loneliness and disconnection that my daughter had felt. <em>(to God be the glory!)</em></p> 
          <p>Last week we helped him move into his off-campus house for his sophomore year. After we’d said our goodbyes <em>(no ugly-crying for me this year!)</em> I received a text that included his mailing address and the following words:</p> 
          <p><em><strong>“Here’s my new address. Will u still send me SoulFeed this year? That would be swag. Thx!”</strong></em></p>

          <h3>Lord have mercy—it’s the night before we take our son to college.</h3> 
          <p><strong>This is his&nbsp;last night in the&nbsp;bed that he’s slept in for the past 18 years.</strong></p> 
          <p><em>Release me from lurking&nbsp;around his bedroom,&nbsp;but I just need to tuck him in one last time. (And release me from my urge to crawl into bed with him because that would be super-weird.)</em></p> 
          <p><strong>The car is packed, and the gas tank is full. Everything seems to be ready for a smooth departure tomorrow.</strong></p> 
          <p><em>Release me from frantically running around the house in the morning like a crazed lunatic, looking for something I will be certain I’ve lost—because it’ll probably just be my mind. (Right now “leaving” and “losing” feels like the same thing.)</em></p> 
          <p><strong>Our &nbsp;parking permit is in hand&nbsp;and the residence hall move-in time is confirmed.</strong></p> 
          <p><em>Release me from feeling overwhelmed by the crowds and chaos of a thousand parents and students&nbsp; lugging around box fans and crates of&nbsp;bedding. (And please release the elevator from it’s ridiculous crawl, because I’m NOT&nbsp;walking up eight flights of stairs with a mini-fridge.)</em></p> 
          <p><strong>We’ll get him all moved in and unpacked.</strong></p> 
          <p><em>Release me from being an over-controlling, over-bearing “nester” who obsesses about storage space and knick-knack placement. (But Lord let me make his&nbsp;bed, I NEED TO MAKE THAT BED!)</em></p> 
          <p><strong>We’ll probably wander the campus a bit, maybe grab a bite to eat and stop by the bookstore.</strong></p> 
          <p><em>Release me from the urge in a moment of weakness from buying every coffee mug, bumper sticker, and clothing garments that say “MSU Mom.”</em></p>

          <p><strong>And then it will be time for me to leave.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Without him,&nbsp;</strong><strong>because he is staying there.</strong></p> 
          <p><em>Oh Lord, release me from the overwhelming grief I’m feeling right now, and replace it with hope and excitement for his new life.</em></p> 
          <p><em>Help me put one foot in front of the other and release my tears AFTER&nbsp;I make it to the car so I can ugly-cry on my steering wheel instead of making a scene in&nbsp;public.</em></p> 
          <p><em>Release me from being heartbroken if I don’t hear from him as often as I’d like. (And help me &nbsp;figure out Snapchat so I can stalk him on social media.)</em></p> 
          <p><em>Release me from worrying about things beyond my control—like falling off his loft bed, fraternity hazing, contracting meningitis, his refusal to use an umbrella,&nbsp;natural disasters, cult abduction and poor choices—and remind me that despite the inevitable challenges he’ll face that you’re directing his path.</em></p> 
          <p><em>Release me from feeling like motherhood is over and help me to find meaningful ways to stay connected and deepen my relationship with my son in this new season.</em></p> 
          <p><em>Release my grip when I hug him one last time and I don’t want to let go, and remind me I’ve raised a young man who’s ready to spread his wings.</em></p> 
          <p><strong>Oh…and one more thing, Lord: &nbsp;</strong></p> 
          <p><strong>Hold me tightly in your peace and comfort tomorrow, as I release him to you.</strong></p> 
          <p><em><strong>…even though he’s always been yours.</strong></em></p> 
          <h4>Lord, in your mercy, hear my prayer.</h4>

           <li>WHY does something in our house always stink like cheese?</li> 
           <li>WHY can’t I pee alone?</li> 
           <li>WHY has it become a household norm for our toddlers to be naked at the dinner table?</li> 
           <li>WHY does a child always end up sleeping in our bed, in a horizontal position between me and his dad, forming a human letter “H”?</li> 
          </ul> 
          <h3>Then came the teenage years, and my list of WHY’s had turned into:</h3> 
          <ul> 
           <li>WHY is asking “how was your day?” so offensive?</li> 
           <li>WHY have you stopped talking and now only communicate in grunts, snorts, and eye rolls?</li> 
           <li>WHY is Axe body spray a thing?</li> 
           <li>WHY does it take you 45 minutes in the shower? <em>(Never mind. I’d rather not know.)</em></li>

          <p><strong>Nowadays three of my kids are in (or entering into) college and young adulthood, and everyone is home for the summer. </strong></p> 
          <p><strong><em>Technically</em>. (</strong><strong>I rarely ever see them in person, but they certainly leave a trace.)</strong></p> 
          <h3>And I have a whole new list of WHY questions for my college-age kids that grows longer by the week:</h3> 
          <blockquote>
           <p>WHY is my grocery bill sky high but everyone complains there’s nothing to eat, and no one is ever home for dinner?</p> 
           <p>WHY can you keep up with Snapchat streaks but you can’t ever respond to texts from your mother?</p> 
           <p>WHY do you rant about a messy college roommate but still leave your dirty dishes, socks, fast food cups, etc. all over the house?</p> 
           <p>WHY do you put the milk carton back in the fridge with only a tiny swallow left?</p> 
           <p>WHY has our garage become the un-parkable catch-all storage unit for piles of hauled-home dorm room stuff and gross free furniture from Craigslist you’re saving for your future off-campus housing?</p> 
           <p>WHY do you miss the dogs so much during college but now no one has time to walk/feed/groom them?</p> 
           <p>WHY do you watch Netflix on your laptop in the family room instead of using the big fancy TV?</p> 
           <p>WHY do you claim to be an adult but revert to fetal position when you have to make appointments with the banker/doctor/dentist all by yourself?</p> 
           <p>WHY is having a curfew when you’re home for the summer such a travesty?</p> 
           <p>WHY is it so easy for you to take time off your job for a camping trip with friends but not for a family event?</p> 
           <p>WHY does your new hipster beard annoy me so much?</p> 
           <p>WHY are you so deeply perplexed by the US postal system?</p> 
           <p>WHY can’t I have nice things without them becoming yours?<em> (My makeup, my water bottle, my sunglasses, my jacket, my flip flops, my socks, my portable speaker, my razor, my special smoothie mix, my phone charger…)</em></p> 
           <p>WHY are you suddenly referring to your college town as “home?”</p> 
           <p>WHY do I get sappy and nostalgic when my eye catches the sight of your colorful elementary artwork creations that still plaster the walls of the laundry room?</p> 
           <p>WHY do I get fed up with you after a few weeks at the house…but still miss you like crazy when you leave again?</p> 
           <p>WHY do I sometimes still pause by your bedroom door in order to savor the sight of you sleeping in your bed?</p> 
           <p>WHY didn’t anyone ever tell me how hard this whole parenting thing is…and then how hard it is to let kids go when they grow up?</p> 
           <p><strong>And of course…why, <em>Dear God</em>,&nbsp;<em>WHY</em>—after two decades—have I STILL not figured out why my house smells like stinky cheese?</strong></p>

          <hr> 
          <h4>There are many precious “last time” moments and&nbsp;milestones with our kids that all parents&nbsp;celebrate with&nbsp;photos and fanfare.</h4> 
          <p>There are also the “last time moments”&nbsp;we quietly honor with a simple,&nbsp;searing acknowledgement of its sacredness.</p> 
          <p><em>And then there are the moments that slip by totally unnoticed.</em></p> 
          <p>They’re the mundane little things that are so routine they don’t land on our nostalgia radar until we suddenly notice one day that they’re over.</p> 
          <p><em>Did I know when it was the “official” last time that I carried my each of my children on my hip?</em></p> 
          <p>Because there WAS a very last time, and although hip-carrying instances dwindle down slowly over the years to the occasional sick or injured-kid-moment, there still was a single last time. My teenage son is now 6’1” and my go-to guy for carrying all things heavy. There’s no hip-carrying happening&nbsp;in our house anymore.</p> 
          <p>If I had thought about that while double-hipping two kids into the grocery store&nbsp;I might have been more patient.</p> 
          <p><em>But I didn’t pay attention.</em></p> 
          <blockquote>
           <p><strong><em>When was the official last time I ever pushed them in a stroller?</em></strong></p> 
           <p><strong><em>Or read them a book?</em></strong></p> 
           <p><strong><em>Or cut up their meat?</em></strong></p> 
           <p><strong><em>Or forgot to be the tooth fairy (again?)</em></strong></p>
          </blockquote> 
          <p>I’m not sure if I would have cheered or cried knowing when these ordinary parenting tasks were officially commanding their final performance, but I do know that the realization of not being present like I could’ve in my kids’ lives gives me a parenthood gut-check of guilt that haunts me too often.</p> 
          <p><strong>Last summer before my daughter started college, she started giving me “last time” countdowns to just about everything.</strong></p> 
          <p><a href="http://amzn.to/2sBG20O"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1614" src="https://2df6ifl6qf726uflde5e28ya-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/soulfeed/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/clown-post-ad-for-web.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="175" srcset="https://2df6ifl6qf726uflde5e28ya-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/soulfeed/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/clown-post-ad-for-web.jpg 600w, https://2df6ifl6qf726uflde5e28ya-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/soulfeed/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/clown-post-ad-for-web-300x88.jpg 300w, https://2df6ifl6qf726uflde5e28ya-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/soulfeed/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/clown-post-ad-for-web-450x131.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p> 
          <p>Not that I needed more nostalgic reminders at that point because I’d already gut-checked myself into a fetal position after watching her preschool graduation video the night after she graduated from high school.</p> 
          <p>I was frantic, wondering about the moments I’d missed in the last 18 years, and how it was suddenly over so fast.</p> 
          <p><strong>“Hey Mom, can you make me a grilled cheese and bring it to me in my room? It might be the LAST TIME before I leave for college.…”</strong> <em>(LIE. It was only June and she used that line at least 7 more times.)</em></p> 
          <p><strong>&nbsp;“Can we go back-to-school clothes shopping for the LAST TIME before I leave the nest</strong>?” <em>(LIE. She comes home during college&nbsp;breaks and she still hits me up for shopping.)</em></p> 
          <p>As I’m writing this, it’s now a year later, and she’s getting ready to go back to college in a few days. She doesn’t tease me with the “last time” reminders anymore, because we’ve transitioned to a new chapter realizing that there’s always an option for another last time.</p> 
          <p><strong>She’s grown up, but she hasn’t stopped being my daughter, and I haven’t stopped being her mother.</strong></p> 
          <p>And for now she leaves the nest and comes home again in a steady rhythm. It’s become a comfortable new season of parenting routine.</p> 
          <p>Truth?&nbsp;I’m loving&nbsp;this new season of parenting because it’s actually much more pleasant than some of her teenage years!</p> 
          <p>And when she’s home I still make her grilled cheese, take her shopping, and marvel at the amazing growth I’ve seen in her even over the last year. It’s not over, it’s just different—and I’m better at savoring it now.</p> 
          <p>I’ve learned the trick to this is battling guilt and grief with gratefulness.</p>

          <p><strong>What I know for sure is that looking back and feeling guilty or sad robs me of being present for the moment I’m in now. But looking back through the lens of gratitude makes the present even sweeter.&nbsp;</strong></p> 
          <p>And I’m no longer in a fetal position, which is healthy for everyone.</p>

          <p><strong>Every Mother’s Day I think back to when I was a little girl and my fantasy image of my future life as a grown-up.</strong></p> 
          <p>It looked a lot like my parents’ life: happily married for decades with a house full of kids.</p> 
          <p>Never once did I envision that by the age of 30 I’d be a divorced mother of three, or that a few years later I’d be remarried and the stepmother of two step kids. (Whom I love as much as my own.)</p> 
          <p>And never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I’d be sharing my own kids with a stepmother.</p> 
          <p><strong><em>This was not the picture in my head of what my life was supposed to look like. </em></strong></p> 
          <p>Today as I look at our extended family tree, it’s got so many extra branches it looks more like an overgrown vine. But I don’t see a tangled mess of weeds. I see a vine that’s beautiful, fruitful, and full.</p> 
          <p>Full of love, grace, chaos, wisdom, passion, and extra hearts and hands who embrace my kids and call them family.</p> 
          <p>It’s not always easy, and this doesn’t match what the world (or the church) typically celebrates as a picture of a “healthy” and “normal” family. But I refuse to be ashamed, because we’re not normal, and that’s OK. I recognize how rare, and how truly good our situation is. Somehow we’ve all found God’s love and grace through all of this, and learned to lean more on him.</p> 
          <p>For that, I’m grateful.</p> 
          <p><strong><em>And focusing on gratitude helps me embrace the reality of my motherhood with a heart that is full of this truth:</em></strong></p> 
          <h3>Our family is not broken—we are blended. And we are <em>blessed</em>.</h3> 
          <p><span style="color: #0000ff"><a style="color: #0000ff" href="https://www.mylifetree.com/shop/the-jesus-interruption/"><em>[related: Click here to see the new devotional book that the author of this article is gifting her kids’ stepmom for Mother’s Day!] </em></a></span></p> 
          <h4><strong>So this Mother’s Day I’m choosing to celebrate my kids’ stepmom with a letter thanking her for how she impacts the lives of my kids:</strong></h4> 
          <blockquote>
           <p><em>Dear Kari,</em></p> 
           <p><em>As the world celebrates mothers, I celebrate YOU—the stepmom of my kids—and the qualities you’re teaching them with the gift of your life in theirs:</em></p> 
           <ol> 
            <li><strong><em>Patience:</em></strong><em> You endured the awkward season of getting to know your husband’s insanely extroverted ex-wife and decided that showing up and being present on the sidelines of the kids’ sporting events mattered more than avoiding the situation. (I know it wasn’t easy.) <strong>Thank you.</strong></em></li> 
            <li><strong><em>Nurture:</em></strong><em> You are a true caretaker and a champion for the underdog. Whether it’s rescuing an animal in distress, volunteering your time to serve those less fortunate, or caring for a family member when they need you—you’re the kind of woman who’s always there for others. <strong>Thank you.</strong></em></li> 
            <li><strong><em>Grace:</em></strong><em> You allow a continued friendship between me and the kids’ dad, and have extended genuine friendship to me as well. (And thankfully I can at least always count on you to answer text messages! lol!) There’s nothing like toasting a glass of wine together at a graduation party or how you save seats for us next to you in church that proves to the world that love is much more powerful than hate. <strong>Thank you.</strong></em></li> 
            <li><strong><em>Faith:</em></strong><em> Your bold, wholehearted pursuit of a relationship with Jesus and the strength you draw from your ever-growing faith are both an example and an inspiration for all of us. <strong>Thank you.</strong></em></li> 
            <li><em><strong>Authenticity:</strong> You’re the real deal. You don’t claim to be perfect, nor condemn others who aren’t. There’s nothing put-on about you. You embrace who you are and laugh at the rest. <strong>Thank you.</strong></em></li> 
            <li><strong><em>Love:</em></strong><em> You make my kids’ dad happier than I’ve ever seen him. Because of you, the kids will have a legacy of seeing their dad in a healthy marriage that they’ll carry forward forever. <strong>Thank you.</strong></em></li> 
           </ol> 
          </blockquote> 
          <p><em>So thank you, Kari, for investing your heart and influence into the lives of my kids…OUR kids. Thanks for showing them that love is bigger than fear—and that love wins.</em></p> 
          <p><em>I’m honored to share Mother’s Day with you and recognize that our kids will truly be better because they had another mother like YOU to love them. </em></p> 
          <p>You rock, sister-mama! I love you!</p> 
          <p>Happy Mother’s Day!</p> 
          <p><em>Together in Jesus, with love and gratitude-</em></p> 
          <p><em>Kami</em></p>
