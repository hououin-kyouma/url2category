I have been trying as much as possible to join this academy in order to learn more about my religion,be able to read write and speak Arabic so as to understand the quran When it is read or while I\\\'m reading it so as to ponder in its meaning. But due to my financial constraints I\\\'m not able to do So. I need you to please help sponsor me learn so that I will have knowlege and help use it to teach my family and other Muslims who I have access to. I\\\'m Un-able to pay due to lack of funds as I\\\'m a civil servant whose salary cannot take care of my family and needs and at thesame time pay my tuition fees. I hope you will find it in your heart to hepl me so that Allah will help you too. Thank you very much. May Allah reward you abundantly. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> I am writing to you to express my interest to take up courses in your institute aspiring to pursue a career in Islamic knowledge.I have a rich follower ship of your programmes on HUDA TV and also been attending gatherings where lectures are delivered by various scholars coming to Qatar as its where ilive and I have soaked myself in measureless perception in the Islamic jurisprudence knowledge area over the years.I believe that pursuing some courses in your institute will enhance my earlier skills and help me add to my knowledge of the religion to gain a better understanding. I completed my Bachelor\\\'s in 2006 and since then, i have been struggling to survive in learning the religion especially learning the Qur\\\'an. Over the last 2 years, I have been working very hard to memorize some part of the Qur\\\'an as well as knowing the tafseer,and attending a summer Arabic program will help me to gain a lot in the region since most lectures are delivered in Arabic language. I have put in a great deal of efforts in all my endeavors.Sincerity and willingness to spread the religion virtues that were inculcated in my character since the beginning of my stay in Qatar, and as a result I never shied away from challenges since its one of the characteristics of the scholars.Learning on my own and sharing my knowledge with others has been most worthwhile,which I believe will work to spread the religion. I wish to pursue further education as I believe that learning should be a continuous process. </p>

I have done my private high school (GED - General Education Development which is an equevelant to the high school program accredited from USA and it is mostly acceptable in most of the universities). I intend to seek Islamic knowledge through your academy because my dream is to be an islamic scholar one day, not to gain fame but for the sake of Allah insha Allah so that i might be able to save myself because of saving others. My aim after i finish studies in your academy would be to continue my studies until when i can. I want to be a good person who can guide himself and others to the right path. My financial situation is bad and i am not able to afford the fees. Although i studied a bechelor in a universoty, i am indebted with great amount which i could not pay yet.My father as well is under debts which are huge. I hope you understand my situation insha Allah Jazakum Allahu Khairan Wassalamu alaikum </p>

While I am busy studying for my A levels I do not have the time to find a job that will support me or my family. Next to the my education I do have a time to learn my beautiful Islamic religion and I feel very happy to take this opportunity for myself because by learning Islam it will help me not only with my education but my life as whole because inshallah I wish to become a man who is able to have a stable career but to also have a strong faith in which will help me live a life in which Islam is everything. The reason why I am writing this letter is to ask for a sponsor because one day while I was busy searching for ways to study Islam, I came upon this website the Huda Academy and upon looking further into this I was able to find interesting courses which I could not believe to find over the internet, alhumadullah I am very grateful that I have found the Huda Academy as it will help me have strong faith in Islam. All I am asking from you brothers and sisters is to help me be able to access these courses so that I am able to learn more about our beautiful religion. May Allah praise you and your family. jazakallah kheyran jazaa.. abdikani Ahmed uk </p>

As a Muslim woman i am really interested in learning Qur\\\'an thus gearing towards knowing my religion.I believe every subject has its language and i have no doubt that Arabic is indeed the right language for studying Qur\\\'an.furthermore,on the drive to know my religion by learning Qur\\\'an, the foundation to begin with is the Basic Arabic Course. I am a civil servant with low income earnings and a bread winner in a polygamous family.Allah is my witness that i can\\\'t afford the fees for the course at the moment. My plan and aspiration after the course is to learn Qur\\\'an in order to be able to perform the principles of the Islamic religion correctly as directed in the the Qur\\\'an and to further extend the message to my family and community. </p>

Muslims will rule this world and this world will become a peaceful land to live, where the peoples weather in majority or in minority will have equal rights, no division will based on color, Race, Language etc. as said by the Divine Messenger of Allah in Khutba-Hija-tu-Wida.

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Assalamu Alaikum, I am currently a student at Texas Tech University doing a post-bachelors program in Petroleum Engineering. I have been an active Muslim in my hometown(Houston, Texas) under Sheikh Waleed Basyouni at Clear Lake Islamic Center. I was the youth director for 6 years until having to move to Lubbock to further my eduction. Right now because I am going to school full time I am not working and do not have a financial income. I depend on my mother(may Allah bless her) who is a single working mother(my father passed away when I was 5 years old). InshaAllah next year I will be the president of Texas Tech University Muslim Student Association. I feel like once I finish these courses I will be able to pass the knowledge along to the brothers and sisters at this University. I have watched a preview of the Prophets(saw) prayer and I know this material is perfect for students to learn about. In the college community there aren\\\'t that many resources for people to learn about Islam. After discovering Huda online academy I know that I can, with the will of Allah, help others learn more about Islam. Please consider me for the scholarship. I believe I am qualified for the scholarship because I have worked with youth for over 6 years and I continue to do so. I believe by getting this scholarship I will be able to use the Islamic knowledge I gain to provide a positive impact in my community and to any future youth I encounter inshaAllah. JazakumAllahu Khairan </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> From: Samra Tahir April 19,2013. To: Sponsor, Huda Online Academy. Dear Sir/Madam, I am a high school graduate and am memorizing Quran here in United Arab Emirates. I wanted to learn Islam and many things regarding this religion. I also wanted to learn Arabic. I am learning it from a book named “Arabic through the Quran” by “Alan Jones” as it was impossible for me to do it from some institute in the present situation. I am really very much determined to learn Islam but I have some hurdles in this regard. I am actually from Pakistan but am living in United Arab Emirates. I watched Huda Academy’s series of ’The Prophet’s Prayer’ by Dr. Muhammad Salah. It was a nice one and as I said before I want to learn many other things too. Before when I used to offer Salah every body around me used to ask me a lot of questions and most of them used to say that why do you offer Salah like men. I tried to set my aim of life and ended up in setting it to learning new things and teaching them to others. I set it up in the light of Prophet’s saying “Acquire knowledge from cradle to grave” and also many other’s ahadith regarding acquiring knowledge and then spreading them. You may follow the following link to know more about me and my intentions: samratahir.wordpress.com I hope the reader may consider my intention favorably and hope to see a good response, Inshallah! Thank You, Yours Truly, Samra Tahir. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Dear Brother/Sister in Islam Assalamualikum Warahamatullahi Wabarakatuhu I am Sri Lankan Woman of 46 years living in the Arab Emirates with my husband and two children aged 15 and 12. I am a born muslim but was not religious and followed the western life style wearing western clothes. But Alhamdulillah a few years back Allah subhanawatala guided me and showed me the straight path and I have completely changed myself from A to Z and not only I am wearing my hijab but also the Abaya. Ever since this day I am in whatever way seeking knowledge by reading the authenticated books. I have started going for tajweed classes here in Dubai to Al Huda Markas and they are kind enough to waive the charges on me becuse of my financial situation. Allah Subahawatal has blessed us in food and a roof above and I cannot grumble for not having anything more as many in the world are suffering without them. I am currently working to support my husband and children and with this income alhamdulillah it is enough to live the day and not for extra activities. Due to this, I seek a sponsorship to enable me to further my knowledge and once I have finished, to spread the word of Islam to those I know and help everyone on the stright and true path. I hope you will help me to realise my dream. Jazakallah Kahiran and I truly appreciate the time you spend in reading the above and may the almighty bless you n the rest who have comforward in helping muslims to seek knowledge. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Alsalam I am applying for this scholarship for my son,who is now turning 14 yrs.old and has never attended an Islam school due to there being no islamic schools where we live what so ever.Our children need to learn about Islam and the religion and also how to read and write.I have found online teachings but they ask for too much and I cannot afford the prices.We are a family of six on a low income.I am hoping for my children to learn the quran and sala and hadith so they can achieve the most of life and one step closer to the jannah.InshaAllah.We hope for him to learn as much as he can so that he can also pass on his knowledge to his siblings and to others who need to learn about the religion.He wants so badly to conquer as much as he can.I myself cannot teach him much because like him I was born in the U.S. and didn\\\'t learn much just the basics.Raising children in the U.S. where there is alot of mixing of cultures is very hard and we have to try as much as possible to raise our children the islamic way.Todays society is a great challenge but when there is knowledge amongst our children they can do right from wrong.With the help of generous people alot can be done to achieve our goals.We are a small community of muslims and our children are being deprived of islamic schools.I really hope you consider helping me to make an important change in our childrens lives.Our goals are Islamic teachings for reading the quran and understanding the teachings of Prophet Mohammed P.B.U.H. </p>

I pray to Allah to make the courses beneficial to the umma and reward the sponsors in this world and the hereafter.Ameen. </p>

Amma’a Ba’ad: السلام عليكم ورحمةالله و بر كا ته First, I would like to thank Allah subhannahu wa ta’ala, for giving me another chance to come across with Al-Huda noble program.However I found out that there is fees for every semester which personally I could not really afford at the moment.I am low income earner which only covered for my medical allowance and to my family remittance. alhamdulilLaah.It has been my ultimate desire and wishes to study Islamic Studies ever since. I had been attending Islamic Lectures, Symposiums and registered in an Islamic Center in my country back home learned Seerah, Fiqh, Basic Arabic however it was in a short period of time,Our Islamic Center ended up with no strong commitment due to environmental factor with our government agencies (Philippines).It is however difficult when there is no one to ask who really implement and practice the correct manhaj of Islamic Methodoly.Sad but true.Alhamdulillah, I was born with Muslim parents, though practicing Islam without understanding is an “issue”. I wish I could arm with knowledge to share with them.May Allaah grant my wish.( ameen )for I am in dire need of Allah\\\'s pleasure to learn the correct teaching. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Assalaamu Alaikum warahmatuLLAAHI wabarakaatuH! Dear Huda Online Academy, Application for Scholarship. With reference to the above subject-matter, I humbly wish to apply for a scholarship in order to study at the academy. I am a graduate of Ahmadu Bello University with a degree in Law specializing in Islamic Law to be precise. I am currently under a one-year National Youth Service programme designed for every Nigerian graduate before employment. I earn at least N19,600.00 per month and the programme will end in October this year &amp; will return to study at the Nigerian Law School at the same period INSHA ALLAH. I believe, INSHA ALLAH, if given a scholarship I stand a better chance of enlightening or giving da\\\'awah to the Muslims and Non-Muslims alike about the need for Islam and Islamiic Law especially at this current era where there are so many crisis in almost every aspect of our lives. I will INSHA ALLAH also re-create more awareness about Huda TV and Huda Academy to the people. INSHA ALLAH I will sponsor a student or more students if I become financially capable in the near future INSHA ALLAH. Thank you and may Allah help you, AAmeen! Wassalaam! </p>

I am Aisha Ummul-Jamil Ishaq, a student of Fouad Lababidi Islamic Academy, Wuse Zone 3 Abuja, Nigeria. I am in SS2A (science and mathematics department). I live at block D3 flat 7 finance quarters ,Wuye.I am seventeen years old. My hobbies are: reciting the holy Qur\\\'an,cooking, singing Islamic nasheeds, writing Arabic calligraphy, and helping the less privileged.My future ambition is to become a Medical Doctor (Insha Allah). I believe, that I am qualified to apply for sponsorship based on my previous performances and in anticipation of passing my final year examination with good grades in sciences and mathematics (Insha Allah). Please note that, currently I depend on my parents for sponsorship who are civil servants. My intention, is to use the knowledge to assist the less privilege in the society by offering free consultations, and assistance to improve their health standards. I come from a less privileged community, from Taraba State, where women, particularly require the services of a doctor who can assist them in delivery, to reduce the maternal and child mortality whose prevalence remain high and therefore need to be reduced in line with standard and best practice.As a Muslimah, I feel I will be fulfilled to see my self as an instrument to reducing the hardship encountered arising from bad governance or inability of those in authority to provide the basic need expected of them as leaders. Please accept my reasons. ma\\\'ssalam! </p>

I am really keen to learn authentic Islamic knowledge so I try to get it from where ever I can get, but of course free of cost, I consider Sheikh Salah as my teacher as I have learnt a lot from his programmes. I am trying to understand The Quran, learning Tafseer at the same time I have a group of ladied and young kids specially teen aged girls to whom I am trying to teach our beautiful Deen. so it makes it more important that I learn and get more authentic knowledge.

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Learning the language of the Qura\\\'an and reciting it properly is a dream for most of us who are non native Arab speakers. Coming from a non practising family, I had very little knowledge of Islam and what it preaches and ordains. With the grace of Allah, I have been blessed some time back with good friends and guidance. Since then I have gone through books, lectures and kutbas, trying to learn Islam from the finer details to the more prominent issues and I have tried with the permission of Allah to implement as much as I could understand. However, I regretfully do not know Arabic and without proper understanding of Arabic, there is a lacking in acquiring the knowledge of deen. Furthermore, I read the Qura\\\'an with a lot of stuttering and I have no knowledge of any tajweed rules. It is for me, a dream to read the Qura\\\'an fluently, to understand and feel the words of the Almighty. I currently have 2 months of holiday and with Ramadan around the corner, it would be an incredible opportunity to turn those 8 weeks and this holy month into a fruitful journey of acquiring a lifetime\\\'s knowledge by following simultaneously the Basic Arabic course and the tawjeed course. I am a dedicated and hard working student but my part time job is only enough to cover my day to day expenses currently. However dreams have no price and if I manage to cover these 2 courses,they will be a stepping stone for advanced Arabic courses and Insha Allah teaching kids in my town too. </p>

I think i am qualified for this scholarship based on one sole reason; my plan not to fail. i have seen myself as someone derailing from this great religion ISLAM, i was trained since i was small to read and write Arabic but i never understand the meaning of what i write at all, if what i wrote was wrong or right. though ma\\\'sha Allah, i can read the glorious Qur\\\'an and can see the meanings but i can really tell how the meaning was constructed, what meaning of each word carries, how to construct my own sentences and how to deliver my own speech in Arabic as well. but when i watched hudatv and i saw this opportunity, in couldn\\\'t resist, i had to rush down the web and see how i can take my chances in learning Arabic and been constructive too. i have a strong point to make known here, i am not learning this to seek international job or whatever but to boost my self morally, creatively and academically. I will be very glad if my application is given great consideration. JAZAKA LLAHUL KHAER. LUQMAN MAHMOOD </p>

As for my case the reason why I want to be qualified for the scholarship is without a doubt I want to learn my deen from the right people who have the right source. Financially I can\\\'t pay for the courses due to being part of a big family(alhamduillah) and I am also a student at my local university and that\\\'s why it\\\'s a bit hard for me to pay. I\\\'m a teenager who lives in Melbourne, Australia and subhanallah it is very hard to leave as a youth in this country due to a lot of things which I\\\'m sure you guys know about. Also Inshallah I have made intention to apply for The Islamic University of Medinah and I tend to dedicate my youth learning my deen properly and inshallah I also have a dream that one day to join you guys in spreading the deen but ofcourse all that can\\\'t be done in over a night so a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step and inshallah my single step will be from here if Allah wills. Everything is under the control of Allah and I ask Allah to make everything easy for me and for you guys and the whole muslims around the globe. Jazakallah Khair. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> assalamualaikum Sponsors, My name is Rakeeza. I am from singapore. I am a born muslim. However, I never practised my religion. There are various excuses and reasons that I can provide for that statement. But I think one of which I really think is because of my father. My father is a wonderful dad. Alhamdulilah. I am so blessed to have such wonderful parents who loves me and cares for me. However, my father isn\\\'t religious, so when I was brought up by him, I thought having tattoos and drinking alcohol was not haraam. (thank allah, I did not experiment in those things yet). few months ago, I wouldn\\\'t even have considered myself as a muslim. I was ashamed, I have made many sins. But one day, I met a dear friend. He helped me and told me that Allah is the most forgiving. He taught me how to pray, how to recite the iqra(basics). I started changing, praying five times a day, and learning more about my religion. I want to learn more. So when I heard about Huda online academy, I wanted to enrol. I love the free courses, But I want to join some of the paid ones as well. Unfortunately, my household income does not support that. I have 3 siblings i need to take care of and my parents are too old to work. I want to educate my siblings as well through islam. And one day, once I have finished my course, I want to share my knowledge. I want to be a ustazah some day and I want to sponsor others in this site in shaa allah. So help me...dua for me sisters and brothers, and i will do the same eeza </p>

I want to understand the Quran by learning Arabic Language, I don’t know how to speak and write Arabic, I would like to learn the Arabic Courses so that I can understand the Quran. If Huda Academy will help me in Teaching/learning Arabic Language it will help me very much in my Life &amp; Aqirat. After learning from Huda Academy today, InshaAllah tomorrow when I will be stronger enough on my feet, I will help a person who is in need. InshAllah i will help our Muslim community &amp; please pass my message to all Muslim brothers &amp; sisters to offer Namaz &amp; Quran. Pray for all Muslim brothers &amp; sisters of SYRIA .

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Since the early times of my teenage, I have been dreaming to contribute something new to my country, my continent and the world too. I remember that ever since I was in high school, I paid rapt attention to the socio-economic changes and government policy makings, difference in the development level of countries across the world and reasons behind. After completing my high school classes successfully and joined university, I started looking for department which is the best way to reach my dream of being an economist and having the capacity to deal in such a global economy filled with uncertainty. When I got scholarship chance to do Masters Degree in 2011 at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (Seoul, South Korea), I was really glad of Joining Comparative Development stream. Then I was employed in Debre Berhan University as Lecturer in the Department of Economics. My main responsibility in the institution is to teach economics courses for undergraduate students, prepare course materials and modules and to undertake research studies intended to solve the deep-rooted and chronic poverty in the country. When I was lecturing at the university, I taught more than 15 different courses, 6 research work and provide 2 community service; which helped me to relate the theoretical framework with the real problem of the world. But I realized that I spent much of my earlier life studying academic without giving emphasis to religious knowledge. Thus, I decided to study more about principle of Islamic theology by visiting local Imams and Ulemas. While I was learning from local Imams and Ulemas, I came across with a wide range of ideas dealing with different aspect of Islamic concepts. Once again, I have realized that the knowledge I have needs to be developed by advanced and practical education which make search for scholarship program in Huda Academy. I am greatly inspired to study at Huda Acadamy about Islam but I don’t have sufficient money to cover the cost of the program given my monthly salary is below 400 dollar. Thank You very much for considering my application and for your time! </p>

Several types of knowledge are wide spread across the earth which are not in conformity of the through teachings of AL- Islam. I have interest in identifying my Lord and how best i can worship him since my childhood but the community is only interested in the acquiring the Circular knowledge leaving that of Islam; i graduated from a University in Nigeria hoping to secure a job to aid and assist some of the Daawah project i have been working on since my undergraduate days. but as Allah will have it am yet to secure any. when i came across Huda on the satellite at a visit to one of my Uncle caught my attension the great scholars they have. My Passion and strengthen will be of great addition if In sha Allah i study under the shuyukh in al Huda. My limiting factor in paying for the course is my Unemployment and my parents that managed to send to a University are now retired. My offering this course is what i hope for in Allahs Mercy </p>

I am a 17 year old student who is really keen in seeking knowledge through Huda Academy. My educational goal with Huda Academy would be learning basic Arabic, aqeedah, fiqh, hadith, tasfir, and tajweed. Hopefully, by receiving a scholarship, I can learn this beautiful deen and pass it on by the help of Allah SWT. The reason I need this scholarship is because my mother is single mother of 6 children with alot of financial difficulties. I don\\\'t want to overburden her because at the moment she is going through a lot. Overall receiving this scholarship would be amazing for both me and my mother. One thing that really inspired me to seek this knowledge is a beautiful hadeeth that I read that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: “One who treads a path in search of knowledge has his path to Paradise made easy by God…” - Riyadh us-Saleheen, 245 May Allah make the path to Jannah easy for me, my family and the Ummah. AMEEN! </p>

I am currently unemployed right now because I am looking for a job which fits the agenda of Islam and the Sacred Ummah. Allah only created us for Islam and through it gave us honor. The deen of Islam is worth fighting for to make it superior and at the same time having the highest of traits and qualities in portraying and presenting, Islam. Moreover, I believe in the rewards of Allah, in the next life. Since we work hard in this world, Allah has set up a final Day to collect all of our wages and rewards. Allah promises an end reward/provision which will never diminish nor finish because Allah is The Everliving/Everlasting Refuge/Immortal/Bestower. Working with the directives of Islam is the best way to ensure/secure these promised rewards of Allah, enshallah. After I finish these courses, I plan to offer educational services at the local masjid and become a Khateeb, enshallah. Jazakallah Khairan, Barakallah Feek, May Allah keep you well in this life and the next ameen. Raheel Hameed </p>

Scholarship committee: The value of Arabic education is something that i have understood since a very young age.Neither of my parents had an opportunity to attend advance Arabic school,and faced many struggles in their personal and professional lives because of this.They made commitment early in my life to do everything within their power to instill in me a love of learning and an understanding of the importance of hard work and dedication.Because of their love and sacrifice over the years,I have been able to devote the time and energy necessary to academic accomplishment even though money has always been tight. My family has made many sacrifices to allow me to focus on Arabic education through out my basic Arabic school.I now have an opportunity to become the first person in my family to attend Arabic college,though I\\\'m in need of financial assistance to realize what has been a long term goal for me and a dream for my parents. If selected for this scholarship,I will continue to apply the same diligence to my collegiate studies as i have to this point,making education and service to others my top priority.I will represent your organization well during my years in college and beyond.Thank you in advance for your consideration. Yours Sincerely Salaudeen Mutiat Oluwaseun </p>

It would also be a great honor for me to have the opportunity and learn everything there is to know anout islam, o truly know that its the true religion i would like to guide first of all my family which after sharing my faith with them and knowing what little they understand and know about their own faith makes me eager to get fully educated in islam. I have aspirations in expanding dawah to latin america specially in North of Mexico, i see so much potential in this area and it would make me absolutely happy that after having the opportunity to study at huda academy i would have the knowledge and wisely be able to spread islam within these areas of Mexico, i would like to thank you for your academy </p>

Previously i was a teacher in a school,as soon as I came to knw abt this Alhuda Quran course, I resignd my job n joined here. My dream was always to learn Quran with understanding. My husband is an engineer n had his own business but it underwent huge loss. Since then he is unable to pick up nor cud get into good job.Now he is earning just12000 Indian rupees per month which is not sufficient to run d house n also pay my two kids fees,because of this im unable to send my kids to any of d islamic courses, Alhamdulillah my parents support me by giving some amount every mnth.I know Allah is testing me, He is testing whether I will join back frustrated leaving this learning of Quran .But Alhamdulillah I\\\'m content by d special mercy of Allah . I know it\\\'s not wrong to work as teacher to support the family but here in India we cannot wear our hijab to teach which is against the ayahs of Surah Noor and Ahzaab, except in very few islamic schools which are located very very far from our residence so I cannot go. Now after joining this Quran course my focus has become mainly Akhirah, I don\\\'t want to lose it for d sake of some money. I have complete tawakkul in Allah that He will surely provide to my husband itself InshaAllah without me going to the job. once things are alright I pay u back the whole fees InshaAllah. Plz make dua for the same. I want to be a full time daee after learning all these courses InshaAllah. </p>

I am from a family of 6 siblings raised by a single parent my father Mr Morki Hussein who is a teacher at a primary school. My mother passed away in 2009, and since then my father has been raising us up, I am person who is very dedicated to Islam and hoping one day to participate in the spreading of DA\\\'WAH globally. I would be very appreciative to obtain this sponsorship IN SHA ALLAH Hoping this letter meets your favourable consideration ASALAM ALAIKUM </p>

My family are hindu and disowned me and chucked me out when i became Muslim when i was 18years old due to the fact they don\\\'t like me wearing Khimar and Jilbab. Alhamdulillah aala kuli aal. It hasn\\\'t been easy however i am happy Allah guided me Alhamdulillah. My education was disrupted and due to the consequences of becoming a Muslim in a hindu falmily, things have been very difficult. Alhamdulillah I am now at a point i can concentrate on learning more about Islam. Due to the emotional tests of losing all my family i wasn\\\'t able to be as active in learning as i wished to be. I have recently set up a non profit organisation. The non profit organisation is call Project E.V.E, elevating via eeman. A group of us try and be a support network for fellow women. I am currently not working due to sufferring from panic attacks and thus my financial situation doesn\\\'t facilitate me to pay. With Project E.V.E i would like to offer the sisters more, i would like to learn to implement and become a better muslim firstly and foremost, and there after also to share what I learn with my fellow sisters and fulfil dawah In sha Allah. I make Du\\\'a Allah gives me the tawfiq to learn this perfect deen, to implement what i learn and to please Him. Your Sister Raheemah. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> I converted to Islam when I was 13 almost 14 years old. I live in a city where there are no Muslims around me. I have to keep myself in check and find resources to learn about Islam on my own. I think I am qualified for this scholarship because I am a Muslim with very few resources to get new information. I have two parents who work very hard and cover some of my finances in other things having to do with school. I think this will help them a lot by getting my Islamic courses paid for. I currently do not have a job and do not plan to get one until after high school. Once I finish my courses, I intend on becoming a better Muslim. I also want to show people the real Islam and use my knowledge from these courses and other resources to show them it in sha Allah. I also want to change people\\\'s lives with my knowledge I receive from these courses. Maybe if I speak to someone about Islam and share this knowledge with them that they can love Islam and possibly convert. In sha Allah my knowledge from these courses will help other people. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Respected Sir, My name is master NAFIS Nuruddin ANSARI. I belong from a city called Ratnagiri in India at its western coast. From childhood onwards I have an hobby to learn many things related to Islam. So along with my daily school studies I used to keep on knowing some or the other things about Islam. But Alhamdulillah now as I got an opportunity to do an deep Islamic study through Huda Academy I do not want to loose it at all. Now my small hobby is changed to an great ambition. Now as the topic of ambition arises actually I have an ambition for further engineering studies,etc. But I also have many plans for mine this Islamic ambition. My parents are a bit mod I hope you understand. May Allah give them good hidayah. But I don\\\'t think they will sponsor me for mine this part time Islamic study. So I was in a need of a scholarship sponsor. So that I can manage my Islamic course with scholarship money and continue my duniya studies with my parent\\\'s money. I hope someone will definitely help me and become a goodoer for Islam. :) Wassalam!!! Yours Faithfully, Nafis Nuruddin Ansari </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Asalamalaikum, Brothers/Sisters While growing up rather than Islam being the root of my values, my family due to lack of islamic knowledge themselves raised us emphasizing cultural norms. Al though, I was taught moral etiquettes, islamic teaching was not implemented within my household. I failed to identify with other muslims and lacked proper knowledge with regards to Prayer, Quran and Hadith. I had completed quran at a fairly young age yet, did not know its meaning nor did I know its core teachings. As I grew older, life compelled me to gravitate towards finding Allah, I began to pray and read the translation of Quran in english. I have a strong desire to learn about our beautiful deen, as I can not only educate my family and friends whom surround me, but most significantly so that I may teach my children. Now at this point in my life Allah has given me the hidayat to want to learn; however, at the moment financially I can not afford to pay for classes as my husband is not stable. He is currently under severe financial distress and to ask him for money for classes I believe is not right at the moment. It is my request to any brother or sister reading this to sponsor my education so that I may be able to feed my soul with what it craves and that is to be closer to Allah (swt) and to spread the knowledge I learn to help make our communities stronger and to teach our children and families the beauty of our religion so that we could be guided towards the right path. JazakAllah </p>

I currently work for a dispatch company called MNZ transport I am paid a monthly salary of 1400 a month. As you can imagine this is not much for a person to have extra money to pay for school. I would like the opportunity to get a Islamic education so that I can broaden what I have to offer to my local Masjid. I currently do the jannazahs for my Masjid but I feel as though there is so much more I can offer. Anything I learn I will try my best to give back to my community as well as the up and coming youth. I believe that knowledge should be shared and spread like a germ. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (3461) it is narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:Convey from me, even if it is a verse. InshaAllah this will be my opportunity to share one verse or one alphabet.Not only will this benefit my community and my children but this will help me and my deen. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Dear Sir, This is to express my need for scholarship at HUDA Academy. I\\\'m a post graduate in Medical Biotechnology, but my purpose in this life means much more than my career. I want to make this world easily accessible to the authentic Islamic for True Peace. Most of the people residing in various parts of the world believe in whatever knowledge they are taught by the scholars of their community. Some are smart enough to hunt for the truth until they find the right place though. Unfortunately, only a minority have the courage to realize, ignore and correct the fabricated teachings of Islam by seeking the true knowledge with persistence.I hope my hunt for true Islamic knowledge will end up here and I believe HUDA academy will fulfill my thirst for the authentic Islam. I have been waiting for seven years to find the right place. I have not joined any vague classes thinking that may confuse me. Kindly fulfill my desire by granting me the scholarship. I wanted all the Islamic mosques worldwide to follow the shariah that is being implemented by Masjid al Haram. There is no place better than this, so why people cant follow the rules here rather than following the modern innovative Islam taught by various scholars whose knowledge cant prove the Islamic authenticity. I want all the mosques worldwide keep a copy of the book \\ </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Salamo \\\'aleykum dear brothers/sisters, My name is Qasem Losada, I\\\'m 35 years-old and currently live in Madrid, Spain. I finished my last studies at the university in 2005, when I graduated with honours in Philosophy, speciality in Logic. But I didn\\\'t stop there and continued intermitently, depending on my laboral situation, following courses on a diversity of topics such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Linguistics, English Language and Literature or Seminaries of Philosophy. Lately, since a devastating economic crisis installed on my country in 2008 and continued with little of no recovery up to this very day, I have found difficulties to find a full-time job which forced me to renounce all luxuries and return to the paternal home where I still live nowadays. In 2008 I was diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder which persisted until mid-2012. The costs of the treatment have damaged even more the family resources and limited my aspirations of a full-time occupation those long and anguishing years. As enigmatically as it set in, it also faded away quickly after the indicated period of four years. Now there is no trace of illness remaining al Hamdulillah. I plan to study our beautiful deen systematically to better participate in the affairs of the spanish muslim community and also for da\\\'wah purposes. I want to fight the rising Islamophobia in my country with solid knowledge. Thanks in advance and may Allah keep you in the best of states. Best regards wa salam, Qasem </p>

I feel I am a phenomenal candidate for the scholarship because I desire to make a positive difference in the world around me. Continuing my education in pursuit of a course in tajweed will allow me to do just that. I desire to pursue tajweed because I want to help people in my community by providing them with the necessary knowledge on how to read the quran and assistance to positively impact their lives. As this scholarship would positively impact my life and help me pursue my goals and dreams, I want to give back by doing the same for the people I serve within the community i use my house to teach young girls the holy quran since am also trying better than most of the parents of those kids. i feel i need to improve my present skill in reading for proper passing of the message. i would not as for this scholarship if my present earning tally with my commitments. i have a resources deficit and need help to help other a better way. Continuing on my journey of excellence by obtaining knowledge tajweed in will allow me to help other youth and to truly make life better for the people around me. My desire to learn and grow will allow me to put your scholarship funds to good use. Not only do I plan on attending the classes necessary during sessions to get knowledge, I also plan to continue my effort in spreading islam. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> السلام عليكم Mississippi is maybe one of, if not the number one state in the US that is misinformed about Islam. I have been Muslim for about 6 years and I have a concern for these people; my parents, grandparents, sister and brothers, aunts and uncles, friends and cousins. I want to further my ilm so I can increase in my dawah and by Allah permission establish the dawah here in this place of shirk and kufr. For a living I do dhabihah in a poultry plant, but lately it has been one day a week. Having a wife and three kids is hard living in the US and working one day a week. Alhumdulillah I have been blessed to have a nice library of books but my main focus is to become fluent in Arabic. I was raised as a Christians and in my younger days I was trying to become a rap musician. After finishing high school I moved to Atlanta trying to become a star. I so happen to pick up a book about world religions. I had been left Christianity, it just wasn\\\'t what I was seeking. I still believed in God but not the religion of the cross. I began to make up my own religion, but one day I began to read about Islam, the concept of one God captured me. And I am the perfect example of how hidiyah is from Allah.So I pray that for the sake of Allah you all will help me in this journey of seeking knowledge. May Allah reward you and grant you the highest level of Jinnah. Peace be upon Muhummad, his family, his companions and all those who follow him on that righteous path. </p>

Once I finish my courses,It is my intention to preach the same to students in Mauritius,by any means,at madrassah,by donations.I have in fact applied and requested for a Huda TV branch to be set up in Mauritius,with me being an ambassador and dedicate my time and donate towards institutions and people in need.Inshallah Huda TV admin will respond to my request and I hope to receive the scholarship as well. May Allah reward you. Jazak Allah Khair Nabeelah </p>

I have got MBA in Finance from Bangladesh University of Business &amp; Technology (BUBT; Bachelor of Law (LL.B) from National University of Bangladesh. I have received some Banking related trainings and several diplomas &amp; certifications with banking, accounting &amp; computing was successfully completed. I want to be a performing Muslim but my Islamic knowledge is not appropriate for that. So I would like to learn further knowledge about fundamental of Islam and Islamic Shariah, Islamic Finance, Islamic Muamalah etc. Bangladesh is known as a Muslim Country but we have not sufficient actual knowledge about Islam. There are some misconception are present here and there which is widely manipulate about Muslim Society to other religion. Only one things that is education not only education but also real education &amp; learning about Islam which will remove that from society. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> I am a Muslim and was taught to read the Quran at an early age in a local Quranic School. Arabic is not widely spoken and even my Quranic teacher cannot speak Arabic. The absence of Arabic knowledge has a serious impact on the pronouncement of words in the Quran and the quality of reading the Quran. Fundamentally, you miss the proper reading of the Holy Quran because for example, you will miss the places you can pause and even the stopping points. Most importantly though, you will not understand the meaning of the Quran. This is the situation I find myself in. I want to be able to properly read the Quran and understand its meaning. I do not want to turn to the English translation to understand what I am reading since some emphasis is lost when you translate from one language to another. Knowing Arabic will help me avoid loosing some context from the original Arabic that is lost when translated to another language. Secondly, knowing Arabic will help me read and understand the accompanying commentary provided in the Quran Tafsir. And thirdly, Arabic knowledge will help me read and understand the hadiths of the prophet. Fourthly, Arabic language knowledge will also give me access to other important non-translated Arabic knowledge resources. I come from a very poor background with limited financial resources with a family to support from my meager salary. I will very much appreciate a scholarship to enable me acquire Arabic knowledge to help me understand the Quran and hadith. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Salaam Alaikum, Insha'Allah you are in the best of health and iman. I would like to attend Huda Academy and continue my Arabic studies. I would like to some day go to Al - Azar University. I am 13 years old and am a freshman in High School. I just began home schooling online with my mother who is a single mother and does her best to give me the best education. She has been a convert to Islam since I was a baby and I know nothing but this beautiful deen Alhamdulillah. I would like to supplement my online education with Islamic studies and someday lead my family the way she has lead me. Huda Academy has many great teachers and I believe it to be the best place for me to learn. This last year mama got sick and can not afford much anymore as far as extras for me. She is now on disability but still provides me with as much as she can. Please allow me this opportunity to develop my deen the best way I can with the best teachers Insha'Allah. May Allah continue to guide you all and lead you on the straight path Insha'Allah. Elyzen Hernandez USA </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim Assalam alaikum warahmatullahi wa barakatuh, my name is malang fatty, i am a muslim.i want to study Arabic language at Huda Academy but i cant pay for myself, therefore am looking for a sponsor. the reason(s) i want to study Arabic is; i always feel touched when i open up a good translation of the meaning of the Qur’an and i ponder and wonder at the beauty of the words and the deep meanings within. But in reality i am just seeing a glimpse of the real treasure that the Qur’an is. Imagine how i would feel if i could understand the words of Allah in the form in which they were sent down and not just rely on a translation of the meaning in English. Imagine the power of the words and the directness of the message then! The potency would be awesome! The Qur’an is the word of Allah; a direct message from Allah to us His creation and Allah chose the Arabic language as the language of this message. Indeed Allah tells us this in the Qur’an emphasising to us that to understand the message in its fuller form one must understand the language: “Indeed we have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an, in order that you may understand” (Surah Yusuf, Aayah 2) Qur’an’s direct translation is not possible, because so much of the potency and splendour of the words and their meanings which are inextricably linked to the Arabic language are lost in English or any other language. Indeed to even appreciate the poetic beauty of the Qur’an one needs to understand Arabic. </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Dear sponsors, I am Sles Ulvy, I am a muslim in Cambodia. I am very happy that I found this website that can make me to learn Arabic language. I think that all muslim around the world must be learn Arabic language because Arabic language is the language of the qur'an if we don't learn Arabic language we don't know clearly about the meaning of qur'an and if we know Arabic language we can easy to know the meaning of the qur'an. And why I want to learn Arabic and other course of Islam study? Because I want to know clearly about the Islam and I want to know about the meaning in the qur'an that qur'an is very very beautiful book, because it is from Allah (Subha nahu wataala ). And nowday when I read the qua'an I don't know the meaning of the qur'an so I really really want to know about the meaning off the qur'an so much. And why I want to get scholarship? Because I am a poor people that that live in Cambodia. and Cambodia has muslim at least 4-5% in Cambodai. And if I can study and know clearly about the Islam and know the meaning about the qur'an I can explain about the Islam to non-muslim to understand about the Islam. Best Regards, Sles Ulvy </p>

My name is Abdullahi Muhammad,I'am a Nigerian and Live in Jigawa state in a small village called Jahun.Among my family i am the only male child given to my parents by Allaah. So been alone without a brother is a trial to me from Allaah which in result of That i find it very difficult to stay away from my parents as there is no one to assist them. And besides That i love seeking knowledge of my religion but since my parents are poor i cant find any means of seeking knowledge, as seeking of knowledge needs provision and assistance.In the village i live i have friends Alhamdulillahi but most of them not ALL are not serious about studying islam.But i as a friend if i will find a place to study my deen perfectly i believe i can change their mode of leaving inshaa Allaah. They are my friends and will enjoy listening to me but they cant go to school..I love preaching, because i believe preaching is the way of our beloved prophet Muhammad. May peace of Allaah be upon him.But i cant preach without knowledge.And to the best of my ability i promise to be an obedient and thank full student if offerered this opportunity as i dont have means of sponsoring my self.I believe if given this offer my parents will be happy if i inform them about the offer and Allaah will reward me for making them happy. But staying away from them May cause me purnishment from Allaah. I will preach if i gain a very sound knowledge.Jazaakumullaahu khair.Thanks </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:20px; line-height:24px"> Asalaam Allaikum My Islam name is Yasmin, I reverted to Islam in the UK and also at Al Azar. I live in Nuweiba, South Sinai it's my Egypt husband. I have been proactive with my Islamic studies and brought many English books with me and from Al Azar too. I attended group study in the UK but there is nothing like this here, In fact I am only allowed to attend the mosque for prayers on Friday. I watch Huda TV and gain great insight and knowledge alhamdullah. My family situation and income is enough to feed us and keep us alhamdullah, I don't have anything spare money that I don't give to Zakat. (Usually time and meals) Please consider my application for a scholarship and inshAllah ya Rob I am accepted. Can you advise, I have a very old iPad and free wifi 2am to 2pm. Can I access the learning and lessons in this manor? I tried to commence the free lessons but the iPad doesn't have the Adobe platform! If SupanAllahWatAllah intend this path for me then I will do my upmost to please him. Thank you for your consideration and time. Salaam Yasmin </p>
