This led me to awaken to a new path of knowledge and understanding of the self and our own Divine nature. I found that true healing came not just from healing the body but the mind/body/Spirit as a whole. Our modern lifestyle and the lost connection with Mother Earth, The Universe and its laws, has lead us to much suffering, conflict and illness, but reconnecting with our true essence, our Soul is the key to have a balanced, loving, joyful, healthy life. I am committed to assist people who want to reclaim the balance in their life, to heal themselves on all levels. In Soul Realignmentâ¢, I have found a way to heal from the Soul and bring clarity and harmony to people about their own Divinity, it is a wonderful tool for spiritual evolution.

A knee injury in my twenties pushed me to discover alternative healing and the mind/body connection. I was then drawn to spiritual disciplines and spent ten years studying and participating in intensive Zen retreats. My understanding of the connection between mind, body and spirit has gone deeper as I have worked on my own self development over the years. Having four children has also been a force for personal growth. I feel we learn so much about ourselves from them, as they reflect so much back to us.</p> 
        <p>As time has moved on I have been drawn more toward exploring who we are at Soul level, and the journey our Souls undertake here in the physical. Soul Realignmentâ¢ is a fascinating way to explore this. It is a privilege to be able to do this work, assisting people to heal and live more consciously aware lives.</p> 
        <p>I live in the UK, where I practice Soul Realignmentâ¢, Reiki and ThetaHealingâ¢. My website for readings is <a title="Soul Secrets" href="http://www.soul-secrets.com" target="_blank">www.soul-secrets.com</a>.</p>

She has also completed Andrrea Hessâs SR Manifesting Blueprint. <strong>Annie</strong> has done her âtours of dutyâ as a SAG/AEA film/stage/actor, composer, writer, middle and high school English/Drama teacher, piano teacher, coach, all the while playing mother to five and âNanaâ to nine, and (shhhâ¦ wife to a few.)<br> Eventually&nbsp;Annie re-ignited her intuitive side, her long-standing relationship with The Creator / Universe and began inhaling every source available on spirituality, reality vs. illusion, quantum physics, the law of attraction, the spirit world, angels, and the soul on its many levels. Once she found her âcenter,â she sensed a strong pull toward sharing the lessons sheâd learned on her own journeys with others, hoping to help them make better choices than sheâd made. One day she was in the mall with her granddaughter when the little girl fell, and it looked as if she might have broken her wrist. Annie grabbed it and began to hold it to comfort her; as she did her own palm became so hot she was alarmed, and so hot the child finally asked her to âput it away.â She was blown away by what happened and decided to try Reiki. Since that time her burning passion has been to help heal others â children and adults alike â to facilitate an understanding of the truth of reality/illusion, and to empower others to live their best lives possible. Annie is convinced the most extraordinary path to that âbest life possibleâ is through the modality of Andrreaâs Soul-Realignment and the act of aligning with our own soulâs purpose and path, and clearing any blocks along that path.</p>

My particular interest has always been in the area of apparent self-sabotage; those clients who will get so far and no further, who improve and then go backwards again, or who just donât appear to be able to move forward at all, whatever the therapy being applied.

Not knowing even what psychic meant I was one at a very young age. Taking the Soul Realignment<strong>â¢</strong> Course has given me an insight into the soul and a way to help people find their Divine Self. I now have the tools to help people connect the Physical Self with the Divine Self by removing negativity caused by past choices. In doing this they are able to create the life they are meant to live. We are divine spirits choosing to experience this wonderous and challenging existence as human beings.

I found in Soul RealignmentTM, the modality I use to access your Akashic Record, a beautiful tool that connects us with the universal knowledge. I am very interested in expanding my consciousness and making the best of my journey on earth. So I try to ground all this in to my daily life, because when we start understanding about the human soul our perspective about life changes. I recognize the divine being in everyone and this awareness brings a different tone to my life.</p> 
        <p>When we&nbsp;understand that we are all different at soul level, we give people permission to be who they are; we accept the difference from another level of awareness.</p>

Itâs been part of my lifeâs journey to be curious and to seek answers to life â to understand the soul. Along my path I have studied traditional medicine as a nurse and mental health and many non-traditional healing arts such as Pleiadian light work (techniques for working with neurological and physiological blocks in our bodies â hands on energy healing.</p> 
        <p>I love to help people uncover the pieces in their life that they are avoiding, stuck in, or reflecting or deflecting on to others. My goal is to connect people with the parts of themselves that embody the vast internal resources that are available to them in life. The sessions I offer release the patterns that are causing suffering in any way, and assist you in being your true self no matter what is occurring.<br> <a href="http://www.insightfulsoul.ca">www.insightfulsoul.ca</a> or <a href="mailto:yvonne@insightfulsoul.ca">yvonne@insightfulsoul.ca</a></p>
