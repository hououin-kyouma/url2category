          The most famous rock song of all time, "Stairway To Heaven" wasn't a chart hit because it was never released as a single to the general public. Radio stations received promotional singles which quickly became collector's items.
          <br>
          <br>On Tuesday November 13, 2007, Led Zeppelin's entire back catalogue was made available as legal digital downloads, making all of their tracks eligible for the UK singles chart. As a result, at the end of that week the original version of "Stairway To Heaven" arrived in the UK singles charts for the first time. Previously, three covers had charted: the multinational studio band Far Corporation reached #8 with their version in 1985, then reggae tribute act Dread Zeppelin crawled to #62 in 1991 and finally Rolf Harris' reworking outdid the other two, peaking at #7 in 1993.
         </div></li>
        <li>
         <div class="inner">
          Robert Plant spent much of the '70s answering questions about the lyrics he wrote for "Stairway." When asked why the song was so popular, he said it could be its "abstraction," adding, "Depending on what day it is, I still interpret the song a different way - and I wrote the lyrics."
          <br>
          <br>The lyrics take some pretty wild turns, but the beginning of the song is about a woman who accumulates money, only to find out the hard way her life had no meaning and will not get her into heaven. This is the only part Plant would really explain, as he said it was "a woman getting everything she wanted without giving anything back."
         </div></li>
        <li>
         <div class="inner">
          Led Zeppelin started planning "Stairway" in early 1970, when they decided to create a new, epic song to replace "
          <a href="http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=300">Dazed And Confused</a>" as the centerpiece of their concerts. Jimmy Page would work on the song in an 8-track studio he had installed in his boathouse, trying out different sections on guitar. By April, he was telling journalists that their new song might be 15-minutes long, and described it as something that would "build towards a climax" with John Bonham's drums not coming in for some time. In October 1970, after about 18 months of near constant touring, the song took shape. Page and Plant explained that they started working on it at a 250-year-old Welsh cottage called Bron-yr-Aur, where they wrote the songs for 
          <b>Led Zeppelin III</b>. Page sometimes told a story of the pair sitting by a fire at the cabin as they composed it, a tale that gives the song a mystical origin story, as there could have been spirits at play within those walls.
          <br>
          <br>Page told a different story under oath: When he was called to the stand in 2016 as part of a plagiarism trial over this song, he said that he wrote the music on his own and first played it for his bandmates at Headley Grange in Liphook Road, Headley, Hampshire, where they recorded it using a mobile studio owned by The Rolling Stones. Plant corroborated the story in his testimony.
          <br>
          <br>Headley Grange may not be as enchanting as Bron-yr-Aur, but the place had some character: It was a huge, old, dusty mansion with no electricity but great acoustics. Bands would go there to get some privacy and focus on songwriting, as the biggest distractions were the sheep and other wildlife.
         </div></li>
        <li>
         <div class="inner">
          Robert Plant recalled writing the lyrics in a flash of inspiration. Said Plant: "I was holding a pencil and paper, and for some reason I was in a very bad mood. Then all of a sudden my hand was writing out the words, 'There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold/And she's buying a stairway to heaven.' I just sat there and looked at the words and then I almost leapt out of my seat."

          <br>Plant's implication that something else was moving his pencil for him led to speculation that it was Satan who was dictating the words, and along with the backward messages and Page's Aleister Crowley connection, there was enough evidence for many listeners that the devil had some role in creating this song.

         <div class="inner">
          This is rumored to contain backward satanic messages, as if Led Zeppelin sold their souls to the devil in exchange for "Stairway To Heaven." Supporting this theory is the fact that Jimmy Page bought Aleister Crowley's house in Scotland, known as Boleskine House. In his books, Crowley advocated that his followers learn to read and speak backwards.
          <br>
          <br>Robert Plant addressed the issue in an interview with 
          <i>Musician</i> magazine: "'Stairway To Heaven' was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that's not my idea of making music. It's really sad. The first time I heard it was early in the morning when I was living at home, and I heard it on a news program. I was absolutely drained all day. I walked around, and I couldn't actually believe, I couldn't take people seriously who could come up with sketches like that. There are a lot of people who are making money there, and if that's the way they need to do it, then do it without my lyrics. I cherish them far too much."

          This runs 8:03, but still became one of the most-played songs on American radio, proving that people wouldn't tune out just because a song was long. It was a perfect fit for FM radio, which was a newer format challenging the established AM with better sound quality and more variety. "Stairway" fit nicely into what was called the "Album Oriented Rock" (AOR) format, and later became a staple of Classic Rock. By most measures, it is the most-played song in the history of American FM radio. It has also sold more sheet music than any other rock song - about 10,000 to 15,000 copies a year, and more than one million total.

          Jimmy Page has a strong affinity for this song, and felt Robert Plant's lyrics were his best yet. He had him write all of Zeppelin's lyrics from then on.
          <br>
          <br>In an interview with 
          <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine (March 13, 1975) the interviewer, Cameron Crowe, asked Jimmy Page how important "Stairway To Heaven" was to him. Page replied: "To me, I thought 'Stairway' crystallized the essence of the band. It had everything there and showed the band at its best... as a band, as a unit. Not talking about solos or anything, it had everything there. We were careful never to release it as a single. It was a milestone for us. Every musician wants to do something of lasting quality, something which will hold up for a long time and I guess we did it with 'Stairway.' Townshend probably thought that he got it with 
          <b>Tommy</b>. I don't know whether I have the ability to come up with more. I have to do a lot of hard work before I can get anywhere near those stages of consistent, total brilliance."

          Many novice guitarists try to learn this song, and most end up messing it up. In the movie 
          <i>Wayne's World</i>, it is banned in the guitar shop where Wayne (Mike Myers) starts playing it. If you saw the movie in theaters, you heard Wayne play the first few notes of the song before being scolded and pointed to a sign that says "NO Stairway To Heaven" (Wayne: "No Stairway. Denied."). Because of legal issues - apparently even a few notes of "Stairway To Heaven" have to be cleared, and good luck with that - the video and TV releases of the movie were changed so Wayne plays something incomprehensible. This novice guitar Stairway cliché later showed up on an episode of 
          <i>South Park</i> when the character Towelie tries to play the song in a talent show and screws it up.

          Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones decided not to use a bass on this because it sounded like a folk song. Instead, he added a string section, keyboards and flutes. He also played wooden recorders that were used on the intro. Bonham's drums do not come in until 4:18.

          Robert Plant is a great admirer of all things mystic, the old English legends and lore and the writings of the Celts. He was immersed in the books 
          <i>Magic Arts in Celtic Britain</i> by Lewis Spence and 
          <i>The Lord Of The Rings</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien. The Tolkien inspiration can be heard in the phrase, "In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees," which could be a reference to the smoke rings blown by the wizard Gandalf. There is also a correlation between the lady in the song and the character from the book, Lady Galadriel, the Queen of Elves who lives in the golden forest of Lothlorien. In the book, all that glittered around her was in fact gold, as the leaves of the trees in the forest of Lothlorien were golden.

          Led Zeppelin played this for the first time in Belfast on March 5, 1971 - Northern Ireland was a war zone at the time and there was rioting in nearby streets.

And I thought, 'This is incredible because no one's heard this number yet. This is the first time hearing it!' It obviously touched them, so I knew there was something with that one."

          The acoustic, fingerpicking intro is very similar to the song "
          <a href="http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=40309">Taurus</a>" from the band Spirit, who toured with Led Zeppelin when they first played the US. "Taurus" is a guitar instrumental written by the group's guitarist, Randy California, and included on their debut album in 1968. It was part of the band's set and Jimmy Page admitted that he owned the album.
          <br>
          <br>Randy California never took any legal action against Led Zeppelin or sought compensation from them. A mercurial man who drowned in 1997 at age 45, he was described by his bandmate Mark Andes as "kind of a pathetic, tortured genius."
          <br>
          <br>The "Stairway" connection is just a small piece of the Spirit story. California was guitar prodigy, and when he was 15 he joined Jimi Hendrix in the group Jimmy James And The Blue Flames. Three months later, Hendrix went to England. He wanted to take California with him, but Randy's age made it impossible. 
          <br>
          <br>Randy played with future Steely Dan founder Walter Becker in the Long Island band Tangerine Puppets, then moved to Los Angeles where he formed Spirit with three friends and his step-father, Ed Cassidy, who played drums. They got some gigs at the Whisky a Go Go, and Lou Adler signed them to his label, Ode Records. Their first album was a modest success, but mustered just one minor hit: "Mechanical World." Written by band members Mark Andes and Jay Ferguson, it stalled at #123 US. California set out to write a hit for their second album, 
          <b>The Family That Plays Together</b> (1969) and came up with "I Got A Line On You," which made #25.
          <br>
          <br>It would be their biggest hit: the band declined an invitation to Woodstock and fractured in 1972, with California's already volatile mental health ravaged by drug use. The band reunited from time to time, but never got their due. By the time of California's death, few remembered "Taurus" and its connection to "Stairway To Heaven," but in 1999 Songfacts went online and the discussion was revived.
          <br>
          <br>In 2002, a former music journalist named Michael Skidmore came into control of California's estate, and 2014 he began proceedings against Led Zeppelin. In 2016, Jimmy Page testified in the case and said that the first time he heard of the controversy when a few years earlier when his son-in-law told him that a debate had been brewing online. Page insisted he had never heard "Taurus" before, and that it was "totally alien" to him.
          <br>
          <br>The jury didn't buy the argument that Page never heard "Taurus," but ruled in favor of Led Zeppelin, deciding that the chord progression in "Taurus" was common to many other songs dating back decades, and therefore, in the public domain. Here's a

ASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, refuses to release exact figures on how many times it has been played since its release, but figure that on each AOR station in America, the song was played five times a day during its first three months of existence; twice a day for the next nine months; once a day for the next four years; and two to three times a week for the next 15 years. There are roughly 600 AOR and Classic Rock stations in the US, which means that "Stairway" has been broadcast a minimum of 2,874 times.

         <span class="commentext">Hi Music lovers,<br><br>I think Robert, the writer of the lyrics of this song, wrote the lyrics by choose the death of Janis Joplin in Oct. 1970. Because what he wrote shows us that some ideas of Janis. Take a look at the lyrics. It says that 'There is a lady who's sure all that gillters is gold and she's buying a stairway to heaven.' I think that's enough to understand that the lirics shows about Janis'. Because the image of Janis was that she seemed to wear accessories a lot shining like gold on her at that time and she passed away. I hope it makes sense, too.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Hi Music lovers,<br><br>There were two tragedies happened in 1970 before the song was released in 1971. Two big tragedies! First was a death of Jimi Hendrix, Sep. 1970. The other one was Janis Joplin, Oct. 1970. What if that the press wrote a headline that says 'The Day The Music Die' and that two young men knew about this tragedies and thought they wanted to write a song about this each other. Then Don Mclean wrote a song 'American Pie' and Robert wrote a song 'Stairway To Heaven'.<br><br>To be continued,</span>

         <span class="commentext">Hi Music lovers,<br><br>As I wrote it below last time, thes song 'Stairway' AND 'American Pie' were written by the same idea happening in 1970. Then what's happening in 1970 ANYWAY? There must be some hints in the lyrics oft the song 'Stairway'. Because the traces remain! How about the first three lines above from the beginning of the song that saying 'There's a lady who sure All the glitters is gold and she's buying a stairway to heaven'. I think that these hints are enough to understand where the idea of the song came from.' So forget about the rest of the lyrics of the song, okey!<br>The key words of these likes are 'A lady' or 'All the glitters' or 'Gold'. Who do you think SHE WAS in 1970 anyway? Or 'she's buying a stairway to heaven' MEANS she actually died at that time! So that does make sense, anyway !<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>To be continued.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Hi Music Lovers,<br><br>I think that the idea of the lyrics of the song came from the same idea of being written as the lyrics of the song called 'American Pie' in 1971 by Don McLean. I mean Both songs 'Stairway To Heaven' and 'Ameican Pie' were happened to released almost the same time in the end of 1971. If you are interested in the idea of the writing of the song 'American Pie', please look into it on this blog, Songfacts. <br><br>At first, I thought the song writer of the song 'Stairway', Robert Plant, heard the song 'American Pie' in 1971 and he wrote the song 'Stairway' but both songs were released almost the same period of time in late 1971. That means it was impossible to write and record and release it in late 1971. then I think that they happened to get the same idea of the writing of the lyrics of the song. But what still puzzled me was that there were some key words on the lyrics of the songs on that album released by Led Zeppelin in 1971. For example, the word 'Book of love' on the song 'Rock n Roll', or the last song of the album 'When levee Breaks'. Because there were same words on the song 'American Pie', too. What does that mean? I still don't get it. If it happened coincidence, it was possible. But possibility was very rare, I think. <br><br>To be continued...</span>

         <span class="commentext">I have a deep respect for music in general and this song in particular. I'd like to offer some overall perspective from the 50.000 foot level. <br><br>Music, and its meaning, is to some degree a mirror, which reflects the listener's current state of mind at the time they hear a performance or read the lyrics, their attitude about life, and their past experience.<br><br>Likewise, music reflects the consciousness of its Creator(s) at the time it was created, along with their past experience and their intention, as expressed in the lyrics or performance.<br><br>So, in some sense, this song means something different to everyone. Our lives reflect what we continually think about, all the things we take in, such as food, TV, ideas, beliefs, habits, people.<br><br>This thread is full of people with different backgrounds and mindsets. One thing you have in common, in greater or lesser degree, is a degree of interest. You are thinking and engaged in the composition and possible meanings.<br><br>That being said, some meanings embedded in this song became obvious to me in the mid 1970s. Surprisingly, the comments do not address some metaphorical or metaphysical aspects, and do not consider important cultural movements that were contemporaneous during the time of the initial creation and release of Stairway to Heaven.<br><br>To reiterate - the meaning of this song lies in your life experience, your day to day mindset, and your degree of intentional attention directed at this song.<br><br>In my humble opinion, YES, Stairway to Heaven is a masterpiece, with deep and enduring meanings, as well as offering practical advice for improving your life. And, as Robert Plant once expressed to a concert audience, STH is truly "A Song of Hope."</span>

         <span class="commentext">The words to this Led Zepplin song, "Stairway To Heaven" has always been shrouded in mystery and that for several generations. The first time I heard it, I was thought it pretty cool, but didn't understand it. It sounded as if a lady who had money wanted to buy her way into heaven -- with that said, that's about all I understood of the song that seemed rather dark at the seams, with it's mystical, ambiguous language, all the while speaking about "heaven".<br><br>Led Zepplin became popular when I still in high school and I was rather off put by their lyrics and their on stage persona...I liked rock n roll as much as the next kid did, but their lyrics seemed overtly sexual in nature. At 16 I was still a virgin and I found them to be just a little too in your face. Interestingly enough, I heard an interview with the group, "Heart" (the Wilson sisters) and it was funny because they said they attended a Led Zep concert in their youth and experienced the same reaction I had! They too were repelled by certain Zepplin's lyrics.<br><br>At the same time, I instinctively knew that these guys were hugely unique and talented. They were going to set a trend in music and they did. Robert Plant had an uncanny voice with unearthly range and Jimmy Page played like no other. The four of them together created a hauntingly, uncharted, wild and amazing sound. My fave of theirs was "Kashmir" and "Immigrant"<br><br>Now all this talk about the occult and back masking may sound very weird and possibly a boat load of silliness, however, one can not be attracted to the likes of Alleister Crowley (like Jimmy Page was) and not be drawn in to the darkness he lived within. Read about Mr. Crowley and the things he did. Do the research. Page was so taken with Alleister Crowley he bought his home! With that said there is no mistaking the symbolism embedded in Zep's albums. Words and things have meaning and both Page and Plant meant them to have meaning. I'm not saying that Plant consciously understood that he was being influenced, but he was just the same. It is not coincidental listening to "Stairway" backwards that the name of "Satan" surfaces 6 times. I don't believe it was either Robert Plant's or Page's intention to glorify Satan, but the dark side seems to always reveal itself in unexpected, shadowy ways.<br><br>Just as an aside, Robert Plant's reaction to Heart playing "Stairway To Heaven" at the Kennedy Center, in the band's honor, was probably more of discomfort and pain. Many felt that he was deeply touched by all the performances in their honor, but when Heart got up to sing, "Stairway" Robert Plant appeared very uncomfortable -- almost horrified. Yes, he was deeply moved, but I believe it was unsettling for him and he may or may not understand WHY, although I think he understands. (Of course, this is conjecture on my part - but I found Plant's reaction to hearing the song just a little odd - even though he did manage an eye tear for it, overwhelmed at the sheer magnitude of effort that was put in to the performing presentation.) From all I've gathered and read concerning this song and the way it came about, I don't believe Robert Plant is comfortable with it and would rather not have to remember the song that ironically made them famous.<br><br>Jesus said that Satan is the "prince of this world" and so it is. Sadly, both Plant, Page and Bonham paid a dear and painful price for what they permitted themselves to be influenced by (whether consciously or unconsciously), thus their fame and fortune -- because the angel of light will always demand some form of collateral exchange. <br><br>Led Zepplin will go down in history as the most amazingly talented song writers and bands ever! They truly put out memorable music that changed an entire generation of musicians and song writers as they were the Pied Pipers who led many a young soul to the beautiful side of the occult and paganism.</span>

         <span class="commentext">I watched DVD The Song Remains The Same for the first time in January 2016. I got chills seeing the pre-9/11 Twin Towers/World Trade Center in the film just before Stairway To Heaven is performed. I remember the day the Towers were destroyed like it was yesterday, and seeing them still standing just before a moving song is about to be played breaks my heart all over again.</span>

         <span class="commentext">This song is very inspired / in-spirit. Many writers, oh hell, many humans are inspired with wisdom that they themselves sometimes don't even know the significance of, at least not when first inspired. <br><br>Are the words satanic? I'd say not. Are they occult? Could very well be. But most people wrongly associate the occult with satanism. <br><br>The meaning of the occult has been lost to most people, as has the word origin / the true vibration of many words. Human language, along with many other part of human life had gotten corrupted over time. Some would say occult means "that which is hidden." Well, it did indeed become hidden because there were power hungry people who did indeed want to use the power of the occult but don't want others to do so. So, they wanted to hide it away for themselves and they would literally kill anyone else who knew of it, so that was plenty enough reason for everyone else to hide it away. <br><br>But the origin of the word "occult" means the "cult / culture" of "oc / ak". Occult means the culture of light. <br><br>And even Life itself tends to reserve the disclosure of occult meaning only to those who truly want it. They may not even think of the culture of light as going by that word "occult" but if people truly desire and intend to get to the truth of life and this world and beyond, then such will over time be revealed to them. <br><br>But if someone does not truly desire to know and understand, then not even the truth knocking at their door or provided on a silver platter will get through to them. <br><br>We are in a world of duality and this song flat says it itself - two paths to take - so either you are moving towards the light or away from it. One way to think of light is knowingness and not necessarily in a logical sort of way (although not denying that either) but more in an intuitive knowingness. And the complement would be darkness, which could be interpreted as ignorance, which ultimately results in disempowerment. <br><br>So, with this as a back drop. I'll interpret these song lyrics. <br><br>There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold<br>And she's buying a stairway to heaven.<br>When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed<br>With a word she can get what she came for.<br>Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.<br><br><br>In this context "gold" refers to materialism. This lady is trying to buy her way into heaven, basically trying to buy her happiness and joy through material things and lots of them. <br><br><br>There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure<br>'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.<br><br>When it comes right down to it, these lines are as much for the listener of the song as for the character in the song. They tell you that that is exactly what is going on here - same words having two meanings. And the lady of the song knows this too - is the "sign" she is seeing telling her one thing or something completely different, is she interpreting the "signs", the subtle divine guidance, correctly?<br><br><br>In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,<br>Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.<br><br>In this world of illusion and darkness / ignorance / unknowingness, it's easy to have doubt and apprehension. <br><br><br>There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,<br>And my spirit is crying for leaving.<br><br>The west is associated with endings or death, "my spirit" is crying to leave this world. This is not the spirit's natural world but is an illusion for the sake of experience. <br><br><br>In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,<br>And the voices of those who stand looking.<br><br>I'll say I'm not sure of exactly how to interpret these lines but I'll go ahead and say that the divine has many ways to send you messages and I've often joked that for those who refuse to "see" the signs, who deny the guidance, I'll say, "How many more ways can the message get sent to you? What is left? Smoke signals?"<br><br><br>And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,<br>Then the piper will lead us to reason.<br><br>If we ask for guidance, we will get it. "Ask and ye shall receive." <br><br><br>And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,<br>And the forests will echo with laughter.<br><br>A new day, a new creation will indeed manifest for those who commit themselves to its creation, then there will indeed be much joyous laughter. <br><br><br>If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,<br>It's just a spring clean for the May queen.<br><br>If there is a stirring beneath the surface, inside you, it's a chance to clean and purify yourself. Flow with it. <br><br><br>Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run<br>There's still time to change the road you're on.<br><br>In this world of duality, a free-will realm, you can move to the light or away from the light, but even if you've chosen darkness, albeit perhaps unconsciously, you can always choose again and turn back to the light. <br><br><br>Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,<br>The piper's calling you to join him,<br><br>When you catch the "spark", when you get some clue of the divine message, you just can't shake it, it does indeed make your head hum and the divine is calling you to follow its guidance. <br><br><br>Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know<br>Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?<br><br>The divine guidance is often subtle. Are you tuned in to catch that subtle guidance?<br><br><br>And as we wind on down the road<br>Our shadows taller than our soul.<br><br>Sometimes as we move through our earthly lives, we move further into darkness / ignorance / disempowerment and further away from our conscious awareness of our souls. <br><br><br>There walks a lady we all know<br>Who shines white light and wants to show<br>How everything still turns to gold.<br><br>But someone / something / the divine / life itself wants to shine the light for you and show you... gold! And in this case, here is a word already used in this song, which now has a different meaning, just like the lyrics told you some words have. Early in the lyrics it meant money and materialism, but now it's more to do with alchemy, with turning lead into gold, which is a metaphor for changing a mundane level human into a god, which is their true essence. And "Hu" was a god and hence "hu-man" means "god-man". <br><br><br>And if you listen very hard<br>The tune will come to you at last.<br><br>If you learn to recognize the divine's subtle guidance you will indeed hear it. <br><br><br>When all are one and one is all<br><br>When you again realize your own personal wholeness and unity, then also see your unity with all else, but this order is significant - unify all parts of your own individuation first - recognize and reconnect with your soul and your creative powers - then you can truly unify with other beings. <br><br><br>To be a rock and not to roll.<br><br>Be committed, firm, diligent in knowing the truth, in knowing your true divine and powerful self, be a rock...and in not getting caught back up into the world of illusion and distraction that wants to keep you from being your powerful and divine self, do not roll back into ignorance and disempowerment and separation from the divine / spirit / your soul. <br><br><br>And she's buying a stairway to heaven. <br><br>And that is the true way to heaven.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Jimmy had already recorded some demos of the acoustic introduction in October 1970, during their second stay at Bron-yr-Aur. Part of the track already existed before the band went to Headley Grange to prepare and record the album, but the final composition (notably Plant's lyrics) and the arrangements were completed in Headley.<br><br>Although Jimmy's famous guitar solo for the studio version of the song was done on his Fender Telecaster, in order to be able to play this masterpiece in concert, he bought what was to become one of the icons of the band, namely the famous Gibson (EDS-1275 Doubleneck), featuring 12 strings on the upper neck and 6 on the other (the 6-string neck was used for the arpeggio in the introduction and the solo, the 12-string neck for the rest of the song), which was a heavy equipment to carry in concert. Contrary to what is often read, Jimmy Page didn't have this model made to measure for himself: it has been in Gibson's catalogue since 1958, but it had remained distributed on a confidential basis until Jimmy made it famous. John McLaughlin, for instance, had used it before him.<br><br>There are no satanist hidden messages neither in "Stairway To Heaven," nor in "Hotel California" by the Eagles or other songs 'accused' of containing hidden messages when played backwards (even if some deliberated cases do exist, such as "Empty Spaces" by Pink Floyd and "Fire On a High" by Electric Light Orchestra). These rumors were launched in California by a committee of puritan parents and religious leaders who wanted to show that rock 'n' roll was leading children to satanism. They listened to dozen and dozen of tracks backwards (!) , hoping to find evidence in line with the above.</span>

         <span class="commentext">I love this song. I think that music and any other kind of art doesn't have (need) to be original, I mean, I don't think originality ever existed. Many people along the centuries had made many works of art too much similar, if it had some difference it depended to the culture of each people in world. So to finish, I don't care. And about these "occultism references", I don't understand any kind of those things. But what I think it's interesting, that many european people enjoy (can I put this word?) the occultism and it's like a taboo etc. I would to understand what makes them to turn to the occult side, not only about this song, but to many more.</span>

         <span class="commentext">The lyrics of this song are simply littered with veiled references to Satanism, such as changing from the Stairway To Heaven and going along a different route, and actually contain clues that there is a backward message on the song. What about 'If you listen very hard, the tune will come to you at last', for instance? Also, the numerous references to whispering in the song are also probably meant to indicate that there has been a backward message whispered onto it. And another thing what about the 'Four Symbols' on the album cover? What are they supposed to represent? It is a known fact that Rush, who received much of their musical inspiration from Led Zeppelin, feature a Pentagram, or Satanic symbol, on some of their album covers.</span>

         <span class="commentext">We 're sure that Robert Plant grow up with a lot of poems. I suppose he inspired by "Twelve Lays of a Gypsy" wrote by Kostes Palamas , a greek poet. In this poem Palamas describes a gypsy woman who knows everything about the future. [basically she can tell you everything if you pay her with gold -There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold..Who shines white light and wants to show how everything still turns to gold]<br>The poem starts with this :<br>"Though the interwoven shadows<br>Crept an evanescent gleam <br>Mingled still with night<br>And it was my mind's own dawning <br>Of the light"<br>In Greek language ιt is clear that it talks about a lady , describes her as a "gleam"<br>But the most important part of this poem is below [unfortunately I couldn't find a translated English book for this]<br>"The love of God will regrets you,<br>and a new dawn will come,<br>[And a new day will dawn for those who stand long]<br>and the redemption will call you<br>[The piper's calling you to join him]<br>Οh soul beaten by the pity,<br>[my spirit is crying for leaving]<br>and you will hear the saviors' calling<br>[The tune will come to you at last]<br>you will undress the cloth of sin,<br>[Our shadows taller than our soul]<br>and again, ruled and free,<br>you will loiter like grass, like the birds,<br>[tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,etc]<br>like a woman's stature, like a wave,<br>you don't have another stair (rung) below <br>you will roll too deep<br>[To be a rock and not to roll]<br>on the stair of bad<br>and climbing again calls you, <br>you will feel your wings to grow<br>The wings that you first used to have,<br>the big ones."</span>

         <span class="commentext">A couple of thoughts about "Stairway," which I have enjoyed ever since I first heard it. Yes, Page was into Crowley and all that occultist nonsense. He purchased his mansion and even took up his unfortunate heroin addiction. But here is the important point people seem to overlook: PLANT WROTE THE LYRICS! Even if you want to buy the "backward masking" theory -- which both Plant and Page (who produced the album) swear up and down did NOT occur -- the author of the lyrics had nothing to do with Satanism. Full stop.<br><br>Secondly, for the definitive cover version of "Stairway," look no further than Frank Zappa's 1988 band, which features a note-for-note rendition of Page's solo by a full horn section! Trust me, you will not be disappointed.</span>

         <span class="commentext">What baffles me about this song is that so many people say this song is "Satanic" because some one listened to this song backwards and thought that it sounded SIMILAR to some Satanic message. What I have to say about all of this is that the song wasn't recorded to be played and interpreted backwards. It almost ruins the song completely. I think that it shows stupidity in full frontal view. Don't get me wrong, this song is definitely one of if not the greatest song to ever be recorded, but don't come to me saying, " Led Zeppelin and similar bands ( Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, etc.) are Satanic.", because it is just simple an over-examination of the bands and their material. Why don't we all just listen to the greatest band of all time without making false claims made with little to no evidence of the accusations. Please reply if you think along the same lines or if you wish to attempt to prove me wrong. Thanks</span>

         <span class="commentext">..Re: If played backwards, the line "Yes there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run...there's still time to change the road you're on" goes as follows: "My sweet Satan, the one will be the sad one, who makes me sad, who's power is Satan." So Robert Plant later states "To me it's very sad, because 'Stairway to Heaven' was written with every best intention" The one who planted the backwards lyrics (path) is the one (Page) who makes Robert sad. Robert's forward lyrics are on the other path; his power is not Satan -its the reverse direction up the stairway.. Common knowledge Page was following Satan at the time. He planted the backwards stuff. "My sweet satan" is how God might say it, as satan was Gods favorite angel. When connected in extreme clarity, one can sense some depth of Gods beautiful amazing universe and satans negative pull and alluring force against that...to minimize and turn our direction down the stairs, in our limited perception that what glitters is gold, etc. What glitters most is on the forward path.</span>

The songbird is singing the song called Stairway to heaven, his name is Robert. In lore the willow growing on a riverbank with its cascading leaves falling over the water is a familiar one, evoking the concept of life, death and rebirth. Misgiven means a myriad of things, here as a purposeful effort "to impart fear to; to make irresolute". Cause you know words have two (note just two) meanings indicates two directions.</span>

         <span class="commentext">I love the song, but at one point I imagined it might be intimating a different meaning than the whole satanic thing and maybe a little of the religious stuff. I think we can agree that "sometimes words have two meanins" refers to buying/bying. As she is either getting closer or purchasing the stairway to heaven. "with a word she can get what she came for, she is buying what she came for. Now here is the stretch, Zepplelin were not innocents, by that I mean they probably partied a bit. I knew Innocent myself, but I would imagine that they all experience their youth much more than I. So, I had friend in college that would just go to nature for a few days and just hang out. Smoke some bud and camp. "See the rings of smoke through the woods" so to speak. So it occurs to me that the figurative "stairway to heaven" is the act of getting high and "she" can buy it with a "word".</span>

         <span class="commentext">I believe their talking about the May Day Festivals..."The May Queen is a girl (usually a teenage girl from a specific school year) who is selected to ride or walk at the front of a parade for May Day celebrations. She wears a white gown to symbolise purity and usually a tiara or crown. Her duty is to begin the May Day celebrations. She is generally crowned by flowers and makes a speech before the dancing begins. Certain age groups dance round a Maypole celebrating youth and the spring time.<br><br>According to popular British folklore, the tradition once had a sinister twist, in that the May Queen was put to death once the festivities were over. The veracity of this belief is difficult to establish, but while in truth it might just be an example of anti-pagan propaganda, frequent associations between May Day rituals, the occult and human sacrifice are still to be found in popular culture today. The Wicker Man, a cult horror film starring Christopher Lee, is a prominent example of these associations." -Wikipedia<br>Now, i think he's talking of the innocent female that they sacrifce, his thoughts on why she would do it, and the unliying fact that they she believes in HER FAITH that she will go to heaven at the end of this Evil/Satanic festival/ritual. SHe's a Rock and stands on her beliefs instead of ROLLing along with this rest of their evil ways. Maybe she'd rather announce her faith and die for it to get away from such a nasty society of people. They can take her virtue and her life but they cant take her faith nor her spot in heaven. The Piper is the Devil. The smoke rings are a cry for help, "my spirits crying 4 leaving" he thinks about leaving this hell hole too. "can u hear the wind blow..." means dont u know their gonna murder u? theirs so many clues. "words have 2 meanings" is a clue. etc... I think The band wasnt gona reveal the truth in fear of their own lives or maybe to protect the satanic secret society. Well thats I think guys. Thanks.</span>

         <span class="commentext">There's been no end for this "satanic backmasking" debate, because it all comes down some people believe in it, some don't, but real problem is the misconception of what Satanic means. <br>You see, almost all people who posted have a visual idea that Satan followers are dark, murky, shadowy creatures who entertain by sacrificing children in late hours of night, drinking blood, performing sexual magic, or any other stereotype, and they visualise Satan as some red skinned pointy tailed horny demon that has his fun in Hell. <br>But all that is illusion. <br>You don't have to be evil to follow the will of Satan, because if Satan exist, he is a glorious angel, much more smarter, better looking and intelligent than any other being on earth, and he doesn't want to hurt people, he wants to be revered and worshipped. If he wanted to make a song that could praise him by being played backwards and forwards, he could compose it without breaking sweat. He would only have to influence some poor human to sing it in correct way, record it and that's all. Those humans even don't have to believe or worship Satan as deity, they would only have to let themselves be inspired by some powerful force. And if you look at the different arts, some of the most compelling poems and stories have been done through such inspiration ("the pen just started writing in my hand") also known as channeling. <br>And the magnificence of Stairway to Heaven is just in that fact, that the song performance as recorded on LZIV couldn't be repeated live or by other artists to get consistent backward message. Therefore most praised song in the history shouldn't be credited to mere mortals, bacause they haven't got ability, mental capacity or the artistic skill to create such backward/forward masterpiece on purpose. Therefore Plant and Page are telling the truth, it wasn't their intention to do backmasking.<br><br>But just because Satan influenced them to make this song doesn't make LZ or Stairway evil per se. <br>For believers it is also a fact that our world is ruled by Satan, so why wouldn't ANYother popular mainstream music be created by his inspiration? He is after all, greatest artist of entire universe.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Lets try &amp; settle this Satanic crap once &amp; for all. I grew up in the turn table age &amp; yes like many easily influnenced teens I bought into the backward messages. We removed the belt drive from our turn table &amp; spun the record,(Zeppelin Four, Stairway to Heaven) backwards. Once we had the correct speed we heard clear as day exactly what we were told we were going to here,(sic) My sweet Satan, etc etc. Shocked &amp; blown away we all believed that our beloved Zeppelin had sold their sould to the devil. After throwing out all of our Zeppelin Lp's, tee shirts, posters &amp; God knows what else, we as a group of young music fans turned off the Zeppelin for waht we thought would be forever. The year was 1980 &amp; as living proof to their Satanic ways, John Bohnham dies...at Jimmy Pages house no less. There it was, confirmation that the boys from Zeppelin were in fact Satan worshipers. Then...to the great delight of missinformed Zeppelin fans the world wide, this ridiculous mtyh was put to bed for good. I don't recall the name, but I can swear to you, even on a stack of Bibles, that this is true, a music professor from a university in I think Lethbridge Alberta Canada, demonstrated that the idea of backwwards messaging was achieved by the power of suggestive thinking. On National Television, he played a sample of some song I had never heard before. He played 45 seconds of the song in the normal forward manner, then he played the exact same 45 seconds backwards. He asked his TV audieince if they could make out any words when the song was played backwards, I think I recall maybe hearing a word or two, but nothing that jumped out. Then he looked right in the camera &amp; said, "listen very closely &amp; you are going to hear, Mary had a little lamb". Well he plays the sample backward &amp; just as clear as day, I, &amp; every other person watching &amp; listening that night heard, very clearly, Mary had a little lamb. The professor went on to say that if he were to suggest that we DO NOT picture a purple elelphant in a sink, we would automaticly picture it. The same rule applies for Stairway to Heaven, had we not been told what o listen for, we would not have heard the so called backward Satanic messages. Want further proof? Take any cover version of Stairway, in fact grab the least likley two versions tp contain Satanic messages, Tiny Tim &amp; Dolly Parton's versions, &amp; play them backwards at the exact same spots you think you can hear t&amp; whata ya know..you hear the same freaking thing !! Its a great song written by great musicians, period !! Good day. I said Good day !!</span>

OTOH there is evidence that Spirit themselves nicked their song from Davey Graham's acoustic version of "Cry Me a River". Graham's song was issued in 1958, ten years before "Taurus" came out. The video clip for "Cry Me a River" can be found at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeejHJxGjs It is quite clear that large sections of "Taurus" was taken from Graham's song without credit.</span>

         <span class="commentext">This song is no more about communing Satan than is amazing grace. Through our lives we are conditioned into an egoist state of mind where we view ourselves as somehow separate from the rest of the world but at the same time the center of it. It is an illusionary state in which we identify with a set of concepts, feelings, opinions, and judgments about past experiences. Then wrap it all into a big ball convince ourselves that our big ball of nothingness is a rock solid substantial thing, it is our own little shadow "reality" in which we root our identity, and we name it "ME". Then we protect our shadow reality "ME" from the other seven billion shadow reality "ME's" that have been imagined up. Our "ME" becomes our eyes and ears and it begins to think and react based on the rules of its own little reality. We feed our "ME" more ideas, concepts, opinions and judgments to make them seem even more "substantially" separate. "ME" can only perceive existence from a you vs. me, outside vs. inside, up vs. down, good vs. evil, white vs. black, good vs. bad, allies vs. enemies, boys vs. girls, rich vs. poor, heaven vs. hell… and therefore it lives in constant fear of opposing forces, yet at the same time it counts on opposing forces to bring it happiness. To attain happiness it depends on external concepts such as wealth, friends, family… and when these things disappoint it reacts with suspicion, anger, violence, hatred…. We know deep down that this is not reality so we are unsatisfied with our "me", we long for true happiness. What the "me" doesn't realize is that happiness or "heaven" is laid out right before our eyes and that every moment is perfection we just have to stop trying to see it through the conceptual, opinionated, judgmental, egocentric, eyes of ego. This song is conveying a message that shedding the conjured "me" or "ego" and coming back to reality, that understanding the oneness of the universe and that nothing is really separate and the idea of opposing forces is all in our heads, is a direct path to attaining true happiness.</span>

If you're given a sample of meaningless sound, you listen to it and cannot define anything special about it, that's what it is!

         <span class="commentext">I've read everything that's been written about this song, but I think I can add something that's never been suggested before - where the title may come from. <br><br>I've seen only two suggestions as to where it might derive from - either an earlier Neil sedaka song of the same name, or from some (vaguely) similar lyrics from an earlier Procul Harum song. both theories having been denied by Zeppelin themselves. <br><br>However, my theory (and it is only a theory) stems from the fact that Robet Plant grew up in, and has always lived in, the same part of England - namely the Worcestershire /Warwickshire region south of Birmingham - a fact confirmed by the landlord of one of his local pubs only 2 days ago. Now, only a few miles from there is a part of the Grand Union Canal (a famous waterway built in the Industrial Revolution in England) where there is a flight of 21 locks which stretches over 2 miles - and has been known as the 'Stairway to Heaven</span>

         <span class="commentext">If you play the record album backwards after the verse - "If there's a bussel in your hedgegrove don't be alarmed now it's just a sprinkling for the may queen, yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run there's still time to change the road your on" (forgive me if I don't have all the lyrics right) - you'll here definite and obvious references to satan ("satan is the one," etc. etc.). I'm not joking, I grew up during the era of record albums and we used to play it backwards all the time, unfortunately you can't do it with CD's, but if you get the record album and a turntable you'll hear it, it's very clear. Now whether this makes them satanists or it was just some marketing thing by the record company I don't know, but it's definitely there.</span>

I think he made the messages so people would hear about the messages and go out and buy the album. And that's also why they didn't release it as a single, so people had to buy the whole album! And BTW i think that everything Jimmy from Boleskin House, UK, said was true. But when you get to the end of it, read his name again. LOL. <br><br>P.S. I LOVE LED ZEPPELIN!</span>

         <span class="commentext">LED ZEPPELIN's Zoso (pronounced Sozo) album has a hierglyphic which is a stylized 666. Led Zeppelin is satanic to the <br>core. The band introduced personal occult symbols on one of their albums. Guitarist Jimmy Page of Zeppelin is a devout <br>follower of Satanist, Aleister Crowley, who proclaimed himself as "The Beast 666." Aleister Crowley was also a 33rd and 97th <br>Degree Freemason and is recognized as the master Satanist of the 20th century. In 1971, guitarist Jimmy Page bought <br>Crowley's Boleskine House on the shore of Loch Ness where Crowley practiced his hellish, satanic sex-magick rituals, <br>including human sacrifices. Guitarist Jimmy Page actually performed Crowley magical rituals during their concerts. Their <br>song "Stairway to Heaven" carries the reference "May Queen," which is the name of a hideous poem by Crowley. Page <br>had inscribed in the vinyl of their album Led Zeppelin III, Crowley's famous "Do what thou wilt. So mete it Be.' Page and <br>Robert Plant claim some of Zeppelins' songs came via occultic "automatic handwriting," including their popular "Stairway <br>to Heaven." Stephen Davis in the Hammer of the Gods, details the occult inspiration of "Stairway to Heaven." "Robert described <br>the 'automatic' nature of the lyric: 'I was just sitting there with Pagey in front of a fire at Headley Grange. Pagey had written the <br>chords and played them for me. I was holding a paper and pencil, and for some reason, I was in a very bad mood. Then all of a <br>sudden my hand was writing out words. 'There's a lady who's sure, all that glitters is gold, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.' <br>I just sat there and looked at the words and then I almost leaped out of my seat.'" (Stephen Davis, Hammer of the Gods, p. 164).<br>One line of the song, says, "you know sometimes words have TWO MEANINGS." They should know -- the song is <br>drenched in satanic backmasking! One part when played forward, says: "Yes, their are two paths you can go by, but in the long <br>run there's still time to change the road you're on." But when played backwards, you clearly hear: There's no escaping it, oh it's <br>my sweet Satan, the one whose path makes me sad, whose power is Satan." Oh I will sing because I live with Satan." <br>Some of the words, typical of witch language, having a double-meaning. The line: "And when you wind on down the road, the <br>shadow's taller than your soul," means that Satan is supposed to be stronger than us. Page said it was taken from the writings of <br>a Druid priest, hundreds of years ago. Other parts of the song, when played in reverse, say: "I live for Satan," "The Lord turns me <br>off," "Here is to my sweet Satan," "There's power in Satan," and "Take the 666." <br>This is the number one song in rock history! Just a coincidence -- not hardly!</span>

         <span class="commentext">That thing about Aliester Crowley's house and Page is so overdone and misleading. Crowley is actually quite misunderstood. He was really experimenting with expanding his own spiritual horizons, and thought that the way to do it was by summoning dark spirits and trying to convert them to respect goodness. He thought that this would give him a reward and lead to his finding his own higher spiritual self - what some people refer to as a "Spirit Guide". Look it up - that's what he was about. I don't follow Crowley personally, but he's not the big bad wolf people make him out to be. Maybe just a little eccentric. Because Jimmy Page bought the house formerly owned by Aleister Crowley doesn't mean anything in my opinion. All that garbage about Page and Stairway being played backwards is so unfortunate. I think Page really bought Boleskine House for the view of the Loch if you ask me. I am a big student of Page's music, and I see him as a kind and gentle man, who broadened all of our horizons with his timeless music and songwriting. Nobody writes or plays like Page does, regardless of where people say he parked his car in the 80's. And who wouldn't take the chance to record at Headley Grange? Apparently the acoustics are fabulous! If you listen to the song "Bad Company" The whole Led Zeppelin IV album and Fleetwood Mac's "Rumors", you can hear that there is a special quality to recordings made there. I love stairway To Heaven - and I tend to see it as a positive and bright song rather than a negative one. Personally, I don't see where that other perception comes from.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Well, first off, the song is very real, both forwards and backwards. That does not make this song a satanically inspired song though. Perhaps the opposite is true. Let's look at the deeper meanings which the artists are depicting to uncover the realities in the song. We notice is speaks of a lady or nation, dressed in Jewels whom has glorified herself in her wealth. She has glorified herself so much that she thinks she can buy her way into heaven with her wealth. Only to find out that heaven on earth or the millennial reign of the Messiah will not allow her to purchase her way out, all the stores are closed for her. Her wealth means nothing how. With all her magicians and soothsayers, she attempts to read the signs on the wall through ancient Babylonian druidic rituals, but they fail her as she can not interpret the dual meanings of the lyrics in the music and mysteries of the signs. However a song bird sings of all our collective thoughts. As they look to the West, towards America, Mystery, Babylon, the lady dressed in Jewels, our spirits cry to leave us, for dread of the horror she brings on the earth. In the thoughts of each other we have see rings of smoke in the trees representing the voices of those whom stand on watch. The whispers come out to call us all in tune, and harmony. The someday for those who stand long, the piper will lead us all to reason. When that day arrives, and the woman is not allowed to buy her way into heaven on earth, the forest will echo with our laughter. If there is a bustle in your hedgerow or normal routine on earth, don't be alarmed. It is just a spring clean for the May queen whom comes to purify the earth of all the Satanic forces. Yes, there are always two paths you can go by, but there is time still to change from the bad one you may be on. Yes people, your head is humming and you won't go, because you don't know the master piper is calling you to join him. Dear lady of wealth can hear the wind blow, as she carries you every which way but right. You don't know, because your stairway lies on the whispering wind, which does not go to heaven. You can not buy your way in. The truth has now come to us, now that we are all one. We know who the lady is now, collectively, America in the West. So the message here is do not follow the Babylonian Harlot, America, whom is steep Babylonian rituals trying to read the signs on the wall as ancient druids did. <br><br>When we play it backwards we see the other half of the story. There is an entire poem enclosed in the song from beginning to end also, very incredible. These men must be masters of some ancient elder group which rarely appears on earth. We see hints of it in Kashmir as we read these lyrics they can make us understand. Oh let the sun beat down upon my face <br>With stars to fill my dream. <br>I am a traveler of both time and space <br>To be where I have been. <br><br>To sit with elders of a gentle race <br>This world has seldom seen. <br>They talk of days for which they sit and wait <br>When all will be revealed.<br><br>All is revealed when the wealthy Lady whom has glorified herself in her wealth finds she can not buy her way into the eternal kingdom on earth, soon to come. The forest will echo with laughter as those whom have stood long have waited for their time to come...Backwards we can look at the famous part for times sake. If there's a bustle in your hedgerow <br>Don't be alarmed now <br>It's just a spring clean <br>For the May queen <br><br>Yes, there are two paths you can go by <br>But in the long run <br>There's still time to change <br>The road you're on<br><br>Backwards this reads, So, Here's to my sweet Satan. There was a little child born who made me sad who's power is faith. He'll (Satan not the child) will give to those with him six, six, six. There was a little toolshed where he made us, (combined with the child) suffer, sad, sad Satan, stating mocking Satan. Apparently, the child is a child and Satan was a man when this suffering in the tool shed took place. The tool shed is a depiction of them being forged by the master's hand that allowed Satan to bring suffering to them and the child. Most likely as the apokolypcia rolls in, Satan will make many believe the child or younger is Satan and that he is the Christ. The child will not claim God Status by will merely be a prophet. If one reads the entire backward story, this is pretty much the message conveyed. The beginning of the backward song has this in it, which is the end of the forward song, Plaaaay backwards, <br>Hear why its sung here, oppositioner.. <br>Allll on track, all arriving <br>They all sing, and they are one. <br>Shall I loathe you now, parishoner? <br>Oh hear Him, Christian within me. <br>It stirs my sin; the river, <br>Oh, she swells with our lousiness. <br>All my life will end for him? <br>We're all out of signs, <br>I know I'm sorta shocked <br>To hear The Lord, <br>My God now will save me! <br>Oh I will n'er be saved, <br>Because I live with Satan.. <br>One wish today; <br>That you'll all pray for <br>Three who will make it here late. <br>Pray now and you'll see.. <br>The 'Lord' turned me on, <br>But, oh, I was the shaggy fool.. <br>Clothed in agony, <br>Lost at a height. <br>There's no escaping it, <br>Nor his woes.. <br>So here's to my Sweet Satan<br><br><br>The end of the backward song or poem ends as such, <br><br>He, who say the lords <br>Thoth have our laws, <br>Maat must be superb. Mass is ended.. <br>Over there, <br>He who should learn thee. <br>Any moot that serves by my sworn music, <br>I wish it with snow be shushed, <br>All for my mass's sake. <br>Hear why its sung, <br>here, oppositioner, Ohh.. <br>He who should show <br>May make his show worthy, <br>To look, for us, odd.. sickly, <br>There's one chance - take his show. <br>Hold thy head, <br>Hear why its sung here. oppositioner. <br>Who owns this earth built below? <br>Oh sweet Israel...<br><br>The poem backwards is much wordier than forwads. This is only about half of the poem backwards. It seems to carry a rather Godly meaning, hidden by men whom you would least expect to possess it. These men are masters of an elder race which seldom appears on earth. They are a collective group of chosen people whom have the same experiences, desires, pursuits, and preferences. They are in unison and synchronicity. In the end, they will be victorious over Satan and six, six, six as they have stood long to be where they will be. They are gentle elders of all time and space whom seldom appear. In their songs, they talk of days for which they sit and wait, when all will be revealed. That is scary stuff; I do not think I would want to mess with these guys or their God or prophet of whom they speak, whom Satan apposes as well as he apposes Israel.</span>

         <span class="commentext">As a singer,musician, and songwriter I have learned to play this song and do believe the composition and progression of the music is absolutely brilliant. However, as much as I love the song, I do know for a fact there are hidden subliminal messages in the song. I experimented with many records and found that the messages really are there in this song, and many other songs including Beatles Revolution #9, and Revelation #9 by Marilyn Manson. Backmasking is an easy recording technique that has been experimented with since the 50's. You can learn more at: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backmasking) If you play this song backwards,your only going to hear jibberish if you don't do it right. You have play it backwards right at the part in the song that says: ''If there's a bustle in your hedgegrow don't be alarmed now. It's just spring cleening for the May Queen. Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the longrun, there's still time to change the road you're on.''<br>Why would Led Zep put subliminal messages in a song? Not sure. Artist have always experimented with all types of new ideas and new techniques in music. Do backward messages effect you even though you can't hear it? The near-consensus among research psychologists is that subliminal messages do not produce a powerful, enduring effect on behavior; and that laboratory research reveals little effect beyond a subtle, fleeting effect on thinking.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subliminal_message) Another words, there are not long term effects caused from the messages, but there may be some short term effects on thinking. However,that is when the song is played once. There hasn't been any research on the effects after listening to a song thousands of times. It's my personal belief that it could possibly effect your thinking significantly after thousands of plays. I'm not going to chance it. I don't listen to this song anymore. It is a beautiful song though. I love to play this on my guitar.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Ok,ok, OK!!! Good People Regarding The Devil in Music:"Backwards Masking" is a Technical way to add subliminal, as in the case of ELO, "messages" into music tracks.<br>After years of tripping on this Stairway story I have come to the grand conclusion that aside from Jimmy Page, the band, Eddie Kramer, or Peter Grant did not intentionally add the 6 references to "Satan" in the song. I believe this is a natural occurrence of a very dark forces at work here. The conscious motor hears things in a forward motion while the subconscious hears things in a reverse motion. You can hear many clear examples of this with audible words coming forth whilst played backwards. The fact that Stairway has at least 6 "Satans" audible in it--all produced from Different words sung forwards discludes the idea of a certain word reversed. Example: the word Natas. The odds of 6 "Satans" occurring are ASTRONOMICAL which lead me to believe they were attached to Plant via a demonic force--not unlike a temporary possession. Yes, people can be parasitically attached to, unfortunately, by evil meanies. The fact that at that time, Crowley's backward discovery was well known to Pagey, who we all know was literally a young man swimming, proficiently i might add, in a great sea of dark forces. Even David Bowie was, for a time in the early seventies, quoted as such, "to record things backward". Little children can be recorded forward and meaningful sentences can present themselves backwards. It's just part of our complex communication process that is only recently being delved into and discovered. Of course Robert Plant wasn't singing about Christianity's "Devil" Satan, the "light bearer closest angel to "God"--but in reverse you can clearly(that's open to your definition of clarity and experience listening in reverse) hear the word "Satan" and also "he will give you 666" as well as a few other complete sentences. The actual deep lorists believe the entire song is a complete piece of demonic messages coming through from some dark force. As is claimed also to "Battle of Evermore". Why is 666 so important??? Because my children, 666= The Chip that is already here and waiting to be put into you-your physical body! by Big Pharma world wide via nano technology. Why do children get 20-25 shots by the age of 6 these days? BECAUSE, they, The New World Order evil meanies, have plans for all of us in the order of enslavement thru computer tech, etc. It's not about money, they already control that. It's about power..control, of us!<br>Stairway To Heaven was heard, over and over and over again by an entire generation..getting into our minds to accept the chip..or 666. I know this suggests i am a nut..but I'm not. If you have an old turntable, simply take out the belt and manually-using your finger or a pencil-turn the album backwards right around the lyric, "it's just a sprinkling for the May Queen" and continue along to hear, at different speeds, a wall in harmony of demonic voices all crying out to their Satan who will give you 666. Another way to hear this on a PC is to use the Sound Recorder built into Windows Accessories and pull up your studio version of Stairway.mp3. You can play it backwards at a steady speed and hear much of it. Remember, many of the messages or sentences are like listening to words being spoken with very varying speed changes so it takes a little time to actually hear alot of it. "Here's to my sweet Satan", does tho, literally jump out at you so don't freak out, ok? Again, i think this is natural evil-not using tech devices to do it-that got onto the song backwards, through Plant's voice, from Page's direct connection and heavy involvement with evil meanies. I, myself, am Not a big bible guy, i see and feel and connect with Diety, the God Force, the faces of God as Joseph Campbell would say, in nature, positive vibrations, and good intent from good hearts, dogs included. i think we all, all of us living things, rocks included!, have an eternal connection with "God" so I'm not really worried the "Devil" is going to get my soul n spirit, my life force. I Do Believe, tho, that there is an ongoing agenda, brought forth in an infinite number of ways, specifically designed to "get me". So i am wary of VeriChip and any other company that wants to eventually enslave me. As a guitarist, i can't help but dig on Led Zep, forwards!! but as a seeker and longtime observer, and indeed longtime participant, in many things deemed "occult"(hidden or unknown) I do see Black Arts written all over anything Jimmy Page touches so i have to ask myself why? Why was Stairway the Most Heard Song of it's time? Why does it tell us that "he will give you 666"?? Don't be a shallow putz and write me off without examining this thoroughly yourself before responding from your heart. The fodder i have seen over the years regarding people's opinions of Stairway, Zep, and backwards messages have led me to believe that Many will take the chip as planned. Next week's children will be getting them directly thru their dr.s via nano-tech shots to prevent H1N1 etc., etc. OK, I've pointed you in the right direction..maybe do a little further investigation on your own, take care, fear only fear itself, and be good to each other, enjoy thy journey!<br>I'm off for some chocolate chunk..</span>

Isn't the may queen a term he used in one of his poems? Oh so Robert Plant didn't feel possessed.</span>

Through the years when radio stations play their year end songs of all time, this one is always in the top two....even if the lists change from year to year, this song always endures at least the runner up position if not in the number one slot...thank you!</span>

         <span class="commentext">Although several other Zeppelin songs draw their inspiration more directly from Lord of the Rings, I believe there is at least one line in Stairway that draws from that work.<br><br>Specifically, I believe the line, "There's a feeling I get, when I look to the west, and my spirit is crying for leaving," refers to the Elves. As I recall, they all have some level of desire to travel over the sea to the lands in the west, leaving behind middle earth. <br><br>I'm sure plenty of people have noticed this, but I seldom see Lord of the Rings referenced when it comes to this song.<br><br>I remember well a period of about 20 years, from the mid 70's to the mid 80's when this was easily the most played song on FM radio. I never grow tired of hearing it, and in particular, hearing Page's greatest ever solo. The greatest song on what is possibly the greatest-ever album.</span>

         <span class="commentext">People are going to have differnt views. To me this is one of the most beatiful songs ever written. Yea it tells the truth. When someone speaks that they speak one way and think the other,as in a forked toungue. We all look between the lines for a hidden meaning. I think the song does represent a lady that struggles for just that, and the man has the answer he thinks! But she will climb higher to get to where she belongs,in a stairway to heaven, to escape the boundaries that were set on her by her master. Whether it be a man or a spirtual entity! Sometimes she cannot trust either,but the wisdom she may find in herself,yet they may try to seek.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Ok, why would they make a "satanic" song backwards that had such a pure and good message forward for everyone to hear?? If it would be true it would only make the song even more brilliant.. "sometimes words have two meanings" it's a song about the choice between good and evil, and the song would in this way have both sides.. Everyone should make up their own mind, but even if this was true, i wouldn't see it as a tribute to satan rather then just a song with satan incorporated in it..<br>GREATEST SONG OF ALL TIMES ALL CATEGORIES, it has everything, greatest lyric, greatest guitar solo, greatest bassline, so sophisticated how all the different parts go so perfectly together, it has the really quiet calm first, folky part.. it slowly morphs into a smooth rock ballad and climaxes in an awesomely rythmic guitarriff with kickass rock n roll drums with a bit of a military vibe to it.. every part is unique, intelligent and seem so obvious like all good songs do, this time it's without beeing simple..</span>

         <span class="commentext">Led Zeppelin are not satanists. If they were, would they deny it? If Robert Plant was a satanist, why would he get upset that people are saying Stairway To Heaven has satanic messages? Wouldn't he be more flattered? Why would he dismiss being a satanist if he really was? The fact that he says he is not a satanist means he is not. They wouldn't lie about that. Plus, I have that Stairway To Heaven was inspired by The Lord of the Rings, and I have heard this more than the "satanic message" thing. By the way, Stairway to Heaven is a beautiful and great song, inspiring and epic.</span>

         <span class="commentext">To Billy in Nederland Texas. Christian song? stairway to Heaven? I don't think so. The Piper is from Pagan beliefs such as Pan for example. The May queen is from May Day celebration which is a fertility festival. As for the verse about rings of smoke thru the trees, to me it is still pagan and/or wiccan references. Being of wiccan belief, I find a lot of wiccan references in the song. It was one of the MOST evil thought of songs when it first came out. It was believed to have satanic messages in it....lol, lol how funny. The song is fantastic. I have loved this song since I was a teenager...oooh, this is painful but that has been a long time ago.

         <span class="commentext">In my opinion, Led Zeppelin is the greatest rock band to have ever graced the earth with their presense. They have influenced countless bands, and inspired people to get into music. I myself first got into Rock from the 60's and 70's because of Led Zeppelin. Their music contained a passions that you just don't get from todays version of Rock except from a few exceptions (such as the Foo Fighters, Tool and others like them.). Now for this song itself, being a HUGE Led Zeppelin fan, i can tell you that this is definantly one of the greatest rock songs of all time, however, it is not Led Zeppelin's greatest song, nor is it THE greatest song of all time. Stairway to Heaven is one of those songs that everyone knows and is THAT song that people know the band for, like Rob Zombie's Dragula, or The Eagle's Hotel California. While the solo in this song is very good, those in "Since I've Been Loving You" and the live 18 minute version of "Dazed and Confused" are much better. I suggest any new Led Zeppelin fan checks out these songs and hopefully delves deeper into the magic that is Led Zeppelin's Discography</span>

You can only hear it if you have lyrics in front of you, and you can also hear the 'messages' if you sing it YOURSELF and play it backwards with lyrics. And Jimmy Page was not a satanist, he might have just owned his house and read some of his books... but he never joined the satanist church. And now he has separated himself from all that stuff.</span>

The unnamed album, little eerie don't you think and yes I never noticed, Stairway is number 13. And yes he bought Mr.Cowley's house, and he was involved in black magic and he was interested in that kind of stuff. Never-the-less, they are, will be, and ever have been the greatest rock band eva and that will remain the greatest song ever, no matter what you say. I agree though, I, personally, went through a phase for a week and a half of being obsessed with backmasking... LISTEN TO THE MUSIC FOR WHAT IT IS MAN!!!!!!!!!!

         <span class="commentext">First of all, I am a HUGE zep fan. Many people do not know what to think because it may be a coincedence, it may not be. Personally, I am one of those people. I question what people say about there not being satanic messages, I don't know where to go because there are so many references back to the subject in the controversial 5th verse that it can't possibly be a coinsodence. I do though think that Page was a satanist but kept it from the public. What about the mysterious "unamed album" that the track first appeared on, that the show a very odd photo of an old man on the front, or did anyone referback to the current days, what about when they produced Mothership, the song was unlucky number 13. Definately, satanic message or no, the song was made to cause some hype about history's greatest rock band.</span>

The musical background is beautiful with the sound of the guitar and the other instruments. It's one of the best song I have heard. In my opinion, the lyrics are also beautiful, with words like Heaven, stairway, May Queen, rings of smoke, piper, 2 meanings, thoughts are misgiven. There are challenging lyrics for me. Whether it is good or bad song, I feel the challenge to love it more than to hate it; to love the composer rather than to hate him. I firmly believe that love is more powerful than hatred. Who am I to judge my Bro. Jimmy Page or other members of the Led Zeppelin? Some of the greatest saints were actually sinners before they became saints.

         <span class="commentext">For everyone talking about the Satanic message thing, it has been pointed out on numerous occasions that the word "there" sounds a lot like "satan" when played backward. If you look at the "hedgerow" verse played backward, "there" and "satan" line up perfectly together. This trend could also be seen in other classic rock songs such as the Doors' Break on Through or the Eagles' Hotel California. <br><br>Moral of the story: There = Satan! It's a coincidence.

         <span class="commentext">Guys, let the whole "backwards messages" go. If anyone can explain to me HOW exactly they would make it so that if you played fully understandable lyrics backwards and get a satanic message, or WHY they would do that, then I might believe that its in the song. But even if it IS in the song, why would that matter at all? Backwards messages don't work subconsciously, because you can't hear them conciously. So even if they did exist, which they DONT, (yes, i've heard it myself, you can't tell what they're saying if you dont have the words infront of you) then it shouldn't matter. Just listen to the damn song and enjoy it's brilliance, don't ponder about what it means if you play your record backwards. And as "me, why should I tell u?" said, Jimmy Page wasn't Satanic, he just studied the occult.</span>

Its no different then the production done for later Beatles like Abby Road. Page is a satanist which IS a religion like it or not and he produced all of Zeps albums sooooo, blame him. Robert is a spiritualist studying and practicing many religions, he wouldnt have any part of that but it wasnt his choice and so I think he just stays in denial.<br>By the way this song is about our journey through life. One of the philisophical "paths" is the accumulation of worldy goods but it doesnt say that is a bad thing. The references to JRR TOLKEIN are there because Plant loved this author and of course words like bustle, hedgerow and may queen are English which, wow-wee so are the bsand members! Its a lovely etherial mix of fantasy and philosophy..too much attention to satanic refrences that the youth focus on when they listen to this song.

Simplicity can work, if it's meant to be that way. Take Hey There, Delilah. Yes, I'm sorry to be comparing Plain White T's to Led Zeppelin. However, it is important to note that that song is also very simple, in fact more so, because it has basically a guitar and that's it (well, for most of the song) with three chords. Does that make it a bad song? No.<br>Plus, is the whole solo in the middle of Stairway simple? It doesn't sound like it thank you very much.

And with no STH single, it took about nine months for the hard partying rock &amp; rollers to stay awake all the way through the album and get to know Stairway To Heaven.<br>I've learned to play this song, revised my style to fit better as time has gone by, memorized the lyrics and played this at a North Georgia Christmas party whilst drunk rock &amp; roll rednecks on one side telling me if I screwed up they'd kick my ass, and a born-again Christian couple(wonderful folks though) on the other side telling me the song worshipped Satan(he was called Lucifer in the beginning), at the same time...now that was fun!<br>I joined their church, and played Dobro in the church orchestra later on.<br>I never get tired of Jimmy Page on his trusty D-18 Martin Guitar intro, and the totally amped Les Paul solo at the break. The only performing artist to ever come close to covering this song, was Frank Zappa.<br>I know there is probably one opinion of what this song means for every person who ever heard it.

         <span class="commentext">i tried to discover the truth to the so-called "satan messages" myself. i played the song backwards to 10 people who i TOLD what the alleged satanistic lyrics were. and all of them but 1 claimed to hear the satan message. then i played it backwards to 10 people who i DIDNT tell what the satanistic lyrics were and ALL of them said they heard nothing but wierd sounds and nonsense. which doesnt prove but provides good evidence to what we already know is true!!!<br><br>LED ZEPPELIN IS NOT WORKING FOR THE DEVIL and people only hear these messages because they are focused on hearing them</span>

         <span class="commentext">you would think that if it did have a message backwards, they would admitt it. it makes no sence to go through all the work to put it there just to deny it. its not like they kept any of their other religious belifs and stuff secret. i guess you could say they wanted people to figure it out on their own, but still they did deny it. and no offence or anything but how did 'jimmy' have time to type that whole thing! gosh it took me ten minuites to READ it! :)</span>

         <span class="commentext">This song has always been one of my favorites; Although, it is has been the center of many controvercial debates. Most of the arguments about Stairway have been over what exactly the song is about or what exactly is the message that Zeppelin is trying to send through. Well, I think this is one of those songs that take different meanings for different people. If you listen to the song very closely, you can understand how the song can be about a woman commiting suicide. I beleive that the message Zeppelin was trying to get through was that a woman comes into a lot of money, but doesn't find out until it's too late that money cannot buy everything and definately cannot buy her into heaven. But again I think that this song can take on several different meanings, depending on how you want to, for lack of a better word, DECODE the lyrics. But that is my opinion and I am not trying to force my ideas on anyone, i just thought i would throw that out as a theory for everyone to ponder for a while.</span>

         <span class="commentext">First I want to make it clear...<br><br>I am not a religious person, I do not attend church, nor do I have a bible I thump.<br>I do not believe in the personification of a deity called "Satan". So I do not have a religious agenda to push. My interest in Pages satanic backwards messages in Stairway to Heaven, is purely from a desire to expose the truth.<br><br>Whether Page believes in satan, or worships this fictional deity, I do not know,<br>nor do I really care. What I am more interested in is the elaborate deception.<br><br>Some have suggested that the phrases found in this song, when played backward, are<br>coincidence, or things people wish to hear. I reject this hypothesis because, though<br>it might have been easy to dismiss one or two such bits, when collected together,<br>they stay within a consistent theme. One of these phrases consists of eight words<br>that form a coherent sentence that fits this theme. The bits are:<br><br>1) My sweet satan<br><br>2) The one whose little path would make me sad, whose power is Satan.<br><br>3) He will give those with him 666.<br><br>4) There was a little tool shed where he made us suffer, sad Satan.<br><br>5) We shall all fall if we lose feathers<br><br>Statistically speaking, there is no way that the word satan could appear so many<br>times in one song by accident. Statistically speaking, having phrases that are coherent,<br>consisting of 8-13 words backwards, by accident, is impossible... period. The fact<br>that they all are also part of a coherent theme, makes it undeniably intentional.<br><br>Now Page had already pioneered backwards masking, a technique where you physically<br>cut the tape and re-insert it flipped backwards. So he was more than familiar with<br>the concept. <br><br>But here is the deal... when you flip something backwards it is easily picked up by<br>our ears/brain as being backwards. Example, the backwards clip on Pink Floyd's "The<br>Wall", which mentions a contest to enter if you find the secret backwards message.<br><br>Page and Plant have denied that there is backward masking on Stairway, and they <br>are telling the truth. The messages were not placed there using backwards masking,<br>that would have been obvious and easy to recognize. The technique Page used was <br>far more creative and devious. First Page played around with phrases he wanted to<br>include, recorded them forwards, then played them backwards to hear what they sounded<br>most like. After determining what words worked both forwards and backwards, he reconstructed<br>the sentences to be dual purpose. Hence, there is no backwards masking.<br><br>Having edited sound professionally for over 20 years, I have done experiments to prove this method, it's not hard to do.<br><br>Further more, Page wanted people to look for these messages, and included instructions,<br>in the forward lyrics.<br> <br>"There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure, because you know<br>sometimes words have two meanings."<br><br>This is a clear declaration that the words have two meanings.<br><br>The song itself, which is very melancholy, is about making the choice between good<br>and evil, <br><br>"Yes there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run, there's still<br>time to change the road your on."<br><br>And in the climactic finale, the lyrics reveal their chosen path:<br><br>"And as we wind on down the road, our shadows taller than our souls.."<br><br>Suggesting that their sinful deeds have eclipsed their souls.<br><br>Again, I have no religious agenda, I do not believe in satan. <br><br>Personally, I believe that these messages were placed in the song to create hype<br>and controversy, which is exactly what they did. Page made a concerted effort, from<br>the design of the album, including references to the occult and astrology/tarot,<br>and the enigmatic symbols representing the band members, to the careful crafting<br>of the song Stairway including it's double meanings, to create something mysterious<br>and magical. Something that would stir emotion and imagination for generations.<br><br>A quote from Page: "Every musician wants to do something of lasting quality, something<br>which will hold up for a long time and I guess we did it with "Stairway".<br><br>Clearly Page put more thought and engineering into Stairway, than any other song.<br><br>I think Page succeeded in his goal, but I think it is important that people have<br>the opportunity to see the truth as well. <br><br>Some facts to consider:<br><br>1) Jimmy Page owned an occult bookstore in England. Where he sold Crowley's books.<br><br>2) Page was a devote follower of Alistair Crowley.<br><br>3) Page purchased and lived in the Boleskin house, Crowley's former residence.<br><br>4) The scene in Song Remains the Same, where Jimmy Page (With glowing red eyes) <br>is sitting and cranking out music on a tiny music box, was shot behind the Boleskin<br>house.<br><br>Any one item by themselves, may seem ridiculous, but when they are all brought together,<br>the pattern is undeniable. Whether because Page actually believes in satan, or whether<br>it was all an elaborate hoax, the intent was genuine and carefully calculated.<br><br>It has also been suggested that listeners hear what they are prompted to hear. While<br>this theory may hold some truth, after all, the power of suggestion can be strong.<br>When I first spun my old vinyl album backwards, the only phrase that had been suggested<br>to me at the time, was the "My sweet satan". The rest was just obvious to my ears,<br>and I think it is no coincidence that it syncs with the overall general consensus<br>of the backwards messages. <br><br>Today bands that want to include satanic themes into their music, do it directly,<br>in-your-face. But back then, in 1971, it was still too controversial to take the<br>direct approach. In my humble opinion, adding mystique to a body of work, is usually<br>a great thing, it adds more dimension to the work and makes the audience bring their<br>own imagination into the mix. Many bands of the day did it, some more successfully<br>than others.<br><br>What I object to is the deception and the lies.<br><br>In a clip presented here, a DJ takes a caller, who asks Page about the Crowley home<br>rumors. However, the caller makes two mistakes, he refers to Crowley's Castle in<br>England. Page dodges this question adeptly, as it is incorrect, he answers that <br>Crowley never had one, and he never lived in one. This is true, because the Boleskin<br>House, though it may have been a "Castle" to Crowley, was not a proper castle in<br>any sense of the word, and it was located in Scotland, not England.<br><br>But what is more interesting is that Page didn't point this out. He was content <br>to dodge the question and make the caller look like a fool. What does Page have <br>to hide? If he is not a follower of the occult, so obsessed with Crowley that he<br>had to buy and live in the house he owned... then why not admit to the truth?<br><br>I still listen to Led Zeppelin, but when I listen to Stairway, I keep in mind that<br>"..you know sometimes words have two meanings."</span>

         <span class="commentext">There are a thousand meanings to this song and they can be all correct interpretations because it is mystical in nature, it is not a math problem that has only one correct answer. Here is one of many different interpretations. <br><br>Remember, a song is a poem put to music. "It is the immediate influence of the Holy Spirit that causes words such as these to stream from the tongue of the poets, the significance of which they themselves are oftentimes unable to apprehend." "Dawn Breakers" Nabil's Narrative pg 258 <br><br>Remember, a song is a poem put to music. First, let's look at the concepts that run through the song. <br><br>"With a word..."<br>"... sometimes words..."<br>"... there is a sign..."<br>"... who sings..."<br>"... spirit is crying..."<br>"... my thoughts ..."<br>"... voices of those..."<br>"... it's whispered..."<br>"... can you hear..."<br>"...did you know"<br><br>The holy books of the world tell us these same things. In America we are most familiar with the Bible which speaks about the "word" of God. The Bible says, be on guard, watch, look, listen, ye now not the hour. Sounds like; words, signs, sings, thoughts, voices, whispered, hear, know.<br><br>Also note this imagery<br><br>"... the piper..."<br>"... new day ..."<br>"... laughter ..."<br>"... clean ..."<br>"... change ..."<br>"... calling you ..."<br>"... can you hear ..."<br>"... did you know ..."<br><br>Calls to mind references to the holy books in the world. The Promised One ( the piper ) who will come to unite the world, the kingdom of God on earth, the New Jerusalem. A new day that will not be followed by night, etc... <br><br>Now let's take it verse by verse<br><br>First verse: Wealthy women in the West that expend their wealth to help spread the devine teachings of the Promised One. Despite their wealth they did not let it come between them and their creator. They know the word, the "new name", so will you also learn it. Upon him that overcometh I will write upon him a "new name". <br><br>Second verse: The religious leaders of the world claim to know, yet every time a Prophet comes to the world they are the first to persecute him. Yet illiterate fishermen accept him and so it is in this day. This is the double standard, the two meanings. Listen with your heart not your head.<br><br>Third verse, this dispensation is being spread from the West not from the East. So powerful of this revelation your soul yearns for it, even as this song speaks to our souls. The world has never seen a day like this day. We went from horse and carraige to man on the moon in one life time. Something extraordinary has happened to the world.<br><br>Fourth verse, the tune that whispers of the oneness of humanity, of religion and of God. Then will the world enter into the Great Peace promised to us in the worlds holy books.<br><br>Fifth verse, don't be alarmed at all the trouble the world is going through, the wars and rumor of wars, neither desease or famine because it it the birth pangs of world peace to come. Work for building the new world order, the old world order will be crushed by it's own weight.<br><br>Sixth verse, we will not find tranquility until we find the Promised One who is calling us. We will find him in the most subtle of places. <br><br>Seventh verse, as we go down the road of life towards our death we cast a shadow of our deeds and actions that will effect our soul in the spirit world. "The Lady", not the burning bush, not the dove, not the angel Gabriel, "The Lady" standing on a pillar of light. She will guide us to the Promised one. We will recognize the tune, like the flock will recognize the voice of the devine shepard. World Peace. <br><br>This is my first and final comment on the song. If you like it then I wish you well on your spiritual journey. If you purify your spirit and strive with all your might then you will be led to that "sacred snow white spot".<br><br>If you do not like this commentary then I apologize for wasting your time.</span>

Zep, in my opinion, is the greatest band ever by far. Page clearly was into black magic, crowley, creepy thing, ect. But, he was, in my opinion, the greatest guitarist ever by far. The song itself I do not believe to be satanic. Double check this if u wish but many english words played backwards do sound lie satan. The rest our minds can fill in. The only problem I have with the song is it's WAYYY overplayed. I think some people believe Zep to be 1 hit wonders because this is all they hear. Zep will never be appreciated for all their great hits because they hide behind this one. I personally love every song they made i know most by heart and I'd love for everyone else to be able to do the same. Thank you for reading</span>

         <span class="commentext">My two cents. When I was about 12 a friend of mine had a record player that had a neutral speed, allowing one to spin the record backwards. So we gave it a try. I remember making out "satan" pretty clearly several times. As I recall, right where the line "and there's still time to change the road you're on," is a backwards line of, "We sing for Satan." <br>It sounds more dubbed in than an actual backwards sound of the forward lyric, but I have no idea.<br>I'm not sure what any of this means, I am just saying that it is there and not just, "people hearing things," or "hearing what they want to hear."<br>My record player had no way of playing records backward.<br>If they did it to get people talking about their song for years to come it succeeeded but, as it turns out, the song was plenty good to be appreciated for years anyway.</span>

In the background between actual songs you can hare Page playing the intro to Stairway, not exactly as it was recorded 10 years later, but is was Stairway, no question about it.

         <span class="commentext">Actually according to Christian demonology there are loads and loads of demon or devil references in Stairway to Heaven. Christians don't like pagans, right? So they steal their holidays and make up stuff about their beliefs. Personally I don't like paganism or christianity but onto the subject.<br><br> The piper: Could be interpreted as the pied piper, the old german tale of the man hired by a town to remove rats with a magical flute and when the town doesn't pay him, he uses the flute on the children! The people end up believing he is the devil and all that etc.<br><br> Okay, now another road of thought on the piper: Greek mythology. You have Pan, a flute playing GOATMAN. Pan also appears in pagan beliefs (not as Pan but generally goat people are in paganism). Now christians don't really like goatmen right? Because they're all pagan and evil so guess what? They get an old pagan symbol and draw and goat man head in it! Ta da! A christian pentagram representing their devil and a lot of angry pagans.<br><br> So that's how satanic the song is but there are also drug references which would piss off prissy christian family groups as well!<br><br> I believe this song is about a journey to enlightenment (Even if that journey involves illegal substances), ever seen the artwork? Old man at the top of the ledge above a town? What is he carrying with him? A lantern and what is in that lantern? The STAR OF DAVID! And where is that star from? Jews! And what do Jews like? Jews like knowledge, they like lots of knowledge and wisdom so they can make up for pissing off God too much. There you go knowledge and enLIGHTenment.<br><br> Oh and one thing I forgot to add, the bright light also refers to Lucifer if you're like really, really clever or watch supernatural, so you know another christian teeth sinker.</span>

         <span class="commentext">You know the old saying, "you only hear what you want to hear." This is why, with all the ambiguity in the lyrics, you can have one group of christians say the song is satanic and another say its an evangelical song. Both are ridiculous. Robert Plant was no christian, so why would he write his defining lyric about jesus? And there are no references to satan in the lyrics either. I'm sure you could pick a d.c. talk song or any song by some lame christian group at random and play their music backwards and find subliminal messages about satan. Its all just random garbage that sometimes sounds like something. The fact of the matter is, the song isn't really about any one thing. You would have to be Robert Plant at the moment he wrote it to really know what its about. Most of the lyrics are really just vague lines that go together well. The lyrics were mostly an exercise in stream of conscience writing, as he pretty much just wrote the first thing to pop in his head. Thats why 'sometimes words have two meanings', as there have been many guesses as to what the song is about. There are a lot of what could certainly be references to Lady Galadriel, and this makes sense because Plant was a big fan of Lord of the Rings and referenced the books in a few other songs as well. In that case, the 'heaven' he is referring to is Valinor where the undying souls reside in the Tolkein tale. It doesn't hurt that this 'heaven' is west ('there's a feeling I get/when I look to the west/and my spirit is crying for leaving') of the Misty Mountains (another song from the same album, Misty Mountain Hop). Also, the May Queen is a mythological reference to the queen of the elves. May Queen was also the name of a poem by Aleister Crowley. It is a quite common misconception that Crowley was a satanist, when he was nothing of the sort. Christians like to say religious beliefs that are 'weird' or occult must therefore be satanic, and that's just wrong. Not to cause any alarm with that reference, yes the members of Led Zeppelin were interested in the occult, but that doesn't make them satanists. I'm interested in reading about such things, and I don't even believe satan exists. I'm also interested in the history of christianity and where the writers of the bible found their influences in other religions, and I don't believe jesus exists other than as a man who was the David Koresh of his time. Its just interesting to read about. And if you take all song lyrics literally, listen to 'hey, hey what can I do' where Plant sings about going to church on Sunday and there's plenty of singing about jesus in 'in my time of dying'. There, he's a satanist and a christian.</span>

         <span class="commentext">This is no doubt one of the best songs in the history of time. Both Beautiful (Because of sound) and Chaotic (because of the idiots out there who CREATE the chaos by assigning means and political and religious stand points to the song) Just because someone backmasks does not make them Satanic. My english teacher trys talking backwards all the time, and he's a pastor at a local church (Not a satanic one either.) I've listened to it backwards, and while, theoretically you can hear satanic messages, they are garbled. The whole reason one hears satanic messages is because some stupid Disc Jockey found the right formula of speed and rotation to apply in order to make them clearer. We have been told the messages are satanic, so we expect to hear satanic messages, and therefore we do hear satanic messages. If you were skilled enough you could make them sound like they were talking about anything, satanism was conveniant though because Page had an occult bookstore, even though he has long since sold it and denyed any affiliation with Satanism. For Goodness sakes people he gives money to charity! He trys to make the world a better place. So to all you people out there who are too fixated on Religious conspiracys and trying to destroy everything that true rockers hold dear, get a life, and follow God like God wants to be followed, through love, not hate and conspiracy theorys.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Wow, I think that was the longest thread I've ever read. For my two cents on this one, "Seek and ye shall find," - whether you are seeking God, Satan, LOTR, Celtic Mythology, Janis Joplin or production company hypocracy. I always keep in mind the fact that my interpretation is all about me and usually has very little to do with the author's original intent - especially if he/she is good at their job. Ambiguity is the hallmark of great art because it leaves the listener/viewer able to place their own perspective on the subject, while still sharing common human experiences of beauty, wonder, pain, etc.,(that's why we're all still talking about the Mona Lisa's smile centuries later - she's sure got much better looking competition in recorded artistic history, and yet she is the most famous). Based on the impassioned, widely varied responses in this thread, I would say the guys have done top notch work - musically and lyrically. Personally, I thank God I got to be born into a world where not only were JRR Tolkein and Led Zep possible to experience at the same time, I got to do so while drinking homemade elderberry wine ;-)</span>

         <span class="commentext">Wow! I read all the comments and what a diverse interpretation of the music there is! I did go to the backmasking web-site, that is referred to in some of the posts, and listened to "Stairway to Heaven" played backwards and IT IS eerie! I was always kind of freaked out to hear certain songs played backward. I know when I first graduated from high school, and got my first job back in 1977, there was a radio station in Atlanta that was looking back at the "Paul is Dead" Beatle's controversy, and the way that you could play backwards certain Beatle's songs and hear a message saying "Paul is Dead" and other strange and eerie statements. I guess the Beatle's did it for a publicity stunt or something, but it sure sounded scary and it is also on that same web-site. I wanted to add to the discussion by saying that in Cameron Crowe's wonderful movie "Almost Famous," Stairway to Heaven plays a wonderful role, but in a deleted scene no less. If you have a copy of the DVD, you might have seen this scene. When the teenage boy (the main subject of the film) gets offered a writing job with Rolling Stone magazine, his mother is totally against it because he is only 15, is an honor student, and she is way over-protective. He brings one of his high school teachers, his counselor, and his sister's boyfriend to try and convince his mother to let him go out and write a piece on Led Zepplin for the magazine. She refuses at first, but then he plays Stairway To Heaven for her, and she finally gives him permission to go, but with a set of rules attached. It is very funny, and although the song was not "cleared" by Led Zepplin for use in the film, Cameron Crowe did an interesting thing by stopping the film at the point where YOU the VIEWER should go and get your copy (album - vinyl - is preferable, but CD will do) and he tells you when to start it up. Then the movie continues with a very funny scene of this boy, his support group, and his mother listening to Stairway to Heaven. In the boy's introduction to the song, he tells his Mother that Stairway to Heaven was inspired by and is about J.J. Tolkeins "Lord of the Rings," which, he tells her, is a literary masterpiece and a very inspirational book. I don't know if that is actually so or not, but in the SONG FACTS at the top of the page, one person does say that it IS about Lord of the Rings. I would like to think that is so! The boy goes on to say that the Lady in the song is actually the Elf Queen (who was played in the Lord of the Rings by Cate Blanchett). Anyway, I loved the movie "Almost Famous," and I recommend it to anyone with a genuine love of movies, and of 70's music. This song is a classic, and has always been a favorite of mine. It bring back my high school years definitely, and what a lovely and heady time that was!</span>

         <span class="commentext">This is my second-favorite song of all time (nothing beats Bohemian Rhapsody). There's something strange about it. It's both simple and complex, short and long, plain and elegant, sad and happy. Though, I don't think this song ever ought to be analyzed too deeply. I did that with Bohemian Rhapsody and almost ruined it for myself. Therefore, I don't try to understand what the words are about. All I know is that there's a journey, and a piper, and a lady who tries to buy a stairway to heaven but can't. Other than that, I must admit that I can't tell what else the song is about. I don't want to know. If there's a hidden meaning behind it, then I don't care. I have heard this song backwards, but it didn't do much for me. I doubt they really meant it that way. Oddly enough, my friends all assosiate me with this song because I did it three times for talent shows. It's incredible. Led Zeppelin is amazing. Favorite Zeppelin song ever.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Okay, Here's a message for Lisa Denison. Aleister<br>Crawley wrote "The Book of the Law". A lot of his book is used in the Satanists' bible. Now YOU CANNOT tell me that that man wasn't demon possessed. And as far as Led Zeppelin, AC-DC, Brittany Spears, Jay Z, Snoop Dogg, N-SYNC, Madonna, THE BEATLES!!!, etc., goes, they all backmask, and they all follow Aleister Crawley, who is without a doubt Satanist. See, I've done it myself with 2 computers and their music, and let me tell ya, as scary as it is, it's true. Ya'll are all in denial because it's too difficult for you to accept the fact that you're wrong, and you don't want to give up your music. The music that you're listening to though, is actually controlling you. Music can be used as a drug because it releases endorphines in your brain that causes you to get high. That's why you crave music. For example, that's why listening to fast music pumps you up or why listening to slow music relaxes you. You all need a reality check and realize that there are people who'd do things like backmasking. THEY'RE SATANISTS! THEY DO IT ON PURPOSE! Jimmy Page, if I'm not mistaken, admitted that when he got on-stage that there was a demonic force controlling and pushing him. I have a 3 CD collection of a man named Nathan Barrett who taught me all of this. He actually did the backmasking himself and researched many different artists. Some of them confessed in magazines. And Jay Dundalk, Christians don't cuss.</span>

         <span class="commentext">For those who don't think Page is a Satanist here a fact for you. Page currently lives in a house that was owned by Alister Crowley who "By now Crowley was fast becoming infamous as a Black magician and Satanist, he openly identified himself with the number 666, the biblical number for the antichrist." Also here's a link to Jeff Milner's site on that has a great reveal of the prayer to Satan back masked in the "If there's a bustle in your hedgerow" verse.

         <span class="commentext">In the verse when the drums come into play "yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run, there's still time to change the road your on" is where the back masking is. You hear "here's to my sweet satin" and satin again is said. Just convert the song to wav, use windows sound recorder and clip that verse of the song. Then click the reverse tab under effects and you hear it. <br><br>Weather this was meant to be put there or not it is clearly there. It probably means nothing and I could care less if it does but some people find it interesting. It really adds to the mystique of the song thats for sure. <br><br>Jason, Sunrise, Fl</span>

         <span class="commentext">ok this is my personal opinion and plz dont give me crap about it.. i belive that this song is about the apocalpse (i know i spelled that wrong). the reason why is because of certain parts of the song. such as when he says "may queen" the virgin mary is also known as the queen of may and if u read the book of revalations it says that there is a woman and has a child born. this is probably mary. another part is how plant says theres two paths and u can change which one ur on doesnt have to be between god and satan it could just mean being a hardcore chirstian or catholic or being a sinner. it is in the bible that god will always forgive us. make sense? for the piper that could be anything there are tons of ppl that could resemble the piper. it could be a prophet that is saying wats gonna happen. also the part when it says the forest well echo with laughter could be ppl happy with jesus christ coming to earth and joining everlasting life in heaven. now im not a religious fanatic or some priest ok im just someone who has an open mind for things. for the messages relax guys cause if satan wanted anything it wouldnt be a song. another thing why do u ppl have conspicies about songs. music is about expressing ur self. i think thats enough said.</span>

Christian fundamentalists didn't know what the meaning of the song was at all. Their objection was that it was a very popular rock song and that is it. The reason they play things backwards is because some dope decided this is how Satan is "corrupting the youth" through rock music and the rest followed.

If you think this has secret meanings... try to cope well my friends but I don't think Page or Plant or anyone would waste time doing this. Many songs if you play them backwards would say something but what doesn't? Try recording conversations (wouldn't advise it) and listen to them backwards... All in all it's what you believe. Don't waste your time thinking such things thoughts. They're a great band. Don't disrespect and throw away their hard work and dedication. If you are still very superstitious think of it this way.

         <span class="commentext">If you feel you want a true meaning for this song this is it.<br><br>Stairway To Heaven <br>words and music by Robert Plant, Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin. <br><br>There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold <br>And she's buying a stairway to heaven. (she is tithing) <br>When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed <br>With a word she can get what she came for. (The bible is the word of God, with the bible, she can get into Heaven.) Revelation 3:8 <br>Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven. (She is tithing and she she thinks that will get her into Heaven) <br><br>There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure (points out the significance of the next line, hint hint) <br>'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. (parables, which the bible is full of, and the words in this song have two meanings) <br>In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, (reference to John the Baptist and Jesus) <br>Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving. <br>Ooh, it makes me wonder, (think!) <br>Ooh, it makes me wonder. <br><br>There's a feeling I get when I look to the west, (the anointing of the holy spirit's comforting, Christianity is the religion of western civilization) (it's usually about now that I feel the spirit! -jk) <br>And my spirit is crying for leaving. (soul crying out to be saved) <br>In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees, (Revelation of Jesus Christ) <br>And the voices of those who standing looking. <br>Ooh, it makes me wonder, <br>Ooh, it really makes me wonder. <br><br>And it's whispered (Revealed by Jesus) that soon if we all call the tune <br>Then the piper (Jesus, the one playing the woodwind instrument, the flute, which has a whispering tone) will lead us to reason. (Jesus' second coming, revelation 7:17) <br>And a new day will dawn for those who stand long (World after tribulation) Revelation 3:12 <br>And the forests will echo with laughter. <br><br>Well I've got some good news! (Gospel is the Greek word for good news) <br>If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, <br>It's just a spring clean for the May queen. (God puling the weeds, the tare, reaping...) <br>Yes, there are two paths you can go by (the Stairway to Heaven or the Highway to Hell), but in the long run, <br>There's still time to change the road you're on. <br>Well I hope so! (There is always hope. It is never to late to be saved) <br>And it makes me wonder. <br><br>Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know, <br>The piper's calling you to join him, (Jesus said I will knock on the door...) Rev 3:20 <br>Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, (the word of Jesus) and did you know <br>Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. (if you want to get to heaven you have to follow the piper, Jesus. Christians are saved by grace, not by their works.) <br><br>And as we wind on down the road (Later in life, after a few wrong turns. There is a straight and narrow path to heaven, there is a long and winding road to hell. ) <br>Our shadows taller than our soul. (late in the day (near the end of our life) we cast longer shadows, our soul is nothing with out Jesus) <br>There walks a lady we all know <br>Who shines white light and wants to show <br>How everything still turns to gold. (Later in life after more and more sin we can still be saved. The new world after the tribulation will be made of gold.) <br>And if you listen very hard <br>The tune will come to you at last. (if you accept Christ the holy spirit will come into your heart and you will be saved.) <br>When all are one and one is all (in Heaven we are one with God) <br>To be a rock and not to roll. (Jesus is the Rock, be strong with his foundation) <br><br>And she's buying a stairway to heaven................</span>

         <span class="commentext">I agree. Anyone playing songs backwards to find hidden meanings really should put the joint down. Christians who give the rest of us Christians a bad name, started this dumb "search for Satan" decades ago to say rock and roll was infiltrated by the subtleties of Satan. And even today obviously there are people are still doing it. I think the inventor of that was the Church Lady from SNL. Blows my mind. First there was pig-latin, now there's "peyote-latin".</span>

         <span class="commentext">Mickey, you can get a big kick out of my reference to verses in the Bible all you want, but if you read the lyrics and know the Bible, there is clearly more than just a connection. If you can't see them, then you're blind. Are the references to verses necessary? We're talking about the meaning, are we not? Anyone who thinks this song has to be played backwards to understand the meaning really should find something else to do with their time. No one can purposely sing a song to have something understood when playing backwards. Record yourselves talking, play it backwards and let your peyote-induced thoughts hear what you want to hear. "Whoa dude, it sounded like I said 'birds in Waziristan'! What does that mean, maaan?"</span>

         <span class="commentext">Here's my 2 cents on the backmasking. In the book "Hammer of the Gods", they admit to doing it, I have a Tascam 4-track recorder, you can find one for under $90. But on the lyrics "There's still time to change the road you're on." You have to record it on a new tape, flip the tape over at those lyrics and hit play after rewinding. I could make out " Here's to my sweet Satan mmmmmmm Satan." You can hear Robert go nyaaa before the line.I think it was Jimmy Page's way of keeping people arguing about stupid s--t forever. What a genius! Some interpretations made my brain hurt!</span>

         <span class="commentext">Tom, I think your interpretation is too allegorical. Plant does say "rings of smoke through the trees". Pipesmoking isn't going to create that kind of smoke. Plant isn't wanting to leave America for materialism, seriously. His spirit is crying for leaving because of something bad he saw in his thoughts. This is easy. Her buying a stairway to heaven is her doing good deeds and realizing when she dies that she can have anything she wants. Closed stores will be open for her. But doing good deeds for this woman isn't enough, because God is calling her to join him. As it says in the Bible, some people will be called by God. Considering how Plant and Page lived their lives, the last thing Plant would be talking about is materialism. The rock that does not roll is Plant's suggestion that we don't roll. He often said that in his concerts. "Don't you roll!" Being a rock is to be firm and to stand strong. For someone being so allegorical with his interpretation, I can't believe that one got by you so badly. When you overthink, you can turn this song into anything. He clearly made biblical references, just twisted the words with a celtic tone. And I don't want to get into a whole religious debate with you, but Mary isn't the Mother of God. She was the mother of his human flesh only. Jesus put her in her place in the gospels which let her know she was only the mother of his flesh, not spirit. She was a great woman and was chosen for a reason, but she isn't a deity. How did Mary give birth to the Creator of the universe?</span>

         <span class="commentext">Thanks. Isaiah 18 says "Woe to the land shadowing with wings..." From all I've read, and I've read intently, this is the only time America was mentioned. We are shadowing with wings because our national symbol is the Bald Eagle. There are other things in the first few verses that point to that country being the United States. Being this is the only time America is mentioned in the Bible, and 9/11 wasn't mentioned, what will happen must be a lot worse. This is what Plant said he saw in his thoughts.</span>

         <span class="commentext">The greatest songs, like good poetry, contain many meanings which reveal themselves in different ways. That is, in essence, the purpose of art. <br><br>To say that this song is about Janis, LOTR, religion, materialism, or whatever, is correct. To me, the most obvious meaning is that of a cautionary message to America. Jack in Mesa came close to this interpretation as well. As I read the lyrics today, I find them to be more chillingly relevant than ever.</span>

         <span class="commentext">To all the people who say that this song is some sort of Satanic chant, I have a suggestion for you...all of you kindly retreat to your bomb shelters, listen to some old Gospel recorded in a graveyard in 1923, and watch your recorded reruns of the 700 Club, and stop trashing good music. Chad has it right...you'll only hear the Satanic message if you are told it's there. The other day, my friend told me that in the song "More Human Than Human" by White Zombie, Rob Zombie was really chanting, "Paul Newman, thank you, man", and I listened to the song three times and that's all I would hear. The message doesn't exist unless you think it does. This is one of the definitive classic rock songs (along with "Free Bird" and "Layla.") Just enjoy it on it's own merits, and stop trying to turn it into something it's not.</span>

         <span class="commentext">There's a couple of things you left out of the meaning of Stairway. That woman in the song is being called by the Piper, hence God. The Bible talks about people being called. The time Plant was setting this scene in is right before the fall of America in Isaiah 18 and the Tribulation period spoken of in Revelation. "There's a feeling I get when I look to the West..." is America. In Isaiah 18, the US is the country that raises a sign in the mountains (Mount Rushmore)and beyond the rivers of Ethiopia (Ethiopia was in a different place then... was the farthest western country in Africa) which the whole world will pay attention to. Iraq is the country with the spoiling rivers and will most likely be split into three. Many things Plant said are things like Jesus said. "If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now. It's just a Spring clean for the May Queen" is basically what Jesus said in Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21 when he says "when all these things come to pass, let your heart not be troubled, for they must first come to pass" before his return. The last set of verses in Stairway is Plant saying no matter how bad things may get to hold your ground and do what's right. There's still time to change for the good.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Back in high school in 1975, my guitar teacher transcribed for me a version of STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN which I learned after only 5 months of guitar lessons. I used to play that for people when I would play my guitar for them. I really had a laugh when I saw the movie WAYNE'S WORLD for the first time on TV in 1995 and at the guitar shop there was this giant sign on the wall that said NO STAIRWAY! That gave me a pretty good laugh as I used to check out the better guitars at the guitar store on Saturdays at the mall and see what a better guitar would sound like. I used to play for myself, STAIRWAY, HIDEAWAY or SUNFLOWER SLOW DRAG. But I am not a Led Zepplin fan. I simply wanted to learn that song for myself. It sure beat CARCASSI'S CLASSICAL GUITAR METHOD. But I ain't played since 1980. I am happy to just be a consumer of music!</span>

Let the band rest in peace without defining the song as you have. You are wrong. It's meaning and symbolism comes from the Celtic culture; I only make this comment for you to take with an open mind.

         <span class="commentext">This song is about lucifer the fallen angels and their servants going to Hell for all of eternity and not about a woman, the "lady" is Lucifer. This is reveled at the end of the song.<br>Jimmy Page as well as Robert plant both have a deep knowledge of the symbolisms and meanings the satanic.Jimmy page is still a satanist. Robert and John were best friends growing up and John P was a studio musician jimmy knew.When Jimmy Page wanted to make his band he picked 19 and 18 yr olds named Robert and John.Robert insisting that is home town best friend be the drummer. Jimmy Page then taught them these things being a satanist, older wealthy and a star for his day, and because of the mass delusion resulting form lucifer's deception of impersonating God and substituting its worship ie. drinking blood and eating flesh of the first born child sacrifice on the day of the sun, telling the lie that the human race is to blame for the original sin while in fact it was lucifer and the fallen angels, Robert and John and John P fell in to it too and became quite adept with the <br>symbolic and esoteric meanings of these things.<br><br> And as all satanist know fool you are fool you shall be lucifer goes in hell at the end and has no power but lies and deception and is not God.And only a Fool would serve satan.<br><br> Robert did put LOTR references in some songs but the meaning here is not about LOTR just like in "The Battle Of Evermore" he uses them to weave a mysterious picture into the lyrics.The LOTR's books meanings are a subject in it's self.<br><br> As for listening to it backwards you hardly have to if you know the symbolic meanings.There are some very interesting things that people have discovered but lets look at it forewords.<br> Also there s are wordings and pronunciations that are also said at the same time the lyrics are these are not any type of masking but Roberts own voice and soul. I will point these out* in the real explanation and truthful meaning of "Stairway To Heaven" <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>And There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold and she's buying a stairway to heaven. (lucifer hiding behind a woman like a coward it is ) When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed with a word she can get what she came for. (Heaven is blocked from lucifer/but with lies or words or wind/lucfer can decive) There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure 'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. (The writing is on the wall/prophecy/lucifer impersonates God/meaning of God in your minds eyes/also two meanings for words appears later) In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. (Earth /nature/beauty/times interface/flowing engergy in this dimension/lucifers deception of God resulting in spiritual confusion) Ooh, it makes me wonder, (searching for complete truth/also the deception makes him get lost) There's a feeling I get when I look to the west, and my spirit is crying for leaving. (The sun is the symbol of lucifer as is light lucifer being the angel of light or appearing as the angel of light also know as the light bearer/the sun sets in the west therefore lucifer descends to hell/Roberts soul wants to be free knowing lucifers fate) In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,And the voices of those who stand looking. (seeing/hearing the presence of the fallen angels/watchers/those who are hidden and exist but do not wish to be known) And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune (wind/words/if listen and follow lucifer and repeat its lies) Then the piper will lead us to reason. (lucfer will mislead all having impersonated God and already falsely passed its shame onto the innocent will then try to appear to be a liberator) And a new day will dawn for those who stand long (sun rise/lucifer's false ascension/ aleister crowleys "order of the golden dawn') And the forests will echo with laughter. (the fallen angels lucifer/watchers/laugh at the foolish) If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, It's just a spring clean for the May queen. (if you see the truth lucifer will try and lure you in to a false sense of complacency having impersonated God/May 1st is the most satanic day of the year called grand climax/may queen is a reference to a fertility ritual also where lucifer the coward deceiver hides behind sexuality and women/*note Robert also says Law-man at the same time as alarmed) Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run (good-evil/truth-lies) There's still time to change the road you're on. (free will) Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,(lucifer and the fallen angels are real they exist,there is only one true God is real nothing in world or all of the lies or time will change that) The piper's calling you to join him, (lucifer is springing the trap of the deception having lied and impersonated God now wants to mislead you in the end) Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know your stairway lies on the whispering wind. (lucifer in disguise did you know words sometimes have to meanings and that lies will never get you heaven and all the lies in the world are not worth one word of truth) And as we wind on down the road (time/curving path/the end ) Our shadows taller than our soul. (the sun is setting/lucifer is falling to hell/*Robert also says all shadows stolen then are sold) There walks a lady we all know (the world leaders are satanists) Who shines white light and wants to show (She shines white light because it is not a woman the lady is lucifer the angel of light the light bearer) How everything still turns to gold. (and to the last day lucifer will still be what is is worthless and false) And if you listen very hard The tune will come to you at last.(lucifer is the great deceiver the false god and is going to hell with all of the fallen angels and all those who served it*Robert also says the truth will come to you as lies) When all are one and one is all (the end of time/final judgment ) To be a rock and not to roll. (lucifer the fallen angels and all souls that have served are in hell for all of eternity suffering with out end for all the pain misery and suffering they have caused since Babylon and before. *Robers also says Auwa Rot during the saying of "a rock". And shes buying the stairway to heaven (you can not but the stairway to heaven).</span>

         <span class="commentext">at first this song talks about a girl who thinks her happiness lies in money, and she's convinced that money and material possesion are a path to true happiness. She thinks it will buy her a stairway to heaven. the beggining of he song tells us that many people are trapped in this sort of logic and worse still their whole thinking revolves around it ex. (hm.. im rich but not happy, oh! i know i need more, hm... i got more still not happy, oh! i know, they say you need friends to be happy so ill get some friends, since i'm rich it wont be hard and when i get friends and have met that requirement then ill proceed to get richer and thus feel happier) this is an example of all this persons thoughts being misleading (as is mentioned in the song) they try to seek the other things that people say are necessary for happiness but they do it in the wrong context, in the context of getting richer in this case. then the song goes on about the piper and us calling the tune and basically it talks about finding true happiness and purpose and how we seem to be on the verge of a major shift in consciousness which will allow this.</span>

         <span class="commentext">The great "Stairway To Heaven" debate is getting very very old and boring. Let it die already. The song is immortal and will live on for generations as having THE greatest guitar solo of all time. Period! The lyrics are not unlike many many Robert Plant/Zeppelin lyrics. Unless you are him and can get inside his head, only then MAYBE you'll know what he was thinking. BUT , now in 2007 and with Robert being 59 yrs old, even he probably can't remember what he was thinking. The Beatles had many lyrical mysteries in their music after they moved out of their 'early bubble gummy pop love songs'. That's what drugs will do to ya.</span>

Stairway to Heaven accomplishes this beautifully. You have to accept that songs, and other such works don't follow the logic of A to B to C. Rather, their logic is more like that of dreams. And that's why, if they're really good, they "work," even if they're not "supposed to."<br><br><br>Yes, this is a very spiritual song. It's not a piece of the performer's ego laced with Native American or Buddhist or whatever motifs, as so many songs by Jim Morrison and others were.<br><br><br>For all of you who knock 'Zep' because you think they were Satanists, think of what English poet William Blake said about John Milton, author of "Paradise Lost" and the greatest English-language poet besides Shakespeare and Bob Marley: "He was of the Devil's party without knowing it"</span>

         <span class="commentext">OK...1...It's not CROSLEY, it's Crowley. 2. Crowley wasn't Satanic - as in, he did not worship Satan. He was a self-proclaimed magician, he attempted, and if you believe the hype, possibly succeeded, in conujuring up entities, but he wasn't trying to call demons, he was trying to call angels but he sucked at it. Crowley didn't believe in Satan per se - in fact, for the most part, only Judeo-Christians do, most other religions do not. (not to say he wasn't into some wierd stuff, becuase he was...) 3. Buying Crowley's house doesn't make anyone Satanic anymore than a Buddhist buying a church makes him a Christian....Stop listening to what people TELL you something is and investigate it for yourself. I've never listened to it backwards, so I don't know if it says something or not.

         <span class="commentext">wats up. I think this song is one of the greatest songs ever made and i do believe in the backmasking within the song. How they did it i don know. I ran a program called Audacity and was able to backmask that part of the song and the words i found were very clear. I do think page and plant were satanic , and i forget which one but one of them bought the house of Crosley i think his name was. Crosley was a satan worshipper. Alot of led zeppelins songs show satan in them not only this one. Although sometimes i am confused because this song i think can be taken two ways. The piper in the song could either be the devil or it could be god. The fallen angel which is a symbol of led zeppelin represents Lucifer. Also the knot was used much by Crosley and if you put three of the knots together u can see 666. Also the May Queen was a poem written by Crosley which was also satanic. Dont get me wrong i love this song and led zeppelin and i am also a christian.</span>

Still, if there were a message in the song, it would`n be satanic because if talks about how satan made us feel bad, it is not supporting him. also, it is the greatest song of all times (at least it is to me)and has the greatest guitar solo ever.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Perhaps I might put it more plainly. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Without standing in judgement then of those who search: heaven or hell can be found, either, by any person looking for -either. What leads and informs one's search matters most. <br><br>Those who are looking for back-masking will find it, and sometimes, it is meant to be there. However, the following might leaven this whole discussion:<br><br>Take the time for a, 'trip,' outside of your own headphones and visit a few other places in life as you assess this one. For instance, take my 1997 trip to France, where I purposefully arrived on New Year's Eve. <br><br>Following a $550 dinner in the shadow of 'Le Tour Eiffel', on New Year's Eve, my wife and I shook off the champagne and used our purposefully planned, next, New Year's 'day-off' in France to visit the American Cemetary at Omaha Beach, followed by a round of Bernard Montgomery's British monument nearby. There was something in all of those marble crosses, stars, et. al., in the light of the sun setting over the English Channel, 60MPH gales and with Taps dutifully trumpeted. My perspective grew regrding heaven, hell, sacrifice and defeat of the truly demonic, if you will.<br><br>Follow that by a tour of L' Mussee Dorsay and The Louvre. Now then, having done all of the above, ask yourself about where heaven and hell reside. Ask yourself if you see the same thing in Renoir's work as the next person. Ask yourself if the Mona Lisa is not stil interpreted differently by every person who views her 500+ years later. Ask my wife why the Coat of Hammurabi meant as much as Michelangelo's slaves did to me. Ask her why Monet's Lillies at the L'orangerie, down the promenade of dead-winter's gardens from the Louvre, meant as much to her.<br><br>Art, letter, music and war are history the minute they are done. Each is left to the ages for understanding, and we will find whatever meaning we either desire or need in all of them. That having been said, then, if you find demons in the back-masking - that is your thruth - but yours alone.<br><br>It is an ontological question - What vessel or being holds the real truth for you? For certain, the ages hold some of it: time, people and the earth thereupon tread. So, tread as much as you can, body, mind and soul. 'The truth will come to you at last. . .' <br><br>The truth lies in that Being that fully holds your body, mind and soul. Whoever that be, let it be something bigger and better than you alone. Then you can find 'Quarter,' in your wanderings. <br><br>If you are alone and untraveled in your back-masking treck, what you DO find will lack the Hope of the, "two paths you can go by. . . and the [time, still], to change the road you're on." Evil and demonic quirks exist, and finding those is fine. Try to avoid searching them out alone and/or without perspective. What you don't know can hurt.</span>

         <span class="commentext">What else might one say about Rock's most famous song? Well, let's give it up to the most talented, spirit-driven, four musicians ever on stage and thank them. They took yesterday's pain and relieve today's. Let's remember not to be afraid of the spirituality. <br><br>Most recently reminded by Bonnie Raitt, I call the tune - 'Religion is for those afraid of going to hell. Spirituality is for those who have already been there and back.' Leave Satan out and follow your spirit - that 'Lady still believes all things. . . .' I don't. Those four men left a gift to the ages. Leave Satan out and allow for some mysticism - you might find your 'soul is taller than your shadow', and you might find your freedom.</span>

         <span class="commentext">You notice "they" did the same thing to the Beatles and said there were messages that Paul was dead played backwards in Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and the album cover had hidden messages, etc. etc. All hokey. Led Zeppelin was not a media and press favorite. Successful and famous people have legendary rumours follow them all the time. As far as satanic dabbling by Jimmy Page??? Has he ever admitted it? He looks pretty harmless now doesn't he at age 62. Stairway to Heaven can be played all the time for all I care......Jimmy Page's guitar still gives me goose bumps when I hear it.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Whichever people made up the rumours about satanic messages in Stairway (or any song)were probably label owners or radio D.J's that wanted the public to buy their record. I mean, you either think thats a totally amazing idea and decide to go buy the song to hear it for yourself, or you think its the stewpidest rumour and you want to proove whoever made it up wrong. Either way, you buy the song and the label owners make more money. Not only do these rumours make a tremendous cash grab, but they make the public want to hear the song all the time so the band (in this case Led Zeppelin) become even more popular if they're weren't already. The song starts getting played all over the radio because the listeners want to hear it, and D.J's end up getting more money for playing that particular song. It's all an elaborate plan to make more money. Then, once we've all bought and listened to the song backwards we start aruing with eachother about what the hidden messages really ment. Almost 40 years later and we're still picking at Stairway trying to figure out what the band was trying to say to us, the devoted fans, because we would love to know what our idols were telling us through secret messages. The higher- ups made big money, the band gets better known and the fans have something to talk about in later years to come. Brilliant idea once you really think about it.</span>

         <span class="commentext">The the person that made this post "There are roughly 600 AOR and Classic Rock stations in the US, which means that "Stairway" has been broadcast a minimum of 2,874 times. At 8 minutes per spin, roughly 23 million minutes - almost 44 years - have been devoted to the song. So far."<br><br><br>Perhaps you should do your math again. If STH has been broadcast a minimum of 2,874 times at 8 minutes per spin, thats only 22,992 minutes. Not 23 million minutes. Thats only 16 days played consecutively.<br><br>Now I'm pretty sure that its been played more times than you listed, but in order for a 36 year old song that have been played for the equivalent of 44 years, the song would have to be being played at some point every minute, of every day since its release, and it would still be 8 years short.</span>

         <span class="commentext">this is a very beautiful song but it creeps me out a bit because of the whole Satan thing which i don't know whether or not its true.... but how could someone know what their song will sound like played backwards, I think its just a coincidence...but what's the deal with the "Piper"?<br>Ever notice how everyone who plays guitar makes it a point to be able to play stairway to heaven?</span>

         <span class="commentext">with the whole satanic messages thing i have taken the song, myself, and reversed it. it does,coincidentally, say satan and the rest of the message does say what sounds like words. i also tried recording myself just saying the lyrics forward and reversing them but it wasnt at all the same. my conclusion is that Combined with Plants extraordinary note range and coincidentally the words of the song there are eligable words when you play the song backwards</span>

If you think about it, only Led Zeppelin could make this. If I think about the Who or the Beatles singing this, it's pretty funny. Whenever I hear the opening notes, I get the chills. My favorite part, though, is "Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow/and did you know/your stairway lies on the whisperin wind" since that's the part right before the solo and pretty much the only part I remember from hearing it for the first time.</span>

One could say that the lady is on the wrong path and Jesus is the piper. Others could say that She is on the right path and the piper is leading her away. The thing is that there is so many powerful yet uncertain lines in this song that it cannot be made clear which is right. The song really lends itself to interpretation. I think that's what I take from the song most. We cannot always be sure if we are right. "Cause you know words sometimes have two meanings", "Sometimes all our thoughts are misgiven", and you know "It makes me wonder." hahaha</span>

         <span class="commentext">The funny thing is, the forward version of STH is the backward version. That's how spot-on this band was. They went to the studio that day (instead of night) all wearing their clothes turned inside out. Beforehand, instead of eating, they puked. They switched instruments, nailing them to the ceiling, Bonham with picks played the drums in his pajamas while on the phone with his mom. He usually called his dad. <br>Instead of sweating during the session, they collectively became a kind of dragon pants de-humidifier. But to keep the song in rhythm etc. they decided to first NOT keep it in rhythm and so when they began it was still, indeed, the backward or opposite version.</span>

I don't think the song has backwards messaging, is about drugs, or about satan. Jimmy Page one of the best guitarists ever isn't sadistic. Just because he lives in Aleister Crowley's old house doesn't make him sadistic. John Bonham one of the world's best drummers isn't sadistic either. Led Zeppelin is one of the best bands ever.That's a fact not opinion, their not sadistic and even in the slight possibility that it has backward messaging it has nothing to do with satan. Like i said with Hotel California, Led Zeppelin won't tell people what the song means because it wouldn't be talked about and played as much.</span>

It can be done through not only backmasking, but also propaganda. Subliminal messaging is always done on purpose.<br>Songs like Stairway to Heaven use Secret Messaging, which is fun to figure out but does not give you the urge to do what you are told is in the backmasked song.

(Oops, what happened to our soul?)<br>There walks a lady we all know (the materialist from the first verse in on our path....uh oh!)<br>Who shines white light and wants to show (she has not realized where she is)<br>How everything still turns to gold. (whe won't give up her "worship" of material items (i.e. false idols))<br>And if you listen very hard <br>The tune will come to you at last. (you realize what has happened, you are "lost" and cast into hell)<br>When all are one and one is all (all angles are one in heaven and all sinners are one in hell)<br>To be a rock and not to roll.

         <span class="commentext">Ok. Led Zeppelin were not satantists, are not satanists and probably never will be. The song is about materialism and (non satanic!!) spirituality. There is a woman who thinks all that glitters is gold, i.e. that all that's good in life is money and material possesions. The song is about taking the 'spiritual' path as opposed to the path of materialist Western society ("there's a feeling I get when I look to the west, and my spirit is crying for leaving"). The band were intrigued by ancient British culture, and it's demise to the modern world. The May Queen is an example of this - she was a 'goddess' who bought the spring, and along with it hope and happiness. To sum up the song, the lady finds that she cannot be truly happy, and cannot enter heaven. In my opinion, the "two paths" are greed and materialism, and spirituality and love. If we choose the right path then a new day will dawn and the forests will echo with laughter. But no one will ever truly understand the true meaning and refereces of the entire song, probably even Plant.</span>

A bustling in the Old Forest would be alarming if caused by anything but the master, Tom Bombadil. And in LOTR Bombadil did make a bustling, getting water lillies for his pretty lady, Goldberry. This did take place in the fall, but when it rained while they hobbits were with Tom and Goldberry, they called it her cleaning day. It really does fit pretty well wit the lyrics, but not with Galadriel, and i think that this song is definatley about her.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Okay, this song is great and I listen to it at times, more then once. But he HAS admitted that there IS a satanic message in it. I've seen it when I've searched led Zeppelin and the satanic messages came up on blacksheep or whatever. It's during "If theres a bustle in your hedgerow". Im not sure if the whole song has messages in them or not or if another piece just has it. Near the end it also says: "And if you listen very hard, the tune will come to you at last." That probaby supports the theory that there are satanic messages in it. Anyway, for all the people who think "What the HELL?" It's apparently about a girl that sould her soul to the devil to go to heaven which makea NO sense (sorry for spelling, I nkow I porbably spelled sense worng) to me at all. But I still think it's an awesome song.</span>

Even so, this song is a piece of musical genious. to be honest, the lyrics doen't make that much sense, but if you want good lyrics listen to Pink Floyd.</span>

         <span class="commentext">when i first heard this song i was listening to the part where it goes "if theres a bustle...." . And I said to myself "wow, why is he saying stuff so weirdly?" For example if you listen to the end of that part where it goes "theres still time to change the road your on" (at the end of that part)he actually says "theres still" like "en Dere's steewll..." So i just thought is was part of the song, done on purpose, but not TO HAVE any purpose. But I'm pretty sure when one of my friends told me to listen to that part backwards, that I was wrong. "Here's to my sweet satan..." was not very clear, but since i already knew what the voice was going to say, i could just barely make out what he was saying.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Interesting comment from Mike from MA and one of the reasons a lot of people don't get what Zeppelin was about. Contrary to popular belief, they weren't a heavy metal band, per se, but they helped lay the foundation. They weren't even a hard rock band, although they could kick ass better than anyone. Zeppelin was a fusion of blues, English traditional folk, funk, some country and then... rock. The fact of the matter is that few bands have the range to play everything well and Zeppelin did. Stick to ACEC, Mike. I and and few others on this page prefer Zep.</span>

         <span class="commentext">There is a disagreement about the backwards messages in the song stairway to heaven. The big argument is are the messages done on purpose, or done completely by accident? <br><br>A PERSON WHO BELEIVES IN THE SUBLIMINAL MESSAGING WOULD SAY: I think that these messages are done are purpose for 1 main reason. 1) I think there is no way you can possibly make a message when you play the song backwards, unless you were writing the lyrics like that on purpose. Page could've wrote other lyrics instead of <br>"If there's a bustle in your hedgerow<br>Don't be alarmed now<br>It's just a spring clean for the May Queen<br>Yes there are two paths you can go by<br>but in the long run<br>There's still time to change the road you're on" <br><br>But he chose those words because he knew they would make a special message, somehow. <br><br>HOWEVER A PERSON WHO DOESNT BELEIVE IN THE SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES WOULD SAY:<br><br> I do not beleive in the satanic messages because it is just a rumour that has been spread. If you were the first one to listen to the song backwards, you would not hear the words <br><br>"Heres to my sweet satan. the one whose little path would make me sad, whose power is satan. He'll give you 666"....and so on <br>You would just hear fuzzy static. <br>Either way, stairway to heaven is always going to be the best song ever (Even if it is a little overplayed)</span>

         <span class="commentext">The "Satanic" messages are a psychological illusion called pareidolia. When you are interacting with something very vague, for example an image, or in this case a sound, people are generally in a state of increased suggestability. So if you are told there is a "Satanic" message hidden in a barely audible sound, then you hear it, your mind will make things fit and you will really believe it. Very simply, you are hearing what you want to hear. Another popular example of pareidolia is people seeing images of Jesus in their toast. Vague images being misinterpreted.</span>

If you listen closely on the album, you can hear the "punch-ins," places where the recording engineer, Eddie Kramer, edited the tracks. (thanks, Dan - Montreal, Canada)"<br>Wrong! Jimmy recorded the solo in 1 take. Normally he would make 3 and pick the best. It was a one shot deal using Jeff becks 58 telecaster.</span>

         <span class="commentext">You honestly don't need to look for backwards hidden messages in Led Zeppelin songs, especially this one, as it already has a satanic message forwards. <br><br>"If we all call the tune/ Then the piper will lead us to reason..." the piper being Lucifer the Piper and the 'tune' being the ways of the occult. "Yes there are two paths you can go by/ But in the long run/There's still time to change the road you're on" is saying there are two paths in existence--through God or through Satan and it's never too late to change sides. "Your head is humming and it won't go/ In case you don't know/ The piper's calling you to join him..." Listen to this song stoned and this lyric will be completely clear to you. I'm not wrong.<br><br>"I think that any group can hit you differently when you're stoned. You can listen to a group when you're straight and it feels one way, and you can listen to it while stoned and it becomes more intense. You're able to pick out more of what the group is trying to show you"<br>-- Robert Plant<br><br>..."And if you listen very hard/ The tune will come to you at last."</span>

         <span class="commentext">I don't like Stairway to Heaven as much as I probably should. It's a brilliant song, but it's not Zep's best work. The problem with LZ is that most people are unfamiliar with their body of work because Zep chose not to release singles. I think they would be even a bigger band than they were if they had released singles and that's saying something since there are just a handful of bands as successful (Beatles, Rolling Stones, U2... can't think of anyone else). Zep's true strength was was the amazing combination of John Bonham on drums (arguably the best rock drummer of all time)with John Paul Jones' on bass (with the exception of Red Hot Chilly Pepper's Flea, I can't think of a better bassist) and then Jimmy Page, who in spite of what John Dylan of Blah, MS<br>wrote earlier, produced some of the most memorable rock riffs of all time. Jimi Hendrix was a better guitarist, but no one in rock history has created better riffs than Jimmy Page -- no one. Even Eric Clapton can't boast of better riffs, although he's a terrific guitarist and technically better than Page. Listen to "Good Times, Bad Times" on Led Zeppelin I and "Moby Dick" on Led Zeppelin II if you want to hear some of Bonham's great drumming. I can't even begin to mention Page's amazing kickass riffs, but "Bring it on Home" on Led Zeppelin II is a good start. Listen to both the guitar riff and the drums if you want to be blown away. Now, that said, I never liked Plant as much as guys like Jagger and Jim Morrison. On the other hand, I prefer him to Geddy Lee of Rush, or Brian Johnson of ACDC. Get the DVD if you want to get blown away.</span>

I mean honestly, to be able to write a song in a way that played backwards it actually means something, theres no way. I admit there are songs with obvious intentional backmasking, like Empty Spaces by Pink Floyd, but songs like that have a message that was recorded and reversed when put into the song.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Ok, apparently my previuos posts have fallen on deaf ears, on those with selective hearing, or the down-right ignorant.So here are some facts to think about.<br>1. I've spoken with former drug abusers, and a majority of them have told stories that their drug abuse "opened" doors to evil. This affect seems to be related with alot of murders, some famous ones being the Manson and Defeo murders. <br>2. Jimmy Page WAS INTERESTED in Crowley's teachings. Aleister Crowley had admitted to being anti-christian, a drug user. There have also been instinces where Crowley has been seen and heard conjurring demons and taking part in other such rituals (and wow Page Crowley and all of Led Zeppelin were drug abusers. what a coincidence!) <br>3. Now, with the facts that are listed above, I definately wouldn't rule out satanic messages in this song.<br>4. I do listen to zeppelin's music every-so-often, so I don't want to be perceived as anti zeppelin; but I do personally believe that there are satanic messages in this song.

         <span class="commentext">Ok, let's dispell the "satan" BS now. So Plant was into Crowley and other pagan/occult stuff. Beginning with Crowley... Alister Crowly was a lot of things, a chess master, mountain climber, sexual revolutionist, pagan (including Hermetic, Eqyptian [Thelmic] and combined with Buddism, Tantra, Freemasonry and Yoga to name a few), drug addict (heroin prescribe for his asthma and bronchitis) but he was NEVER a satanist. He was pagan. Pagans DO NOT beleive in an entity called "satan". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alister_Crowley <br>As for the "backwards message baloney" - it's just that . . . baloney. People who spend time thinking up and "exposing" such things are trying to get something for themselves (fame, fortune, notariety) or destroy and hurt someone else.

Yes Jimmy Page lives in Mr. Crowleys house but theres more evidence of meaning in the frontwards version. I heard that some sited this book called "Mystic (something) in Celtic Britian" and the LOTR thing isnt too farfetched either. Does it have a depper meaning? I dont know... It seems to be about self-purification...but this is just my theory. But the satanic bull is pretty rediculas. I could listen to the Backstreet Boys backwards and probably find some dark message or the word "satan". You guys only find it because you are looking for it.</span>

         <span class="commentext">If there was a top 40 of backmasked songs, then "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin would be at the top. This song contains many backward messages. Here is one of them that occurs right at the very end of the song when Plant sings "And She's Buying a Stairway, To Heaven" It says: "Play backwards. Hear words sung." You have to listen realy carefully and play it slowly. It realy sounds like it is supposed to be there where as a conversation may be choppy or hard to comprehend this is acctualy very simple to find like somone would try to sing it there like that.<br><br>However, by far the most controversial backward messages on the song can be found in the following soundtrack. They say backwards just about where Plant sings: "If there's a bustle in your hedgerow,Don't be alarmed now, It's just a spring clean for the May queen,Yes there are two paths you can go by, But in the long run, There's still time to change the road you're on" From the word "on" at the end of that line play backwards and it will play like this "la la Its my sweet Satan. The one whose little! path would make me sad whose power is, fake! He gives you 666, there-was-a little toolshed where he made us suffer, sad Satan!" Try listening at a slower speed if you can't here it. It is definatly supposed to be there. Although Page reportedly said that the writing of this song was all Sincere we have forgotten that it was John Paul Jones who suggested "Try listening to Stairway To Heaven backwards, Robbert hid some little easter eggs in there."</span>

         <span class="commentext">okay, here we go again...<br><br>this is very important to everyone, especially newcommers to the zepplin phenomena.<br><br>research has shown that there actually is no message in the song. GET THAT?!?! NO MESSAGE *NONE* **NADDA** ***ZIP***!!!!!<br><br>here is the explaination: the reason you hear the message, is you have been "tricked" into hearing it, by your own mind. When you read the supposed lyrics, your subconcious associates them with the sounds being played backwards. in actuallity, it's nothing but giberish. but when you read the lyrics that are associated with the sounds, lo and behold, a satanic message. Suffice to say, if you listen to the backwards lyrics BEFORE reading them you will hear some vaugly robert-plant-like gibberish. if you listen to them AFTER reading the lyrics then, and only then, will you hear the message.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Actually I like classic rock, The Beatles, Dylan, ect. I like musicians who actually know how to play, compose, and write. Page often sounds like he is playing just a bit over his skill level and he never wrote an interesting or memorable chord arrangement. If you want to hear someone play the guitar check out Tommy Emmanuel. As to modern music I think creativity died with innovation once formulaic bands like Zeppelin started the down fall of music in to hair metal and the like.</span>

Then he plays the most overused chord cycle in rock music (Am G F G:) and improvises in an A-minor Pentatonic scale for way to long. To be fair though the music sounds almost good when compared to Plants attempt(failed) at a dramatic bluesy vocal. He sounds like someone put a beartrap on his testicles a few minutes before the session. I won't even get into the crappy lyrics or Jones shot at a walking bassline. The song doesn't suck as much as a lot of other songs, but the problem is that it is shoved down in our ears like so much unwanted elk penis.</span>

It is know a typical christian phrase "there is only one way to haven and it nos a stairway" the woman of the song is taking the wrong way to what she sees as heaven, a stairway to heaven(drugs), it can be also be seen as the easy way to a false haven. I think that the idea of how drugs turn the most important thing in a person´s life is also present in the song, not only in the physical dependence so as in the way thinking.</span>

I didn't know about the story of the message, until I registered here. Part of the reason I don't believe in the message is because most songs that are said to contain them don't. The only ones that seem to actually contain backwards messages are "Rain" by the Beatles and "Empty Spaces" by Pink Floyd. Others are harder to prove.</span>

Im usualy not a believer in this but with the things I have read about Zeppelin. they did some wierd stuff. And this whole thing seems to go together.

I think that this song could have somthing to do with the old idea that was out of the catholic church selling "indulgences." These were papers sold by the pope to make money and were often called "A persons STAIRWAY INTO HEAVEN." Allowing you to pass your waiting years and go right to heaven. Maybe its about a women who spent lost of money on these and then when they stopped selling them she found out that they were useless. And she was trying to buy herself into heaven. May be dumb but thats an idea I had like 10 seconds ago while listening to swth. Post thoughts Thanks.</span>

The backplaying says nothihg about Lucifer, but does have words that sound like "Satan" i think this is the biggest coincidence ever expecially with the Aleister Crowley referances, SUPER big coincidence, i dont know much about led zeppelin, and this is the only song he made that i know of. by the way at the time of the song there was no way to hear this "message" people say thats in it. If it was there on Purpose , i think he was paid or it was a bet or something like that. and las thing i think this is a good song with good influnce on people and rock(i mean when played forewards),</span>

They can't handle the fact that music is that deep, and that these artists that are outside their religion, have accessed the eternal magic that it really is!

Even if this is possibly THE greatest rock song of all time, its not a definition of ALL rock, so rock as a genre is not evil just like cuz of this song. TO EVERYONE WHO THINKS THIS SONG IS ABOUT SATAN: i love this song, i find it a part of my life, but i am nowhere near worshipping satan. this song (whether intended to be or not by zeppelin) is not evil to me. its everyones personal choice whether this song is evil to them, with a song this good, mysterious and popular, even led zeppelin themselves no longer control the meaning. at least how we interpret the meaning. so my point is: its your choice whether this song is evil. if you think it is thats great for you if you choose to interpret it a different way your meaning is just as legitimate.</span>

         <span class="commentext">i'm still not going to say whether or not it is satanic backwards because i haven't listened to it, but whatever i doubt led zeppelin sat down one day and were like "haha it would be fun to put messages about satan for those who listen to stairway to heaven backwards" and then they just did. another thing, if they were gonna put satanic messages they would put it on a song that would be a huge hit because otherwise no one would listen to it backwards. they didn't even think stairway would be a hit but satanic messages appear coincidentally on what would be the number one song on the radio! that to me sounds more like something someone would try to figure out AFTER it became a hit, which puts led zeppelin out of the picture! so basically even though i said i was just gonna ignore whether or not there are satanic references, now i am kind of taking sides with those who say there aren't. From now on can we please focus of the meaning of songs FORWARDS instead of BACKWARDS?.</span>

(that is 3/4 of his essay) 2. stairway IS the number one song on the radio.(half of whats left) 3. he wants to hear a full version of stairway on a radio station because it is hard to find. (until the end) with a few more details thrown in. so yes it is a good essay but it is incredibly long so anyone interested might just want to read my summary.</span>

         <span class="commentext">uhhh E...people usually only get really defensive if there is some truth to the accusation. I openly admit to taking offense to your original post because I KNOW my post was really long. Probably the longest one, and by this deduction, I took a wild guess that you were directing your comment at me. I'll try to keep this one a little shorter to accomodate your attention span. YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ ANYTHING YOU DON'T WANT TO! That's the beauty of it, isn't it? And if you quit posting here "years ago" because you didn't want to read about people over-analyzing Stairway, then why are you here now? What else are people on a message board to discuss a song going to post? "Hey man, I love that song"...or "This song rocks" and that's it? What would be the point of that? And if you think I am the only one to analyze a song lyric by lyric, you are sadly mistaken. Go visit the "Hotel California" page for instance. And there was ONLY one reference to my poetry, not a whole diatribe on my "hobbies". If you read it all, like your complaint suggests, you would have realized that. Which goes back to my original point: People get the most defensive when there is some truth to the accusation. OK, so maybe you aren't illiterate, but you obviously have some reading comprehension, spelling, and vocabulary problems.</span>

         <span class="commentext">well when i first heard about the "stairway to hell" fact, that some parts are weird messeages backwards, i had a program on my computer that lets u edit audio. so i took that piece of stairway to heaven and reversed it on the program. and the websites dont lie. i took the raw material and listened to it backwards, and it is clear when it says, "If theres a butsle in ur hedgerow, dont be alarmed now, its just a spring clean for the may queen, yes there are 2 pathst u can go on, but in the long rung, theres still time to change the road ur on." WHICH BACKWARDS IS "Oh heres to my sweet satan, the 1 who little path would make me sad whose power is satan, We would promise him 666, there was a little toolshed where he made us suffer sad satan" WELL, that is no lie. AND IF U DONT BELIEVE ME, GO TO AUDACITY.COM and DL THE SOFTWARE&lt; ITS FREE i really dont beleive zepplin meant much by it, but it wasnt a coincidence that that happened. It was on purpose, how IN ALL WAYS COULD SOME1 SAY 5 SENTENCES IN A ROW ABOUT THE SAME TOPIC, ON ACCIDENT?? so its clearly on purpose they supposedly bought this mansion somewhere in europe and it was "haunted". It had spooky incidents with satan, or just freaky things happen there. And the owners had installed a tooleshed near it, so thats what plant or page meant by the toolshed part of the backwards verse THATS ALL<br>- isaac, sd, CA<br><br>i agree with issac now, at first i thought it was humbo jumbo, but i tried it and it is in therr well i cant hear this partWe would promise him 666<br>but there rest is in there, and if you notice, unless you get the official lyrics you cant really understand what hes saying even when its forwards, maybe its just a joke, a mystry but led zeppelin is definetly not stainic</span>

         <span class="commentext">After reading through the bazillion threads pertaining to STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, maybe it was 'Sweet Satan's' influence, I'm not sure'I was compelled (maybe possessed) to add my very open-ended, meditative, thought provoking, sarcastic, modest view. Truth is, music, as art and beauty, is all about interpretation. I write poetry, and I do not speak in the same manner as I write. I use different words to either be metaphoric, or simply because they sound good. People don't always get the same point I was meaning when I wrote it. It's actually interesting and insightful to hear others interpretations. Sometimes I sit back and read what I wrote and think, 'Where the hell did that come from?'. Maybe I become possessed by a 'Muse', but certainly not a 'Satan'. Perhaps it is the same with songwriters, like Robert Plant. Once in the 'zone', things just come as they will, which in my opinion, many times results in the most beautiful and thought provoking songs. The lyrics to this song have always inspired me, since my cousin tried to teach me to play it on guitar when I was 10 (Is there anyone who doesn't know how to play this?).<br><br>As for the Satanic message some seem to find in the lyrics, forwards and backwards, try to follow this scenario. The year is 1970. Woodstock has everyone up in arms thinking the youth are going to hell in a little hand basket and Rock and Roll is to blame. People are actually thinking for themselves, and feeling empowered by much of the music of the time, which of course to many conservatives is rebellious, disrespectful and down-right dangerous. <br>So here we go'just picture any Televangelist, let's say Pat Roberts for example, screaming the following:<br>Evil Rock band sells soul to Satan to attain material riches'in turn, as members of Satan's legion, band must seduce the masses (especially young virgins'would make a great horror movie) with back-masked lyrics ('Ha ha'the fools won't even realize they are being converted since this is all subliminal'), promoting the worship of the aforementioned Evil Stereotype and whipping everyone into 'tool sheds' (A. Crowely reference) practicing black masses, and of course, wild orgies. Now, for you disbelieving heretics (vein popping out of head, sweat on brow), here's the 'proof'! (State the following as fact, not mere speculation or rumor, of course)'Robert Plant, after sacrificing a black goat to his master, channels the spiritually ambiguous lyrics, using automatic writing, while staring into a fire (representing the flames of hell)'meanwhile, far away in the haunted mansion (or Satanic Church referenced as 'The Toolhouse/shed') formerly owned by Satanist-extraordinaire Aleister Crowley, Jimmy Page pieces together guitar riffs to hypnotize the listener with a lilting, soothing intro. Magically, the lyrics match the music perfectly. And if this isn't proof enough, you nay sayers, Satan would want all of you debating whether the song is about Heaven or Hell, because Lucifer comes as the bearer of light to 'mask' his darkness. And as we all know, knowledge (or seeking, as in the Occult studies attributed to Page) is DANGEROUS and can certainly lead to temptation, which in turn leads to following Satan's tune, which of course leads your immortal soul to perish in the fiery flames. The great thing is, all the lonely, depressed teenagers smoking pot will get bored (and hungry) and decide to do something unspeakable'like play the record backwards'and that's where he GETS YA! 'Ha Ha, Sucker! You're mine now! Play this little ditty for all your friends'spend hours deciphering if I said 'My sweet Satan' or 'Might be hatin'!'<br> Sweet Satan! I could go on for hours! We could debate on the whole backmasking phenomena, but as I am certainly no expert, my thoughts would only be speculative and a matter of opinion. However, seeing as the lyrics played forward have caused as much debate, I will add my two (or ten) cents worth with my personal interpretation of the lyrics, that for some reason, have everyone grabbing their children's ears and running to their nearest church. <br>DISCLAIMER: I am in no way implying that my interpretation is what Plant/Page had in mind when writing this song.<br><br>There's a lady who's sure-All that glitters is gold-And she's buying a stairway to heaven.<br>~The optimistic naÃ¯vetÃ? of youth-thinks happiness is a commodity easily attained. The 'lady' is simply a metaphor or ideal, not a 'real lady' necessarily. The beginning of the journey.<br><br>When she gets there she knows-If the stores are all closed-With a word she can get what she came for.<br>~No longer naÃ¯ve, has learned that happiness is not bought and sold, but you can manipulate yourself into perceiving happiness. Naively believing one has 'found what they're looking for'.<br><br>There's a sign on the wall-But she wants to be sure-'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.<br>~No longer believing all at first glance-knowing things aren't always what they seem-experience is the great teacher<br><br>In a tree by the brook-There's a songbird who sings,-Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.- Ooh, it makes me wonder<br>~Pondering existence-Conscience-judgment of deed and thought-the songbird being the 'little voice inside your head'-hindsight<br><br>There's a feeling I get-When I look to the west,-And my spirit is crying for leaving.<br>~Looking back on past experience with regret-possibly a feeling of 'guilt'-beating yourself up-remorse and regret<br><br>In my thoughts I have seen-Rings of smoke through the trees,-And the voices of those who standing looking.-Ooh, it makes me wonder<br>~Feeling judged by others, when really we judge ourselves most harshly. The 'smoke' being the deception in this belief.<br><br>And it's whispered that soon-If we all call the tune-Then the piper will lead us to reason.<br>~'Seek and you shall find'-Spiritual self-discovery (The search for truth)<br><br>And a new day will dawn-For those who stand long-And the forests will echo with laughter<br>~Happiness is only attained once peace is made with self-once truth is found-A reawakening<br><br>If there's a bustle in your hedgerow-Don't be alarmed now,-It's just a spring clean for the May Queen.<br>~OK'here is where so many of the posts went awry'Here is my American version of 'bustle in your hedgerow''literally a 'rustling in the bushes''figuratively, a change of thinking, a slight state of confusion, a disorder of thoughts, upheaval or chaos that comes with change'don't be afraid of the reordering of the 'chaos''the May Queen being either the 'lady' herself or a concept of a higher Spiritual being (like Goddess or God, take your pick).<br><br>Yes, there are two paths you can go by-But in the long run-There's still time to change the road you're on.<br>~There are always two choices: the one you chose and the one you don't. No matter how many options, there are only two choices-'what you do' and all else falls under the category of 'what you don't'. It's never too late-Choices aren't always end-all be-all. You are allowed to change you're mind. You can take the next exit. You can do a U-Turn. You can change your 'destiny'. You are in control on this journey we call 'life'.<br><br>Your head is humming and it won't go-In case you don't know,-The piper's calling you to join him<br>~Negative thoughts-being drawn back to the chaos-Not literally a 'him' being the Piper, or Satan'an ideal of addiction or longing'the thought of 'it's too late to change', like time has passed you by.<br><br>Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,-And did you know-Your stairway lies on the whispering wind<br>~Don't listen to the static ('humming'-negativity we sell ourselves)-focus on the beauty (the wind blow)'you are in control of your journey towards truth (your 'stairway' on the 'wind')<br><br>And as we wind on down the road-Our shadows taller than our soul.<br>~Wind on down the road = live and experience'shadows taller than our souls = our 'baggage' we accumulate along the way (during our 'journey')<br><br>There walks a lady we all know-Who shines white light and wants to show-How everything still turns to gold.<br>~The 'lady' is an ideal: we've all 'been there' ' the 'lady' we ALL know'There is redemption and peace, and eventually happiness at the end of your journey'the gold referring to the innocence and naÃ¯vetÃ?

         <span class="commentext">Ok, the Audacity software does work, I tried it and got the same results as I did way back when when my friends and I tried spinning the LP backwards on a turntable... those verses, when played backwards do sound like they are saying something. HOWEVER, I also downloaded about 5 different versions of the song, live versions by Plant, live versions by other bands feat. Plant as well as a couple of versions sung by other vocalists. I then performed the same operation, clipped that part of the song out and reversed it. The result is that when these lyrics are sung, in almost any context and by almost anyone, then recorded and played backwards, they sound like they are voicing the alleged satanic messages. As the final test I recorded myself singing the lyrics without music (no I won't be posting that one) and then played it backwards - and you guessed it, hidden satanic messages in my own recording. So what's the conclusion? The "hidden" messages were not somehow added to recording by the studio as a subliminal gimick.. the trick or coincidence is in the lyrics themselves, so if this were planned it means that Plant had to initally write them knowing how they would sound when sung/recorded/played backwards. Yea right! I consider Plant/Page and the gang to be geniuses but I simply don't credit them with the ability to pull this off... Still not convinced? Then give it a try. Think of your subliminal message, then record it and play it backwards. Now you just have to think of lyrics that can be sung to sound like your message played backwards.. theoretically once your lyrics are reversed they will sound like your hidden message.. but remember that the lyrics have to make sense and be in the context of your song.I am willing to bet that even today, with computers and easy to use software this feat of acoustical manipulation can't be replicated..</span>

         <span class="commentext">Good God almighty...you people with this obsession with the "satanic messages". It would be sad if it wasn't so funny. This song was written over 30 years ago.Why do you imagine the satanic messages are there? For what purpose? Do you deludely imagine Plant and Co were trying to subliminally influence people who heard them and turn them on to satanism? If I put out a record with the hidden lyric "Drop your pants when you hear this and then join The Mormons" you'd think I was bonkers, you wouldn't be on here discussing the "hidden meaning". I've been listening to this album since I first bought it in about 1972; I've heard Stairway thousands of times - it's a great song but it hasn't made me weird or satanic (well, except for the human sacrifice maybe)</span>

         <span class="commentext">first of all.. all of you are quoting the same part of the song and then saying that it says different things backwards... and also backmasking is completely out due to the fact that there is not jibberish in the forward version, so the only way a message is there is if it was written to be there. Now as most of you know plant wrote most of this song on the spot, and i find it very unlikely that he could have written it both ways at the same time in such a short period of time. Some of you believe that "If there's a bustle in your hedgerow ect.." was written later by page. it wasn't. And i'd like to hear your sources (i challenge you to prove that they exist).</span>

If you listen to stairway backwards after reading or hearing what people say it says you will hear it because your mind will subconciously alter the sounds as you hear them to match what you think it'll say. To those of us able to keep reality straight in our minds, or to those who listen to it backwards without ever hearing these rumours, it is nothing but a great song being destroyed. Any song backwards sounds like a couple random words. Some anti-zeppelin loser in the 70s heard 1 or 2 words and build a "satanic message" around it.. anyone who hears this message is A:a slave to their sub concious or B:Clinicly insane</span>

         <span class="commentext">"Alright... where to begin? To those of you who actually believe that there is a satanic message in stairway to heaven... what is wrong with you? Do you honestly think that Plant (or page as some of you believe) sat down and wrote a song that was a best seller forwards and a satanic prayer backwards? Page did research and believe aleister crowleys teachings, but he didnt worship satan. His friends, bandmates and family have said so, his ex girlfriends have said so, and most importantly, he has said so. Now if you want to believe that there is a hidden satanic message, go right ahead.... But never can you consider yourself an expert on Led Zeppelin."<br><br><br>And you can't either. There is obviously a message in there. Any "expert" should know that there is a message in thier. I don't belive I know that there is one. I don't know if it was intentional or not. But everyone said it wasn't. But on the facts part it said that Robert Plant said in an interview that ti felt like he wasn't writing but his hand was writing for him. <br>Also what it says<br>"Oh herre's to me sweet Satan. The one who's little path would make me sad who's power si satan. He'll give you give you 666. There was a little tool shed where he made us suffer. Sad Satan"<br>Agian the bad grammer "he'll give you give you 666" could be because it was not intentional or that it was hard to find something to say it straight and make sence. But for it to fit in the song and say something like that backwards is flabbergasting. If it is intentional or not. And fi ti was intentional it doesn't mean it means anything. It could just be Led Zeppling proving that they can "master" the music.</span>

         <span class="commentext">well when i first heard about the "stairway to hell" fact, that some parts are weird messeages backwards, i had a program on my computer that lets u edit audio. so i took that piece of stairway to heaven and reversed it on the program. and the websites dont lie. i took the raw material and listened to it backwards, and it is clear when it says, "If theres a butsle in ur hedgerow, dont be alarmed now, its just a spring clean for the may queen, yes there are 2 pathst u can go on, but in the long rung, theres still time to change the road ur on." WHICH BACKWARDS IS "Oh heres to my sweet satan, the 1 who little path would make me sad whose power is satan, We would promise him 666, there was a little toolshed where he made us suffer sad satan" WELL, that is no lie. AND IF U DONT BELIEVE ME, GO TO AUDACITY.COM and DL THE SOFTWARE&lt; ITS FREE <br>i really dont beleive zepplin meant much by it, but it wasnt a coincidence that that happened. It was on purpose, how IN ALL WAYS COULD SOME1 SAY 5 SENTENCES IN A ROW ABOUT THE SAME TOPIC, ON ACCIDENT?? so its clearly on purpose<br> they supposedly bought this mansion somewhere in europe and it was "haunted". It had spooky incidents with satan, or just freaky things happen there. And the owners had installed a tooleshed near it, so thats what plant or page meant by the toolshed part of the backwards verse<br><br>THATS ALL</span>

         <span class="commentext">For all you people out there that think there are satanic messages hidden in Stairway to Heaven let me tell you first that music is NOT supposed be heard backwards, some guys with nothing better to do started doing this and found out that 'Paul is dead' in Abbey Road. When you write a song it's not possible to know how it's going to sound backwards, our mind doesn't work that way, it can't be done. If you want you can give it a try, just record something and play it backwards, it all sounds 'satanic', even holy music.<br>If you think you are hearing some message it's nothing more than a big coincidence.<br>If Stairway to Heaven was recorded now days, no one would now about this 'messages' because you can't play cd's backwards, in fact, since they started making cds in the 80's nobody found new 'messages' in rock songs.</span>

         <span class="commentext">First of all, this song has two meanings... hence the line "and you know sometimes words have no meanings." The first meaning is about a sinner. She thinks she can buy her way to heaven. She thinks that the only thing worth living for is what she can buy or own and the money she uses to get them. She is wrong as told in the lyrics, "Sometimes all oof our thoughts are misgiven." The singer is also trying to convince the sinner to repent, hence, "yes there are two paths you can go back, but in the long run, there's still time to change the road you're on."<br>Finally the last reference is about how as we live, the darker parts of ourselves (the bad deeds we've done) begin to outweigh the purity of ourselves when we're born. The song says, "And as we wind on down the road, our shadows taller than our souls."<br><br>I also believe there to be some hidden LOTR references in this as well, although I'm not positive but given LZ's track record w/ LOTR, I'd say its pretty likely. The following two lines have reference to both the Grey Havens and the Lady Galadriel....<br>"There's a feeling I get when I look to the west, and my spirit is crying for leaving." AND "There is a lady we all know who shines white light."<br><br>Not fact, just my opinion.</span>

         <span class="commentext">ok people...i certainly believe that the backmasking on this song was done purposely for the following reasons.<br><br>First of all, in the book 'Led Zeppelin . A Celeberation' By Dave Lewis, it states that when the lyrics were written by plant by a the fire as everyone should know, that the verse of 'If there's a bustle in you're hedgerow, don't be alarmed now...' etc. had not been written at the time, and that it had been in fact added into the song by Jimmy Page. Jimmy Page was deep into the teachings of Aleister Crowley and you may think that this is a one off coincidence that the lyrics backwards have satanic messages. <br>But there are two more sections of lyrics in Stairway that are influenced by Aleister Crowley's teachings:<br><br>i). ''There's a lady we all know, who shines white light and wants to show'' - this is referring to Lucifer, ''The bearer of light'' - Satan, but in his female consort. This was a teaching of Crowley's that was used in the lyrics.<br><br>ii). ''Then the piper will lead us to reason '' - This is referring to Pan the Piper - Greek God of the forests, who is presented by Crowley as Lucifer the piper, the maker of music. <br><br>These are two paragraphs of lyrics that are in fact satanic messages influenced by the teachings of Aleister Crowley, and the Satanic Message heard when playing ''If there's a bustle in your hedgerow..'' backwards was obviously put in the song for the specific purpose of the song having multiple satanic messages.<br><br>Hopefully most of you readers can see my point, and that you will all look more into about the lyrics of this song, for people jump straight to conclusions about this song's lyrics and to understand them it requires alot more in-depth research and understanding.</span>

Does the Church have a secret mission to destroy him?<br><br>The Satanic Message may be a...very...coincidental occurance. It is a LOT to be there, and I promise everyone that it DOES sound rather incriminating. However, when observed forwards, the reason the words come out are understandable--the question is about intention.<br><br>Personally, while this song is good, it and Led Zeppelin are far, far overrated. In fact, I don't like Zeppelin.<br><br>Despite this, I would rather listen to them (if it isn't satanic) than something that sounds good and is...music is all about expression.

         <span class="commentext">Oh dearie me. I've just spent about an hour reading all the posts here and I just wanna tie up a few salient points. "Hedgerows" and "bustle" are very commonly used words in England where Led Zep are from, and many of the other images the song conjures up are to do with ancient English folk rituals, the most obvious being The May Queen, ie the woman chosen as Queen of the May Fayre in the pagan ritual (still carried on in rural England today. It celebrates the coming of summer and the villagers' hopes for a fruitful harvest.People dress up as animals, wear clothes made of straw, leaves and flowers, dance traditional dances to old English folk songs passed down the generations. None of this is (including paganism) either satanic or scary - it's just an ancient part of English country life and Led Zep were simply tuning into the Zeitgeist of the 60's and 70's and choosing to write songs about it. In those days we didn't angst so much about "hidden meanings" all the time, I don't think. The 60's and 70's were full of new freedoms and our music reflected that; we celebrated being young, Life, Nature, expanded concsiousness (yep, drugs) and everything else that the previous decades of war, prejudice, sexism and urbanisation had suppressed. The 60's and 70's were the liberation that allowed music to flourish and become the medium of youth expression that it is today. Until then, music was something your Mum played on the radio while she was doing the ironing.</span>

Stairway to Heaven is truly one of the best songs ever written. The intro is poetically brilliant, and just downright awesome. Not too mention the solo at the end is totally kick ass for sure. As for the Satanic messages I don't really believe in all that crap too much, I believe anyone who sits in there basment at 4am playing records backwards will be able to find some sort or "Satanic Message". But honestly, people who think that Robert Plante sat their and INTENTIONALLY wrote these deep and meaningful lyrics and at the same time made a backward message, is absoloutly insane.

We have thought it means: suicide, dying, drugs, sex, a 3 stage life or they were just really stoned. But now we think it means whatever you want it to mean, we can interpret it as many different things, it is just the meaning we want it to be is what we think. Many people think it is about drugs. It makes sense. But so does sex and suicide, too! The satin message when played backwards are STUPID! Nobody would know that if not heard the words first! Then you know what they are going to say, then you pick it out. Truthfully, when I listened to it backwards, the only thing I made out clearly was 666, which is just tiny. It is just like the song "I am the Walrus" by the Beatles! People think they hear "I buried Paul." But is Paul still alive today? YES! so how can you possibly have buried him and he still be alive? My point. EVERY song will probably have some weird word or sentence sound like it shouldn't be there! DEAL WITH IT. Stairway is still the best song and it always will be.</span>

Jimmy Page did it as a joke it meant nothing, and didnt even expect people to even know it was more of a in-joke with the band.<br>SOme of the lines are "Oh my lord sweet satan, true lord of israel" but remember Robert Plant and Page are not satanic, there into mystic stuff and this was a joke after all.</span>

They had to listen to it and learn it after the fact!!!<br><br>im sorry - LZ were fantastic but i just could never understand wy my parents would say "stairway to hevan will be no. 1" 2 songs into a top 1000 of all time countdown. Top 200 maby but not no. 1...<br><br>perhaps if i didnt hear it every day on the radio... overkill!!!!</span>

         <span class="commentext">Although this is probably said (I'm too lazy to read through all of these posts) Stairway to Heaven didn't have an offical meaning (it was just written, or is so said to be). The song seems to have multiple meanings though and change through out the song. The ideas I've heard are that it's about having too many material possesions and stuff and about a woman trying to buy her way intp heaven. It could also be about chosing which rode to take in life, such as being a good person and going to heaven, or being a bad person and going to hell (where the backwards message would fit in). The backwards message (very Satanic, kind of funny though) could also just be put in there as a joke, as ironic (a song about Heaven with a backwards message about satan). Finally, the song could be about heroin (the stairway to heaven resembling heroin, and a person buying heroin when no one is looking or around and then getting high. I think that the materialism is the best guess. It was written in front of a fire in a house with almost no electronics, but now I'm thinking that the satanic message part [forward] doesn't have a meaning (it's just there for the message). The facts that are posted above about it being made actually by the devil are kinda creepy. "Supporting this theory is the fact that Jimmy Page bought Aleister Crowley's house in Scotland, which had become a well known Satanic church and was known as "The Toolhouse." In his books, Crowley advocated that his followers learn to read and speak backwards. (thanks, Tolga - naples, FL)"</span>

I got the lyric's from this web site: http://unoriginal.co.uk/stairwaytoheaven.html and just two be safe I played it in reverse on my own computer and it was a little bit fuzzy but there was no denyin I could make out yes my sweet satan. Third its all a coincidence its just those words in that order I recorded myself say the lines and then played them backwords and still made out the words sweet satan so its no special zeppelin thing it just a chance happening love 2 the world <br> R.I.P.

         <span class="commentext">okay, western folx, descendants of Lord Brahma and brahmanas caste(class),<br><br>I do absolutely agree with the songfacts of this masterpiece;<br><br>As i many times stated "Stairway to Heaven" is the greatest song of all time in the history of the commercial music(Led Zep are beyond commerialism tho') BECAUSE THIS HAS AN INSPIRATION OF THE SUPREME PERSONALITY -LORD KRISHNA(KRSNA)!<br>Okay, Jimmy Page(Chronos, Shiva#1), the Zep main inspirator, thinks is #1 for Zep, and he is right. Robert Plant(VIVAswan, Surya, Rahma-Chandra)considers the song as 'wedding'. And he is right. As it is stated in Srimad Bhagavatam -"Love between man and a woman in this matterial world is but a perverted reflection of the pure and perfect love between Lord Krsna, the Absolute Truth, and His eternal consort- Srimathi Raddha-raani."<br>As I stated many times, people who are concentrated of the consequence and NOT on the reason, are doomed to degradation, not-understanding, ignorance or "TAMAs"(sanskrit)!<br><br>Okay, the song is about a woman who enjoyes only the senses. But it is said that this is a symbolic for the matterilist. Cos we are equal because have immortal soul(jiva-atma) and NOT equal, according to the matterial degradtion(subtle and gross)matter. That why all pseudo-christians(democrats, socialist, liberals)fail- because they fall into ignorance of shiva-maya adoring 'habiru'(hebrew).They have the bodily concept of man, god and existence itself. This this the cult to Lord Shiva(Shua) and his eternal consort-maya(skakti)- "Hexagram", "M-RAj swastika", "iAn-in", etc.<br><br>The songs starts with a peaceful heaven, which is supposed to be the TRANSCEDENTAL world of Lord Krishna and Lady Raddha. The more sould descents into the matter, the more it is trapped into the claws of maya(Shiva's wife). When you hear the flute(John Paul Jones)"mellowthrone" you are immediately sent to Go-local Brindabana(VRAja-bhu, BIR-age, VIRage or a local higher than the 'Golden age' of mankind - SATya yuga, the Upper Astra of Lord Brahma, the first emanation of Krsna in the matterial world....<br><br>....then if you have read the VEDAs and the books of "Bhaktivedanta Book Trust" you will associate all the lyrics by Plant with the realms of Lord Krsna and Brahma...<br><br>As the songs goes on the intensity, tranquility and loudness enhances......It is a beacon of devolution and desending of the soul to the lower worlds...the realm(heaven) of Lord Shiva(jewish 'Ye-shua').Then at the end the dilemma is between Lord Krsna and lady maya to chose from...<br>We know form the VEDA that maya will murder his husband Lord Shiva, just as jews crucified their avatar "Ye-Shua Krsta"...<br><br>http://www.geocities.com/harekrishna68/AMen-brahma-shiva.jpg <br>.......<br><br>..........can you follow me?....</span>

I did look into it, find myself I good backwards track and listen to it. Nothing. Tried again with the lyrics, and there's something (blurry, and impssoible to hear if you don't have a copy of the "lyrics") there. Is it pro-Satan? No. Seems much more to be about the misleadings of Satan ie: "Whose power is Satan" means Satan has no real power, just himself, "The one whose little path would make me sad" following Satan only means sadness and despair, "He'll give those with him 666" at the end of the world, judgement day, all you'll be left with is a number on your forehead. Now, this might just be coincidence, the sounds are random and varying in pitch, and it likely is. And if not, you have the satisfaction of knowing that they purposely put stuff about the misleadings of Satan in there"</span>

         <span class="commentext">Stairway to Heaven played backwards is not the message in the song. The guys have been heard saying it is whatever people believe it is. SO people who can hear the backwards lyrics in the song a believe it is the true message are wrong. And people who believe it is anything else are also wrong because its meaning is different to each individual person. And if you do find the true meaning which i am urging everyone to find it will still be wrong to other people. Stop arguing over it and eventually the tune will come to you at last when all is one and one is all to be a rock and not to roll.</span>

I recorded my friend and I talking for eight minutes, then reversed it. I found that Rita had said, "Mark is gay" on the reversed... I don't know a Mark. My point is that if you record anything for an amount of time, you will find "hidden messages". As for this song's supposed backmasking: You totally need the "lyrics" of it backwards to make it out. Then it's really clear. Of course, I'm sure if I had anything reversed and took time, I could make a complete set of lyrics for it that, if you listened hard enough, you could make out. Even though they were complete rubbish that I had made up. Even if it were there (highly unlikely) then it is saying that Satan makes you suffer.

It was a milestone for us. Every musician wants do to something of lasting quality, something that will hold up for a long time and i guess we did it with 'Stairway'.

Skip if you're bored of this already!) <br>If I hadn't read a 'transcript' while playing this infamous section of Stairway backwards, I don't think I would have interpreted it as anything.<br>While members of Led Zeppelin were apparently into runes, Celtic lore, astrology, the occult, and novels by J.R.R.Tolkein, I think if they were actually into 'Devil worship' we would see more hints or references to Satanism than one single section of song which played backwards can be 'heard' to say something about the Devil.<br>This was just a band who knew how to rock hard like few other groups of musicians in the history of music. I think Dewey Finn would agree that rocking out hard to this kind of music puts it to the Man. ;) As long as there are still albums by bands the likes of Led Zeppelin to listen to, fewer people will feel inclined to find temporary satisfaction in shopping malls, SUVs, and Ikea home catalgoues.</span>

"And it makes me wonder," in the forward lyrics, are Plant thinking about what it will be like when she comes of age.</span>

         <span class="commentext">i got really sick of reading all this bs about satanic messages so i decided to take a much more scientific aproach to this subject. rather than play the song backwards and try to figure out what is being said, i manually wrote out what the song would sound like. for this example i wrote the verse of: if there's a bustle in your hedgerow... well when u reverse that it sounds like this: (if your having troube trying to figure out what the word is, just sound it out. i wrote the words just like they sound) neewk aim eth roaf neelc gnirps a tsuhj sti wown dmrala eeb tnoad. i didn't continue writing anymore, for my point had been proven. i don't get how anybody can look at that and see satanic messages. or the reverse lyrics that say "666" forwards that would be skiss skiss skiss, or even kiss kiss kiss if you really want to stretch it. no words are even close to that in the forward lyrics.</span>

         <span class="commentext">why are we still talking ablut the supposed hidden messages in "stairway"/ You don't automatically write something forwards, and then write lyrics backwards! for one thing, if the lyrics were in the song at all, thebn allyou would hear if you played it forward would be jibberish. For instance, The beatles recorded a song called "Rain" in it you can hear some lyrics thatsound like jibberish forwards. But if you listen to it backwards it's supposed to sound like there saying "sunshine". now I haven't listened to "Stairway" backwards, but I don't think they were put there intensionally.</span>

         <span class="commentext">1) This is a beautiful song. It's so uplifting. Nevertheless, it is very overrated, and I wouldn't have had the idea to play the record backwards. I don't usually become that bored.<br>2) There are just about as many backwards lyrics in Stairway as in any other song. You can find supposed hidden messages in anything...especially if you expect them to be there.<br>3) Even if the supposed backmasked lyrics were actually there, I'm not sure Plant would or could have written them in intentionally. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that isn't too easy to do...especially not if you take the time to write beautiful poetic forwards lyrics.<br>4) Suppose it was on purpose. Shouldn't we be commending instead of condemning? Like I said, that's quite an achievement.<br>4) Who cares which castle Page bought? Maybe he got a good deal.<br>5) In conclusion, I don't think there are any lyrics hidden among this excellent music. And even if there were, so what? The song rocks!</span>

         <span class="commentext">My dad has always told me that the song IS about a girl who does drugs, (shes buying a stairway to heaven). It talks about how sometimes even though we know how bad some things are for us we go ahead and do them anyways because we want to "be sure", like drugs (theres a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure, cause you know sometimes words have two meanings). It also talkes about the way the girl feels when she is on drugs, (theres a feeling I get when I look to the west, and my spirit is crying for leaving...it makes me wonder). It also talks about even if youve made mistakes its never too late to "change the road youre on", (yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run, theres still time to change the road youre on). And even though you might change the way you lived youre life, the things you have done will always be there, (and as we wind on down the road, our shadows taller than our soul). And as you grow older you will realize that just being yourself is what truly matters and to be strong and not "roll" along with what everyone tells you, (and if you listen very hard, the tune will come to you at last, where all are one and one is all..to be a rock and not to roll).</span>

I loved it...up until a couple days ago. I had read all this stuff about the "satanic messages" and i just figured people had way to much time on there hands...but I finally submitted and tried it. I went to many websites and even did it myself...then i was shocked. That definately was no mistake. THere are more then one subliminal messages and at the end of the song it even tells you to play it backwards. I've also been raised a christian so my parents don't really like me listening to them...i now see why. Lol now i'm constantly freaked out whenever i think about it. Thnx to the @$$holes who took the time to tell everyone about a song thats so great and turn it in to satanic messages.

         <span class="commentext">This is what I think. I haven't yet played the song backwards myself, but I intend to one of these days. I think the backmasking is real. However, when I here what Jimmy Page had to say about I don't think they put it in on purpose. Other options? Satan. I'm a Chrisitan (who, incidently, doesn't believe this song has a Christian message) and I believe there is a Force in this world which actively works for evil (I don't believe, as some people do, that just 'cause you here this song you're going to Hell). I think the song is good and I think the fact that is was written so fast (and almost without thinking) backs up the point that Satan inspired it and put in the right words so that when played backwards their Satanic. Robert Plant himself once said that he and Jimmy Page seemed to just be "channles" for music. I don't believe they were Chrisitan's either. Jimmy Page had a satanic room in the castle he bought from Aleister Crowley (who, other have already said, was a famous satanist).</span>

         <span class="commentext">Sumner, I haven't done any research on this yet but, I HIGHLY doubt that any of the Led Zeppelin band members were Christian (especially Jimmy Page who bought perhaps the most widely known satanist's castle); at least when they made Stairway to Heaven. Now if there are any Christians out there, than you all know that you cannot buy yourway into heaven by taking an alternate stairway that bypasses the "main enterance" if you will. This song is definately the farthest thing from Christian!</span>

Its a beautiful song that goes with the Christian faith and has a true moral to it.

         <span class="commentext">I have listened to the backwards lyrics and yes that it is creepy! But if it was some message from satan wouldnt it appear in the live version also? Someone put it there intentionally. Perhaps to boost enthusiam for the song or what not who knows? Why is it that it is only on the studio recorded version? come on! Its a joke! I even listened to a couple other ones - for instance: Queen - Another One Bites The Dust (in the chorus, played backwards you can hear smoking marijuana is fun); Britney Spears - Hit Me Baby One More Time (in the chorus, played backwards you can hear sleep with me im not that young). This all just seems to be for fun and games and it does not nessecarily mean anything! These bands are just trying to get a rise outta ya! I was brought up around this music and heard alot about this sort of thing! Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, The Rolling Stones, The Beetles, and Zeppelin are all said to have these hidden messages! and there are many others im sure! There is an irony to this song, the title "Stairway to Heaven" then the hidden satanio messages. If you pay close attention there are many poetic references, irony being one of them. I believe it has some biblical reference and also poetic. This is a beautifully written song if you pay close attention. The word flow is just so artistic and poetic. That is only one reason why it is such a great song besides all the instrumental. Maybe, they are just trying to get you all to think? Obviously it worked! It is just a song! A song cannot possess anyone to do anything! And if you actually think that, then you are crazy! A song may put you in the mood for something. For instance if you feel like getting on, you might listen to some love making music to set the mood just right (ex. Lets Get It On - Marvin Gaye); If you are getting ready for a sporting event you may listen to certain songs to get you pumped up (ex. We Will Rock You - Queen). If you feel like dancing you will listen to some dance music to get you in that mood. If you feel like rocking you will listen to some zeppelin or some metallica to get you in that mood.. It just depends.. People blaming music for their actions is pure stupidity! It is just an excuse so that they don't take responsibility for their actions so they have to pin it on someone else. Just like the Columbine kids listening to Marilyn Manson supposibly made them go out on their killing rampage! That is BS!! Dont get me wrong, it probaly most likely set the mood for it but its not like he sent a hidden message saying KILL KILL KILL. Come on now people! Let the musicians be musicians! Just leave well enough alone. This is just a publicity stunt, one used to make more money and sell more records. They probaly figured it would reach other listeners and would make a killing off of record sells because all the silly people will look for the hidden messages! If you listened to Zeppelin or not, it probaly still made you curious to see what this craze was that people were talking about it. They just did it to sell some records!!! Just like BLACK SABBATH, THE ROLLING STONES, PINK FLOYD, etc....</span>

I have heard of people who after taking drugs felt an evil prescence within themselves that never went away not even after the drug was supposed to have worn off; now all of the Led Zeppelin band members are known substance abusers. Now, it doesn't take a Rocket Scientist to put 2 and 2 together.And for anyone who may or may not be interested in my interpretation on this song here it is: A woman lives her life not according to the Bible, or any other holy text for that matter, but by her own rules and when she finds out that she's an evil heethan and has no chance of getting into Heaven(eternal bliss and happiness) but only the certainty of being sent to Hell(eternal suffering and pain), she tries to buy her way into Heaven; which by the way ,for any disbelievers out there, is not the way to get into Heaven. <br><br>P.S. It is not my intention to turn this into a debate about religion or religious ethics.</span>

         <span class="commentext">When robert plant said that something else seemed to move the pencil for him he was saying in exaggeration that the song came to him so easy and it flowed so easy on to the paper..now the whole backmasking thing..i listened to it backwards for real..not off a website or some gay thing like that..i played the song over the speakers and recorded the "sweet satan" part of the song then clicked on effects and played it backwards..there was only one thing i thought i heard during the time it was playing backwards..it did sound like plant said play backwards in the beginning but i listened to the rest and it would take someone with a very active imagination to pick up these words out of the song, i belive the song is about NOTHING.. just some very creative words, my second theory is of course the idea that it is about a woman who accumulates a large amount of money, i also checked into the rumor that the line in battle of evermore that said the pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath..sounds nothing like I am the bible spit on me..so if u have any questions just post them and i will clear everything up for you.</span>

Its an awesome song but i dont think it represents the Led zeppelin greatness... Jimmy Page is the best guitarist and not jimi hendrix! also Plant have a great voice, john p jones is great too, but very underrated. Bonzo was one of the best drummers ever.</span>

And besides who would want to own a house where satanic rituals took place, I mean there has to be AT LEAST one other castle/house in scotland with some history.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Sorry to burst anyone's fundo-brainwashed bubble, but there are no satanic messages in this song either. How gullible are people to believe this nonsense? "There was a little toolshed" indeed. Here's something to try : record a conversation in a room using your PC's soundcard and desktop mike. Now reverse that conversation. How many 'words' and 'messages' can you find there? It's like the inkblot test - the 'messages' you discover say more about yourself than anything else. The song has no particular deep meaning, it just uses imagery from Lord Of the Rings (there's a feeling I get when I look to the West), folk tales (Pied Piper) and different mythologies, it can mean whatever you want it to mean. Vaguely antimaterialistic I guess you could say.</span>

         <span class="commentext">All the band was in to reading J.R.R. Tolkien, they rented a castle that had some history to it, and began writing and recording there. Plant lost his child about that time so they all became even more spiritual. Satanic is not what I would call it. They experimented with different English dictions in many of their songs and the backwards tracking was done to mix the vocals and guitars in unison. Nothing satanic there. Just people who didn't know of " Lord Of The Rings " accused them of it. They did research some occult traditions but only as it was related to the Druids and some of there musical instruments. <br>" The Piper " is an old story. Not much different than Confuscious or Aesop came up with.</span>

Then he says stuff that is kind of a slam aobut the women he was with at the time. How she thought she could get everything she wanted without ever giving anything in return. And then she decides she wants the stairway to heaven because she can get anything she wants, but when she gets to the stairway to heaven she doesnt know anything she is clueless.

         <span class="commentext">There IS a backwards message in Stairway to Heaven. First, write down every 6th letter from the lyrics. Now, assign each letter a number, a=1, b=2, c=3 (a classic Willie Dixon algorithm). Take the numbers in sets of 6, adding the first five and dividing by the 6th. Now add all those numbers up. If you change the font to 'Dingbats', it will now read 'Boobless in the toolshed'. Nuff said.</span>

         <span class="commentext">There is a lot of ignorance out there! While I only have an theory regarding the backward masking I think it is a good one. I have heard the recording and believe that it talks about Satan. Now my theory: Page was instrumental in engineering the recordings on many Zep albums, the song " When the Levee Breaks" has a harmonica solo recorded backward added to the song and that is fact, Page was clearly into the occult, final conclusion... Page added the backward masking without the other band members knowledge and while Plant would never admit to its existence he knows its on there and that is why he doesn't really like to play the song anymore.</span>

I have TSRTS on vynal "IT IS LIVE" i spun that backwards with my finger and it said the satanic message. I believe that this was not patched people. I am only 15 so you people can think what you want though. Its weird because the song is very satanic if you kow the true meaning... and many people call Led Zeppelin 4 ZOSO after Pages symbol. When in fact his symbol has a very satanic meaning. The Z is for jimmy's sun sign Capricorn... and OSO means 666. I have the reason but im to tired to type it out for ya all.

Plant according to this understanding of 'stairway to heaven' is trying to say that its never too late to change the road your on and take the stairway to heaven. <br><br>Possibly the backmasking and the actual song is representing the two roads talked about in this song. 1 being the worship of satan, the other (i suppose) the other maybe resisting satanism. <br><br>^^ not sure if all my stuff has been said already (can't be bothered to read all the stuff above).

         <span class="commentext">After reading all of the speculation on Stairway, I'll offer my 2 cents. I am 43, been listening to Zepp(THE GREATEST BAND EVER) since 1970. I've ruined several copies of LZ4 on turntables trying to hear the backward masking. Being a Radio DJ for the last 20 years in rock radio and having this conversation several times. I will ALWAYS say, the backwards thing DOES NOT EXIST. Zepps Aura amd Mystique lives on for a reason. Music and their Passion for it. The cosmos came together for 4 Awesome Musical talents and will live Forever. Period. Nothing we say as mere mortals(Christian or not) matters. History such as Zeppelins will never be duplicated. Nuff Said on that. A couple of shots though----As much as I love Zep--Stairway is not their best. No way-No How. The guitar solo was not pieced together. The genius of if was the fact that it was done as a 1 time take. That's talent and gift coinciding as a solid unit to show us mere mortals what can be achieved. I suggest we all enjoy the Extremely awesome Zeppelin catalogue and one more thing--if I ever met Jimmy Page- I would show him the respect he deserves and kneel at the feet of TRUE BRITSH ROYALTY. Remember this and live long lives everyone----Though the course may change sometimes--Rivers always reach the Sea. Have a Nice Day.</span>

         <span class="commentext">I was so intrigued by the idea of messages in a song when played backwards that I actually did it myself. What I found was that Led Zeppelin's Stairway to heaven DOES have messages in it. And more than one. Using an audio MP3 ripper called Wave Creator 3; I flipped the song and played it backwards. Simply using the rewind button is too fast, obviously. If you cut out the background noise and reduce the static, and of course; listen with devotion, (I used headphones for optimal perception....but it did freak me out) you will hear definite phrases. I was able to distinguish messages throughout the entire song, not just places. At the very end of the song, which becomes the beginning, it says "plaaaaay backwards...hear words sung" and then goes on continuously. I will admitt that some parts required multiple listenings to distinguish phrases, nevertheless, I was shocked to find myself with a complete set of lyrics in reverse.I do beleive that The Stairway to Heaven is an exceptional song and even the knowledge of thopse alternative lyrics do not keep me from enjoying it.

When we hear a song it's the same thing and that is why music is so great. TO one person they may see the devil inuendos and to another there is none.

         <span class="commentext">Okay, I have something to tell all of you... My friend has a Stairway to Heaven live version. He reversed it and we listened. <br><br>It's coincidence. It was hard to understand with the irritating audience screams and whatnot but we heard the message they apparently put in the studio version.<br><br>If you have a recorder at home, say the lyrics, then reverse. You'll hear the message somewhat. <br><br>It's kind of like Another One Bites the Dust by Queen. "It's fun to smoke marijuna" was supposively put into the song when played backwards but it just sounds like so when you reverse yourself speaking the words "another one bites the dust".</span>

         <span class="commentext">I loved STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN from first listen, I have to say iv gotten bored of it but I still listen to it from time to time and there is no doubt the lyrics and the guitair and everyhting is just genius. As for the satanic messages they are there but if Plant says he didn't mean to put them in I think we should take that as gospel Im sure if they wanted to talk about Satan they would just say it. Plus, it doesnt support Satan it says 'There was a little tool shed where he made us suffer'. That doesnt really support Satan at all. It is always nice to think there is more to a song this amazing. Especially as Plant said himself 'The penicil seemed to write itself'. Also the lyrics forwards are pretty random 'its just a spring clean for the May Queen' So weather its ghosts or just coincidence Im pretty sure they did not intentionally put in Satanic messages, Iv listened to the song loads and im no closer to worshipping Satan! <br><br>As for the meaning they have said it doesnt really have a meaning, at first I really didn't want to hear that, I wanted it to have a really deep meaning but really if it did it probably wouldnt be anything like mine so Id just be dissappointed. The song is just a series of image envoking lyrics and its brilliant.</span>

         <span class="commentext">To "- L, Fayetteville, AR "<br><br>You where stating that "This (pictured in the cover) man is the man represented as death on tarrot cards." This is totally wrong it represents "The Hermit" which is a symbol in many religions for a sage that seeks the loneliness, like Jesus Christ, Muhammed and Sidderharta Gautama did when they searched for higher meaning in the life and became prophets or "illuminated". <br><br>He just leave this world to be alone for meditation. The history of early christianity are filled with stories of hollow men that became Hermits in Syria and the "holly land" and also the hindu religions are filled with stories of holy men that choose to leave this world for meditation and serch for higher meaning. How "satanic" can this be?<br><br>The light "The Hermit" are bearing is just a symbol of enlightenment and wisdom he have reached trough his lonesome search for the truth. <br><br>The piper, have of course nothing to do with "satanism", but was first a reference to the greek god of the woods wich played beautifully on his flute:<br><br>The attributes or symbols associated with Pan are woods, pastures, and the syrinx -- a flute. Pan is depicted with goat's feet and two horns, and wearing a lynx-pelt. Many a british romantic poets like P.B. Shelley, Byron, William Blake, etc, etc uses the "piper" as references to the "god of woods" wichy by no means has any thing to do with "satanism".<br><br>And who is "Tha May Qeen"? Perhaps Queen Marie-JosÃ? of Italy (b.1907)?<br><br>Surprising, non-conformist, original and above all royal. Her Majesty Queen Marie-JosÃ? of Italy has not changed. Installed for some years now at her villa in Cuernavaca, Mexico, the former Italian sovereign demonstrates today the same curiosity that has characterized her throughout life. Her white villa and the surrounding garden, vibrant with bougainvilleas and exotic vegetation, are filled with charm.<br><br>http://www.eurohistory.com/marjose.html</span>

         <span class="commentext">If all of the posts by people posting the BS rumors they "heard" or "read" somewhere were removed, this page would be 1/10 its current ridiculously bloated size. I just read through this entire thing and I have seen so many idiots posting completely erroneous information as fact. They believe it because someone told them, and that's that. Of course, their recollection of what was said is less than accurate (and usually just plain wrong) So before I point out a few of the more hilarious fact butcherings, I beg of ALL of you, not just here, -ANYWHERE- to follow this common-sense rule. UNTIL YOU CAN VERIFY SOMETHING TO BE FACTUAL BASED ON YOUR PERSONAL RESEARCH *AND* CORROBORATION OF ALLEGED FACTS FROM *MULTIPLE REPUTABLE SOURCES* DO NOT PRESUME TO BE SOME KIND OF AUTHORITY POSTING INFO TO GET ATTENTION OR STRENGTHEN YOUR POINT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR CRAP YOU "HEARD OR READ SOMEWHERE" <br><br>Until the tidbit of info you kno is either a verified fact, or likely fact based on multiple (preferably redundant) reputable sources, you're only spreading rumors, and in this case, misinformed, uninformed, ignorant and just plain stupid ones. So, without further ado...<br><br>L, Robert Plant did not buy Aleister Crowley's house. Jimmy Page did. This wasn't some big satanic church. It was one of numerous Crowley residences. Jimmy bought it because a) he liked the architecture, location, and because the rumors surrounding it scared off people that would have otherwise snooped around. Ask any celebrity, the less of that they can get, the happier they are. b) Jimmy thought the latent natural energies, mood and aura still lingering there from its previous owner would make it a good place to songwrite. And as any good songwriter knows, ambient mood is critical to helping the creative process. <br><br>Various - Neither Robert Plant *nor* Jimmy Page were Satanic priests. Nor were they into satanism, per se. Robert was actually more intrigued in Native American spirituality and Celtic Mythology than the occult. (hence his son's name Karac- loosely Celtic word for Celtic soldier, I believe) In earlier years, Robert had a fascination with in occult/pagan arts, just like anyone else would. His exposure was limited to conversations with Page and the band, and as casual observer during some of Page's studies into various occult practices. Think about it. You're in a band. You spend most of your time away from home with these people. You have lots of down time. You get bored. However, Plant was frequently quoted as saying that he found Jimmy's occult dabblings "a little creepy" and became more opposed to them the more bad luck visited the band. After tragedy after tragedy, they were all tired, hurt and full of grief. Plant asked Page to basically chill out on the occult stuff. Not because he believed it was the cause of the misfortune, but merely because after so many tragedies, better not to push their luck any more than they had to. That's not satanism, that's Superstition. <br><br>I suspect a lot of the misinformation comes from these popular (yet incredibly stupid) assumptions.<br><br>1. Occult = Satanic. If you study or dabble in the occult, you are a satanist. Wrong. Go look up the definition. Apples/Oranges. Occult = Of, relating to, or dealing with supernatural influences, agencies, or phenomena. That is a very generalized definition, but nowhere in any of the definition I've seen is Satan, Lucifer, The Dark One *whatever* ever mentioned. Learn what the terms mean that you people fling around so confidently, before you misinform, and make yourselves look like complete morons in the process. <br><br>2. Backward masking lyrics in a song is ALWAYS done by a satanic band trying to sing the praises of Satan. - Wrong. And once again, learn your terms. What you hear in Stairway to Heaven is a REVERSE SPEECH phenomenon. Where what you say, played in reverse, sounds like something else.<br><br>Backward masking is not a tool of the devil. It's an old studio trick where you record a track (Track A), then basically either dub in another track (Track B). There's 2 ways to do that. One, Track A is played forward while Track B is played backward, and recorded that way onto a new track, (Track C) which is a mix of forward-playing Track A and backward-playing Track B. The second way is the exact opposite. Track A is played backward and a new clip is recorded Track B, and mixed to new Track C. It's the same thing, just differing in which track is flipped. The thing about this process though, is that anyone with even modest hearing WILL clearly hear this backward part as gibberish on the final mixed track. Inside the mix, you will catch that unmistakable sound of something being played backward that everyone has heard before in some context. Thus, for people wishing to "hide" a message in a recording. Backward masking is a really stupid way of doing it, since it's so noticeable. <br><br>People are so quick to attach nefarious intentions to backwards messages in recordings, but you only hear about the wildly blown-out-of-proportion Satan crap. What's overlooked on the evening news is that for a lot of these early artists &amp; bands, they were continually exploring new technology and trying new things. Many had never had access to such (then) state-of-the-art recording gear. Trying to see what all it can do is a natural curiosity of any sound engineer. Plus, many bands wanted to put messages in to either get crucial publicity and sell more records, or leave a little something as a "thank you" to their most devoted fans. And, in the case of one Pink Floyd song, Boredom, or to merely make fun of the entire debacle. "Congratulations. You have found the secret message". I can't remember the song that's in, but its well-known, and this example was done by mixing a quiet track of Roger Waters speaking the aforementioned line into a studio master tape which was being played backwards. <br><br>I think it's stupid to assume that there are all these major bands of the last 50 years deliberately embedding messages in their music with the intent of mentioning Satan, much less praising him. Of those few that did, a good percentage also released the rumor of such messages with their album to create controversy, and as a result, publicity. Why? cos they knew what they were relasing was such a pile of crap, it needed a controversy to sell. Anyone who doesn't believe stuff like that happens, no only doesn't know a damn thing about the music business, they're also not very grounded in reality, either. <br><br>Another thing: And this one makes me both furious and a little ashamed to be an American. To the girl who was mentioning the 'altered' pronunciation Plant used on the lines in question. Among the many amusing things she said, she also said this: "I've never even HEARD the word "Hedgerow" used, much less with a "bustle"!" And she used that, along with the curious pronunciation of Plant's words as an arument that he was trying to form the backward message by adjusting the pronouncement, accent, tibmre, etc.. of his *real* vocals.. To her I ask.. ARE YOU FREAKING HIGH?!! God, I live in a country of idiots. This chick obviously didn't know that Plant, just like the rest of the damn band, was BRITISH. No, you probably *won't EVER* hear the word "Hedgerow" spoken in Eula Mae's Kwik Stop &amp; Feed in Lard-Ass Creek, West Virginny. But hop "across the pond" and go to that country 76% of US High School Seniors in 2001 couldn't find on a map, and someone will be GLAD to show you what a frickin' hedgerow is!!<br><br>AND, for those of you who said Stairway to Heaven wasn't the all-time most played song, umm.. Please check your facts again. THIS time with your head *outside* of your ass. (one guy even said it wasn't even in the top 100.. wtf?! Kids, that is a prime example of why crack is a Bad Thing.) I don't recall radio ever being limited solely to the freaking USA. Believe it or not, there are other industrialized nations out there (the ones 85% of us can't find on maps). The statistic I do believe was taking into account worldwide radio play. American-only? Who knows? You can't define what constitutes an American station. Like, what about English-speaking military radio for the troops in Europe? or, stations in the Virgin Islands. They're our territories, so, why not them too? You can't accurately report that. Yes, if you limit it to the 50 US states, in recent years, that damn Righteous Brothers cover has taken over. But when the stat that everyone knows was released, it was before Top Gun and everything else that kept that song going strong. Plus, just *try* to find a station in the last 10 years that will play Stairway in its entirety. If you do, try to get them to play it outside of the hours of 11pm-6am. It's damn near impossible. Too long, and they have to pay a premium in royalties because the song is longer than ~6 minutes. So, it's only natural that over time a smooth, radio-friendly ~3 minute love song that is always pulled out of the grave and stuck in movies, ads, and whatnot would take over the throne held by any 8minute hard rock controversy.. <br><br>All in all, this entire thread is just a sad example of a lot of people trying to be self-important to the point of blabbing what they hear, whether it has any validity or not. They do so and drown out the legitimate fan discussion of what so many consider to be a classic, if not a mainstay of rock 'n roll. And we, the ever faithful (to Music and the freedom to make it any way you damn well please - NOT to Satan, mind you) try to battle these legions of idiot know-it-alls who base their entire opinion on *maybe* hearing the song once (but minus the attention span to listen to over 30 seconds) that Flash tool to play Stairway forward and backward (with handy lyrics before your eyes to influence what you ultimately hear) And the randomly absorbed, fuzzy remembrances of those "Hey, guess what I heard?!" drinking stories of years past. <br><br>And yeah, the history, artistry and musicianship that Stairway was all about does get trampled in this neverending cacophony. And that's the real shame of it. Yet, by the very fact that the song's still being debated here, years since it's birth, is evidence enough that no matter what your opinion on the reverse speech phenomena throughout the song, magic definitely exists within it, no matter which way it floats you boat to play it. <br><br>Thanks for enduring my rant. Please direct any subsequent flames to ME. Don't bother this already overcrowded forum with 'em. Corrections, always welcomed. In a mind dump this big, there are no doubt quite a few. <br><br>-Kelani Z</span>

         <span class="commentext">Several of you are asking what is "May Queen"? "May Queen" is a poem written by Aleister Crowley, who is also the author of The Book of the Law (of Satan), whose house Robert Plant purchased. Also, the picture of the lady climbing towards the top of the hill towards a man is interesting. This man is the man represented as death on tarrot cards. The piper is a reference to satan and "your head is humming" is a reference to an altered state of mind in which satan speaks to you. "Your head is humming and it won't go incase you don't know, the piper's (satan) calling you to join him. Dear lady can you hear the wind blow (piper's flutes--satan) and did you know, your stairway lies on the whispering wind (satan's path)". This song may mean nothing to lots of listeners, but the song has references to satan and to hell from the writers-and their motive within the song is what matters.</span>

         <span class="commentext">I can't believe people are still stuck up upon the notion that stairway to heaven contains some intentional satanic messages if played backwards and the lyrics were intentionally written that way by Robert and Jimmy. Yes, if you do play the song backwards, it sound like plant is saying something about the devil, but it's just a coincidence. There are a lot of songs that give some sort of messages when played backwards; like Britney Spears ' Hit me baby one more time, John Lennon ' Imagine, Eminem ' My name is', Queen ' Another one bites the dust, Etc. This is nothing but a coincidence. Some people feel that this is too much of a coincidence and the chances of a coincidence is one in millions, if you consider there have been hundreds of millions of songs written in every possible language in the last fifty years, probability wise, there have to be some songs that sound different when played backwards. Stairway to heaven is a great song and people should not try to destroy it by some weird coincidence.</span>

         <span class="commentext">If you want to know the true meaning of the song read the lyrics. Over half the things they talk about include the devil and hell. They even talk about the backward messages that are in the song, IN THE LYRICS!!!! part of the lyrics of the song say "your head is humming and it won't go because you don't know the piper's calling you to join him." They are talking about your subconscious, your brain knows what the words are forward but your subconscious knows what the words say backward, but you don't know only your subconscious knows. The piper in this phrase is the devil, and the backward messages that only your subconscious knows what there saying, are santanic. Which means that the messages aren't just an accident they are there on purpose. There is another phrase in the song "And if you listen very hard the tune will come to you at last." Also supports my theory. Some people wonder why they would do something like this the reason is they worshiped satan. On one of the pictures on their CD that has The Stairway to Heaven, the picture has a man holding a lantern that has the satanic star in it. The same picture also has a small goat in the bottom left corner, they sacrifice goats at satanic masses. Next to the goat there is a man looking up at the priest, this is jesus, he's looking up at the man because the man is satan, and the picture is trying to show satan as being above jesus.</span>

         <span class="commentext">Just as an added comment, I'd like to say that yes, I do believe the "satanic messages" were interntionaly put in, but do I care? No. I think whoever figured this out has too much time on their hands. Secondly, it's not necissarily satanic "messages". It's simply words that have to do with satan. it could be any message depending on how you interpret it. But if it were a message, I'd say the point is that destiny can be backwards/forwards (hence the 'messages'), negative/positive, dark/light, hell/heaven, etc. etc. etc. I personally just want to listen to the song rather than analyze it like a specimen in a bottle. If any of you need to know how to listen to a song, there might me a print-out instruction booklet somewhere on the internet. Good luck with that.</span>

Secondly let's say Plant and/or Page did sell their souls to get their hands on "Stairway To Heaven", well... the damage is done might as well enjoy the song. I'm sure you can find some Satanic messages even in Jessica Simpson's songs. When your mind gets obsessed with something, you will find it everywhere. Lastly, I worship Led Zeppelin.</span>

If I didn't know what i was supposed to hear i woulndt have realised that i was listening to those messages so i think it was just my brain creating what i was supposed to hear because when i listened to the song i used to think that part of the song said "if there is a muscle in your head youll move along now" and i would hear that when i would play the song until i read the lyrics and saw that it says "if theres a bustle in your hedgerow dont be alarmed now" my brain was creating it because it sounded like it just like the satanic messages backwards</span>

         <span class="commentext">Just take the song for what it is, forwards, or backwards. Yes, it is true, backwards some parts sounds like they are talking about satan, great, whether it was intentionaly or not is unknown to the general public. This song is a pretty good song, but it is very overrated compared to their other works, though the lyrics are very good, and if the backwards message was intentional, then cheers to that, thats pretty good if the words make sense forwards and backwards.</span>

If this song is about cheating your way into heaven, this line might be referring to the company cheeting him cuz the washer + drier didn't work.

         <span class="commentext">Stairway to heaven is more than it seems, Jimmy page came up with song at the crowly mansion, while, at the same time robert plant was 1000 miles away and began to write the lyrics, as soon as page finished robert called him and told him he had lyrics for a new song. When they met the song and lyrics mysteriously fit creating stairway to heaven. I beleive that page and plant had been sent this song by satan. Page did black magic and put a hex on led zeppelin to be successful, he claimed himself to be a wizard for the press in the 70's and plant admited to being afraid of page for a time because of his involvement with the occult. Stairway to heaven speaks of how people waste their life away on money and forget that there is a god in heaven and money wont get you there. They stairway to heaven the lady is buying is a stairway to hell by buying it with selling her soul to satan as did jimmy page and robert plant. The piper in the song refers to satan, the deceiver, who lures you away from god with music and leads you to doom, just like the pied piper and the rats, Satan is calling you to join him to lead you to reason, which is his reason to have you do what thou wilt. Those who stand long in the end will start a new day, a day of suffering in hell for all eternity for rejecting god. Satan wont go down alone. He'll take as many of us as he can. The may queen is a poem by crowley, who is the founder of the church of satan. If you start to see the light this poem will bring you back to the dark. Dear people can you hear the wind blow and did you know our stairway lies on the whispering wind. Its whispered that if you call satan he will come to you. The piper walks on the whispering wind as does the lady. The stairway in the picture she walks up doesnt lead to light but to a dark figure which is the hermit from the death tarot card. There are two paths you can go by. The path to heaven or hell. And in the longrun you can repent from your evil ways and turn to light or you can reject it and go to the dark with satan and go to hell and suffer for all eternity. As we wind on down that dark road, shadows taller and ruling our souls we will see people we know like the lady, she poses as light but is really dark. And that you can trade your soul for gold like she did. And if you listen and look for satan and his tune, you WILL find it. And you will be with satan once and for all once you hand over your soul. When all is one and one is all. You will be a rock with a hardened heart not able to return to the light, for you reject god by selling yourself. You will be a rock and cant roll to the other path. And you will have bought a stairway to heaven. That's what i really honestly thing that stairway to heven is about. You can laugh at me but I'm the biggest zep fan and i have researched and i go to church so i hear the bible and what it says and this is what i have compiled.</span>

Satanic and LOTR messages aside, if you listen to the How the West Was Won version of Stairway, when Plant sings "and the voices of those who stand looking" he follows the lyric with an address to the audience of "that's you" which leads me to believe that the entire verse about "looking to the west", though deffinitely a LOTR refference, may also be a metaphor for going on tour.

         <span class="commentext">Stairway to Heaven: Greatest Christian allegory ever written, however unintentionally. Assuming the backmasking is there, this metaphor for Christianity is evident by the concept, and the content of the song. The idea of not being able to buy your way to heaven, or happiness, is evident, as well as the idea of "two roads" by which to travel. Looking at this from a Christian point of view, the line "yes there are two paths you can go on, but, in the long run, there's still time to change the road you're on" is a refference to the fact that it is never too late to repent. Also, the lyric "if there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed" which many of you feel is out of place, could very easily be a call to not get discouraged when things go wrong (the mayqueen crap i have NO idea what that's about). My biggest argument, however, for the divine intervention that may have resulted in the writing of this song lies in my belief that the back masking is not only there, but completely intentional, be it by Plant, or some...one...else, for it expresses one of the most important aspects of believing in the Christian God-- the idea of freewill, and being able to choose what, or whom, you believe in. It is probably no coincidence that the dark, 'evil influenced' message is so comparitivly creepy and unnerving to the uplifting and triumphant nature of the song when played correctly. So assuming that there is a satanic message on the underbelly of the greatest song ever written, it fits only too well, for there can not be light without darkness. All of this, to me, just intesifies my belief that Rock N'Roll is not the Devil's music, it is the music of God, and, more specifically, if the Bible had a soundtrack, it'd be Zeppelin. Why else would the greatest Christian Allegory be expressed through the greatest song from the greatest band ever? <br>Now, i'm not trying to preach, and i'm not saying Plant was doing this on purpose. You're free to disagree with me, and believe what ever you want; you have your own opinion.<br> I Also, I think Jesus was really pissed that he wasn't Elvis.</span>

I beleived that I knew what I had heard, but I was wrong. <br><br>2. Plant one said, and I quote: "I was too druged up to remember what it was about, make your own mind up" If he were trying to spread the word about satanism, don't you think he might have been a little more enigmatic and saidd somthing like; "The whole world is Backwards" or somthing like that?</span>

You'll hear a song that's almost as great as "Stairway to Heaven." Go home and try it. I really don't believe that Satanic messages are hidden in the song backwards, but even if they are, it is only the bands beliefs. No where in the alleged messages does it tell people that the devil will rule the world, conquer God, or even trying to convince people to convert to be a Satanist. If anything it sounds more like they made a mistake and praised satan and now they are trying to fight their way back to God. But what I strongly recommend to people is to listen to the song forwards, and nothing but.</span>

It was probably Lord of the Rings, personal experiences or the bible. I would say it wasn't the devil or Jimmy Pages cult friend or whatever.

Stairway to Heaven is the one of the best songs ever written by the best band ever. The lyrics are amzing and the music is too. It took a lot of talent just to right this song forward, and I don't think Plant would have taken the time to add backwards stuff to such a good song. And for the people who still believe the backmasking real, it would be in in no way satanic. Also, someone earlier wrote the small Christian Minority Hates it. I am a christian, the grandson of a pastor, i go to church twice a week and I strongly believe in Jesus. I am even considering become a pastor when I get older. And i think Stairway to Heaven is one of the greatest songs ever and i know a lot of people from my church and school who are devoted Christians and think Led Zeppelin is the coolest band ever.

The story of the Piper is a very old German legend. Basically it is about mid 1200's in a german town that is over-run with rats. The piper comes and plays his flute and all the rats run out of the town. He was supposed to get paid for this, but didn't, so soon after he lead 130 children into a forest by playing his flute and they were never seen again. A popular theory of the piper is that he is the DEVIL HIMSELF. And it also ties in with the flute playing at the begining of the song. If you don't believe me type "The History of the Piper" in google search. AND it is no secret that Led Zeppelin is known to be satanic. A awesome song instrumentally though.</span>

And secondly, most of the people who claim that certain songs contain subliminal messages are those "religious fanatics." To them I say: take a look at some of the passages in the bible...I'm sure if you read them backwards they too will have subliminal messages such as: "Here's to my sweet Satan. May Satan rule all. Satan is the only God," or other such NONSENSE!!! Anything can have a hidden message if you look hard enough. And as for some unknown power moving Robert Plant's hand to write the lyrics....ever hear of a "muse?!" Muses' are angels not DEMONS! And besides...there is no such thing as Satan anyway. Satan is simply a fallen angel that has NO POWER compared to God. Satan is just an excuse people use for commiting the sins of gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, and lust.</span>

The references here are much more obscure than those of songs like "Ramble On" and "Misty Mountain Hop" and include the lines about a "bustle in your hedgerow", "rings of smoke through the trees", and "there's a feeling I get when I look to the West."
