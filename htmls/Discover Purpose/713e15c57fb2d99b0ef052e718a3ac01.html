            <p>Solara Amour- Feng Shui &amp; House Healing. Solara Amour is a Space Clearing specialist helping people to transform their lives by transforming their living space. She has been a student of alternative healing modalities (physical, emotional and spiritual) for 25 years, including Feng Shui, 2nd Reiki, Rebirthing, and Yuen Energetics. My life’s path has led me to working with people in their homes. I help them to remove the unnecessary things that no longer define who they are now. We talk about who they are, what their possessions currently mean to them, and what they really want and need to support them both now and in the future.

            <p>From the time I was little, I’d have dreams that would occasionally come true. In August of 1996 after a series of very powerful healing sessions with Dr. Eric Scott Pearl, I came home one night to have an out-of-body experience during which I re-entered my body so hard it threw me forward in bed. From that moment on, things got “interesting”. I started hearing voices, having visions, and just knew things I shouldn’t know. I studied channeling with Shawn Randall to learn how to better handle the energies that were coming to me spontaneously. I got my professional jump start in New Mexico in the spring of 2006 when I worked at my first psychic faire in Albuquerque.<br> website <a href="http://www.spiritbridge.net">www.spiritbridge.net</a>&nbsp; and phone (323) 481-5888.</p>

One of the ways she does this is by allowing some very powerful and loving beings to use her voice and her body to communicate with people and help them heal what they need. These beings show up as ascended masters. They have a sweet kindness and playfulness – so that everything in life is play, even when it’s serious, and divine jokes are all around, and laughter is healing and holy. Some people refer to this work as ‘supernatural coaching’. The joyful nature of the energy combined with the clarity and accuracy of the information conveyed continue to provide relief and healing to clients.

            <p>Radiant Journeys-Innovative Healing”&nbsp; From the age of 4, I remember “seeing” angels and people who were no longer “alive” in their physical bodies and could always “feel” if people were nice, angry, sad or unsafe. By the age of 13, I was receiving messages from my angel guides and helping people as they “crossed” over to communicate with those left behind. After my father passed away in 2002, my healing process led me to discover the powerful aura imaging system that utilized Bio-feedback. Since then I experienced an expansion of my intuition that has continued to evolve and serve people stuck or lost on their personal journeys through life.&nbsp; Sandi can be reached at <a href="http://www.radiantjourneys.com">www.radiantjourneys.com</a>&nbsp; or tel: 360.904.7888</p>

            <p>Marie Friend was born and raised in England. From an early age she attended Spiritualist Churches, so mediumship and paranormal events became a part of her formative years. However, it was not until she reached mid-life that she became convinced of reincarnation. She discovered her ability to ‘tune into’ other peoples’ past lives. She learnt the meaning of Karma; “What ye sow, also ye will reap”. She believes she has been given the gift of vision in order to help people understand that Karmic patterns are repeated in order to assist in the growth of the Spirit, and to follow the Soul’s path in this life time. Through showing people their past, she is able to help them with their future. e-mail: <a href="mailto:MarieJFriend@Yahoo.com">MarieJFriend@Yahoo.com</a></p>

            <p>DO ANIMALS HAVE SOULS? What is a mortal animal body? What is a soul? How do their natures, interests and goals differ and why? How would one behave in the absence of the other? After answering these questions we will look at eighteen ways a soul might obviously express itself within a body. Also covered will be a comparison of religious and metaphysical traditions on the subject and status of animals and animal soul life. A “must hear” for animal lovers and students of the spirit.

            <p>A medium from Scotland.&nbsp; As a child, my intuition was always strong, but my gift lay dormant for years. As an adult, I started to explore my potential; to see if I really could work with the Spirit world. I began my journey when I heard about Arthur Findlay Spiritualist College in England, and enrolled for the beginner’s course in Mediumship. That week forever changed my way of looking at life and death. I found that I could receive messages from those who had crossed over and give those messages to people I had never met. In addition, the discipline of mind I learned through meditation was astounding. Sitting in the Power, a method of meditation where one deeply connects with Spirit, helped me get clearer messages and to further understand this exciting process. I now reach out to others in need of comfort and validation that their loved ones are alive and well on the Other Side.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.jimhyndman.com/">http://www.jimhyndman.com/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.spiritualistassociation.org.uk/MediumsTherapists.html">http://www.spiritualistassociation.org.uk/MediumsTherapists.html</a></p>

            <p>Devra has been a practicing intuitive counselor for over 28 years. With her unique connection with Arch Angel Michael that began at the age of 6, she gets a multidimensional view of what is happening on all the dimensions of someone’s life. Devra and Michael read your energies, guides, spirits, and occasionally your loved ones who have passed over. With this approach your reading shifts as you shift. The moment you change what you are thinking the dimension of the reading changes, too. She hears the words from Michael and your assistants and relays them directly to you. <a href="http://readingsbydevra.com">http://readingsbydevra.com</a></p>

            <p>Sharon and Gary create a Dynamic Team. Their male and female energies synergistically combine in deeply felt heart activations and transformative healing sessions. They work together to activate the Heart Center and open numerous energy channels. Sharon gets her logical mind out of the way and surrenders to Spirit which guides her moment by moment. In a healing, Sharon may be supplying or removing energy, using various sounds and merging in consciousness. During merging she can bring up unconscious beliefs and/or buried emotions that are creating energetic disturbances in the client’s energy field and restoring harmony with new awareness. Gary utilizes his high frequency energy, claircognizance, and consciousness to create a safe place for deep transformation on all levels. These experiences open you to higher energy, greater vitality and empowerment. Often clients awaken to their Spiritual Gifts or understanding of their Higher Purpose leading to feelings of inner peace, joy and fulfillment.

            <p>Sarah Lambert is a Licensed Massage Therapist and Psychic Intuitive. She is guided by a strong intuition to use her hands for healing. She became proficient in many forms of bodywork, combining them into a distinctly unique and effective massage style.&nbsp; In January 2009 she had a psychic awakening. This integrated itself immediately with her bodywork, creating a new level of conscious body/spirit healing. Working through clothing, Sarah will “read” the body, explaining the Higher messages of physical experiences, and providing guidance on one’s life journey. As she speaks, her hands serve to communicate these messages on both physical and energetic levels, ensuring your body’s integration of the psychic guidance. Because her work is primarily about connecting the spirit messages as they manifest in the body, she will be leading everyone in a meditation to check in with their bodies, where they feel pain, and what memories or emotions come with this. She will then speak to individuals about their physical pain and its higher message.&nbsp; Visit her web site, <a href="http://www.bodyinsights.com">http://www.bodyinsights.com</a></p>

In addition to doing phone readings for clients all over the country, Areanne produces two half-hour channeling shows each month for the local cable access channels 11 and 21 on Comcast.

            <p>Dave Markowitz is the author of <strong><em>Self-Care for the Self-Aware: A Guide for Highly Sensitive People, Empaths, Intuitives, and Healers.</em></strong> He is a medical intuitive who has helped thousands on their journey toward wholeness! After years of denying his empathic abilities, his slap-in-the-face moment was when he got drunk without drinking any alcohol. Dave then began attracting clients who’d done lots of spiritual work but hadn’t seen improvements using traditional, alternative, or complementary modalities. He was able to intuit that his client’s pains and illness weren’t their own; that their empathic abilities made them an “energetic sponge!” Dave knew he could “squeeze” the “sponge” but also knew that without addressing the underlying causes, all pains and illness would be eventually recreated. He then intuited a 5-step process that helps sensitives to permanently “give back” what isn’t theirs, and helps people to see their gifts as a blessing and not a curse.

Since the age of twelve she has been marked with the wounds of the crucifixion, and has hardly eaten or slept for over fifty years. He was reunited with her two years ago in Toronto, and returned with a remarkable video of Sister Susan relating her life history, and of her experience of the ‘pain’ period in which she bleeds, enters trance, speaks in tongues and offers prayers for healing. All proceeds Jim receives are donated to Sister Susan’s orphanage in India.&nbsp; Jim spent seven years travelling the world in search of places and people and mystery. He shares his experiences with healers and teachers through a unique program of slides and colorful stories.</p>

            <p>I believe that All is One and All is Now. After a spiritual awakening in 1988 my life became focused on one idea; that I could experience connectedness to source; in my body, in this time, right now, whatever the circumstances. I am continually expanding my understanding of what it means to stand in the waterfall of Spirit. It has led me through the healing and intuitive arts, into mystery school and now I am simply living the mystery. I am a medical intuitive and spiritual teacher. I know that people are already perfect, and my job is to assist them to reveal that perfection.<br> I live in Olympia, Washington and see clients there in-person and I am available for an appointment by phone. My healing meditation CD Sacred Temple and my book, Letters to Anna, Conversations with an Indigo Child are available on my website. <a href="http://www.cathypfeil.com">www.cathypfeil.com</a> tel: 360-459-5026</p>

           <div class="post-content"> 
            <p>Brad’s discovery of his gifts as a Psychic Medium arrived with the whack of a cosmic 2 x 4. It opened his third eye to the reality of what’s beyond that thin veil that separates us from the other side. He had been able to “see” the residuals of past life traumas for years, but never was really sure what to do with that ability. After being opened, he was faced with not only developing his skills, but integrating this new found reality with his Electrical Engineering background – a struggle he still faces daily. Along his path he’s been trained in Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), the Yuen Method of Chinese Energetic Medicine, Matrix Energetics, and Pranic Healing. He is an ordained Healing Minister, and holds a Washington State Massage Practitioner’s License. In the latter half of ’05, he found “his people” when he stumbled across the Harmony Grove Spiritualist Association in Southern California. His discovery of the Church of Alice has provided him a new opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals, and continue his path of spiritual enfoldment.</p>

            <p>Cynthia has a divine gift as a Telepathic Intermediary and Deep Channel Medium.” I am enveloped with love to inspire others to follow their destiny through messages of universal importance. Studies of the esoteric arts include aura viewing, past life regression, psychometry, transchanneling, telepathy and medical intuition. I am a Mentor and teacher of workshops and classes, and in turn studied with several teachers including Apryl Douglas, author of “Developing Your Psychic Abilities”.&nbsp; I have been interviewed on television and in print media, including Simply Spiritual and the New Connexion, Journal of Conscious Evolution.&nbsp; I utilize the energetic patterning by accessing the universal collective present within the grids and auric fields of all dimensional presence. As a telepathic intermediary I am honored with this unique gift in receiving information and communication to each individual including the Indigo/Psychic children of the World. Direction is provided involving their soul’s purpose; health; career; relationships; creative gifts; future endeavors; past lives; spirit guides; loved ones present and those that have moved on including their beloved pets.&nbsp; I channel the receiver’s guides referring to future and past events linked; seeing auric energy patterns and blockages, as well as revealing inner tools connected to a higher power. With an open heart of trust and deep gratitude, I am divinely guided in the process of assisting in raising the collective vibration, striving to make planetary healing a reality.”Phone: (503) 347 6766 web site: <a href="http://www.cynthiaslon9.com">www.cynthiaslon9.com</a>&nbsp; e-mail: cyns999(at)gmail.com</p>

Indeed it does when you know how to interpret a name. &nbsp;Her groundbreaking work has been so important that she has dedicated the majority of her time to development of the concept that each of us has a wonderful guidance system that is built into our birth name. We impress the one who is naming us what we wish to be called and thus name ourselves. Then we work with our name our entire life.

           </header> 
           <div class="post-content"> 
            <p>Recently at their church in Salem while doing “visioning board work” Rev. Richard Jackson and his wife Marie came to an understanding that their calling is&nbsp;to bring people together in community and provide them with an emotionally rich experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;With this inner revelation of definite purpose, Richard and Marie have remained open to any direction by Spirit that would move them in fulfilling this calling.</p> 
            <p>In Jan. of 2014 the duo established the Metaphysical Society of Silverton, a discussion group organized around a special speaker and a particular metaphysical topic.&nbsp; The response from Silverton has been quite good and we hope to continue these meetings into the New Year.</p>

Jackson was added to the Pastoral Team of H.O.M.E. Center Living New Thought Church and together with Marie has began private counseling work under the name of&nbsp;Chrysalis&nbsp;which&nbsp;engages Marie’s mediumistic gifts together with Richard’s own work of intuitive readings and this has proven to be a blessing both within their own faith community and beyond.</p> 
            <p>Marie is a wonderfully sensitive evidential medium and seems to really connect with those no longer in the body.&nbsp; Her messages are particular and significant.<br> The Jacksons’ H.O.M.E. Center website is<a href="http://%20homecenterhealing.com" target="_blank">&nbsp;homecenterhealing.com</a>&nbsp; where you will find information about their faith community and access to their internet radio shows (heard throughout the United States).</p>
