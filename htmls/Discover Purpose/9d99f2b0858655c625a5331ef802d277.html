   <p> Inspirational thoughts, motivational quotes, and wisdom from around the world </p>
  </center> 
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <center>
   A new thought each and every week
  </center> 
  <p> </p>
  <blockquote>
   Underlying these thoughts are my personal values and my personal philosophy which encompass difference and diversity, fun and friendship, optimism and openness, trust, tolerance and teamwork, creativity, learning and growth, a commitment to reason and critical thinking, an interest in other countries and cultures, and a willingness to embrace change and new experiences. 
   <p> If you share at least some of these principles, then you should find the following thoughts illuminating and, on occasions, hopefully even inspiring. One of my friends once called my circulation of Thought For The Week "a web of wisdom".</p>

Staff will have a large measure of autonomy to try and fail. Employees will be encouraged to challenge the status quo. Open communication and information-sharing with customers, staff and suppliers will encourage a flow of ideas. Teamwork and flexibility will be taken for granted."</b> <p> "Living On Thin Air" by Charles Leadbeater (1999) </p><p> </p></li>

Most new knowledge will be developed by synthetic intelligence and we will have to accept that we just do not understand some of it, while accepting the resultant benefits."</b> <p> "Technology Timeline - Towards Life In 2020" by BT futurologist Ian Pearson in "BT Technology Journal", No 1 2000 </p><p> </p></li>
