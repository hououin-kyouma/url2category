        <p>In life there are numerous people who truly deserve our gratitude. For, many have been the hands that have joined in moulding our present. The Indian scriptures remind us, '<em>Matru Devo Bhava, Pitru Devo Bhava, Acharya Devo Bhava</em>' - One owes respect to one's mother, father and teacher in the order mentioned; and above all God of course, for it says give respect by treating them like God. </p> 
        <p>Most of us individuals have ample opportunities to show gratitude to our parents. We live our entire life with them and have scope for filling their lives with joy for all they have done for us. But what about our teachers? We meet many of them through the journey of life. Some touch our lives in ways we cannot describe or even comprehend. Some do it so silently that years pass before we realise they did, like the fragrance of a rose garden that often comes to us only after we have walked past it.</p> 
       </div> 
       <div class="articlemaintext14"> 
        <p>Bhagawan would often insist we be grateful to God for all that He has given us. But why, one wonders! Doesn't God do whatever He does selflessly, then why does He seek our gratitude? </p> 
        <p>The answer is simple - gratitude is a noble virtue to possess, and Bhagawan wishes we all be virtuous enough to be grateful. Most of the inspiring teachers we encounter in life too neither had the time nor desire for our gratitude, but each one of you will agree that saying that thanks, even if it is in the silence of our hearts, makes us feel so warm and happy. </p> 
        <p><span class="paraboxtitlePink15">So, why not we express our love to those teachers on this occasion of Guru Poornima?</span> You do it the way it gives you joy - poem, audio message, a picture or just a few heartfelt words - we will share it with the rest of the world. </p> 
        <p>Who knows, after all your teacher might see your message and with a twinkle in his or her eye, and remember you with fondness. It could be anybody - your Bal Vikas guru, your swimming instructor, your kindergarten teacher or even someone you look up to as a teacher - but someone who has touched your life in a way that is very special and taught you an indelible lesson of life. Make your Guru Poornima special, by remembering that one special teacher.</p>

            <p align="left"> When the student is ready, the teacher appears... Buddhist proverb.&nbsp;</p> 
            <p> I was born as a student, I am student my whole life, for, the day we think I have studied all I needed, we stop progressing.&nbsp;</p> 
            <p> We are all indebted to our first guru, our mother, a bunch of 100 teachers. I thank her from the depth of my heart. &nbsp;My mother and father instilled human value in me. My father gave me discipline too. &nbsp;School and college teachers help me excel by believing in me. &nbsp;My brothers and sisters and their family's love care and support taught me many things and mould me in a better person. Some friends, and co-workers also &nbsp;played the role of teachers in my life.&nbsp;</p> 
            <p> I am very much thankful to&nbsp;&nbsp;Shri Pandurang Shastri Athavale who at "Swadhyay" taught essence of Bhagavad Gita and how to implement its teachings in daily life. He also taught to live like family with all members called "Swadhyayi". &nbsp;He inspired to do selfless service also.&nbsp;</p> 
            <p> I am grateful to&nbsp;our beloved&nbsp;Swami, &nbsp;the greatest &nbsp;Guru, teacher of all teachers, for giving me all the opportunities to learn from all the teachers mentioned above and other teachers in different forms including some&nbsp;objects (please refer poem below)&nbsp;and incidents. Computer, internet and books taught me too. How can I forget mistakes of mine and mistakes of others too? Mistakes are great teachers. &nbsp;I thank all my teachers and pray Swami to bless all of them.&nbsp;</p> 
            <p> Swami you made me worthy of receiving your grace form the whole Sai family and love care, guidance and support from Flushing Sai Center devotees in particular.&nbsp;<br> </p>

            <p align="JUSTIFY"><span lang="en-GB"><em><strong>Guru Balan was a living example of the teachings and messages of our beloved and as HE stated in the above quote. </strong></em></span><br> </p> 
            <p align="JUSTIFY"> <span lang="en-GB">Guru Balan has touched the lives of many people, especially his students. </span></p> 
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><span lang="en-GB"> But, without any doubt, the greatest talent of Guru Balan, as we all know, was his golden voice. His voice was a gift of God. He sang very well and it came from his heart. And it is this vibration from the heart which touched the hearts of so many.</span></p> 
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><span lang="en-GB"> Guru Balan was also a great musician. He used his harmonium to the best of his abilities and people were mesmerised by his skills. He gave life to his harmonium and his harmonium gave life to the devotees.</span></p> 
            <p lang="en-GB" align="JUSTIFY"> Without any doubt, he was an instrument of God. He was the chosen one. He was sent to us as a Messenger of God.</p> 
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><span lang="en-GB"> Another noteworthy aspect of Guru Balan was his ability to make each and everyone feel at ease in any context and any situation. The rich as well as the poor, the young as well as the old, the adults as well as the children were all happy in his presence. Furthermore, everyone respected him. It was as if he had the power to conquer every heart.</span><br> </p> 
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><span lang="en-GB"> What is very important to emphasize here is that Guru Balan always kept his smile despite the ups and downs of life. He had much to give to people. He was ready to share his knowledge without restrictions. He was ready to sacrifice everything for Sai Baba. He had vast tolerance, an ocean of love, of compassion, of patience. He was extremely kind, very generous, the list can be endless.</span></p> 
            <p lang="en-GB" align="JUSTIFY"> All his actions were selfless. He never expected anything in return. He was never after fame, name, money or political gains and material gains.</p> 
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><span lang="en-GB"> Guru Balan was not a rich man financially, but he was an extremely rich person spiritually. His good characteristics helped him to give rather than to receive, in the proper way a devotee should be, as taught by Sathya Sai Baba.</span></p> 
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><span lang="en-GB"> Guru Balan was not a sadhu, a swami or a great sage. He was an ordinary simple person. He was like any one of us. But he was special. He was God-sent.</span></p> 
            <p lang="en-GB" align="JUSTIFY"> There is a saying which goes like this “great people live in the minds of others, but good people live in the hearts of others”.</p> 
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><span lang="en-GB"> Guru Balan belonged to both categories. He was not only a great person but also a good person. He left his imprints in our minds and much more on our hearts.</span></p> 
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><span lang="en-GB"><em><strong> All that we can say </strong></em></span><span lang="en-GB"><em><strong>today is that, we thank Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba who sent us such a person in our country, who could bring us together on the spiritual path to guide us, to motivate us and to inspire us then, now and forever.</strong></em></span><br> </p> 
            <p lang="en-GB" align="JUSTIFY"> Let’s end on these lines of a famous poet who wrote:<br> </p> 
            <p lang="en-GB" align="JUSTIFY"> “<em><strong>Lives of great men remind us all that we can make our lives sublime and departing, leave behind us footprints on the sands of time”.</strong></em><br> </p>

Guru kripa qualifies us to the next stage of Shaastra Kripa. We learn to study contemplate on and practice the eternal teachings with the help of the Guru and thus engage ourselves in Shravana, Manana and Nidhi Dhyaasana. All these take us to the final stage of Eshwara Kripa when we become eligible to receive the grace of the Almighty. </span></p> 
            <p><span lang="en-GB">To be a generation on this Mother Earth, when the Avaathar decided to grace this planet by taking birth, to be fortunate enough to be in the Divine fold and enjoy the </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>Darshan</em></span><span lang="en-GB">, </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>Sparshan</em></span><span lang="en-GB"> and </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>Sambhaashan</em></span><span lang="en-GB"> of the Lord in human form, is in itself a great boon for all of us. Our beloved Bhagavan, relentlessly laboured during His earthly sojourn, to sow the seeds of </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>Atma</em></span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>Kripa</em></span><span lang="en-GB"> in us, by regularly addressing us as </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>Divyaatma</em></span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>Swaroopulara</em></span><span lang="en-GB">. He reminded us time again in every discourse of His that we are born in order to learn how not to be born again, driving home the point that we must unfailingly strive to realize our innate divinity. In the word GURU, Gu stands for </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>Gunaatheetha</em></span><span lang="en-GB"> [The one who is beyond the attributes] and Ru, for </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>Rupa</em></span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>Varjitha</em></span><span lang="en-GB"> [The Formless one]. Hence, the true Guru is the Lord Himself. We have had the greatest fortune of having the Lord Himself as our Guru, the Guru who declared ,”My Life is My Message.” and urged us to make our life His message. Thus Swami bestowed upon us the Guru Kripa. He taught us the nuances of the toughest </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>vedantha</em></span><span lang="en-GB"> and the scriptures of all the religions in the simplest and the most practical terms like ‘LOVE ALL, SERVE ALL “and “HELP EVER, HURT NEVER”, and thus showering upon us the </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>Shaastra</em></span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>kripa</em></span><span lang="en-GB">. As Revered Kasturiji said, “Bhagavan’s every word is a mantra, every phrase a sutra, every sentence a Gayathri and every speech an Upanishad.” By putting into practice His teachings in our day to day life, we can easily divinize every mundane mechanical activity of ours and qualify to earn the </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>Eshwara</em></span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB"><em>Kripa</em></span><span lang="en-GB"> –His grace. What greater fortune can we ask and aspire for in a life time?

            <p><span lang="en-GB">It is important to value the Master. But it is far more important to master His Values so that our life becomes His message.

            <p>When I hear the word “Guru”, the first thing that I remember is <em>Sai Ram</em>. My two eternal <em>Gurus, </em>Sai and Rama. Both, Bhagawan Baba and Lord Rama, have taught me the importance of the five human values, especially <em>Sathya </em>and <em>Dharma. </em>Baba has been my guide and guru. He has taught me everything in my life. I cannot express my gratitude to Swami in words. </p> 
            <p>Furthermore, ever since I was a child, I’ve always looked up to Lord Rama. I read the Ramayana over and over. I realize that Lord Rama has a major influence in my life. <br> </p> 
            <p>Lord Rama and his three brothers, in fact, correlate to the four Vedas, which are the road maps for the spiritual path. The first Veda, Rig Veda, is known to protect and nourish <em>yagnas </em>and<em> pujas. </em>Therefore, Lord Rama himself is the Rig Veda. <br> </p> 
            <p>Also, the epic Ramayana demonstrates the importance of <em>namasmarana. </em>I was very fortunate to have a great <em>Guru</em> who has helped me practice <em>namasmarana</em> through bhajans. Arthi Aunty was the first teacher who taught me how to sing bhajans. If it wasn’t for Arthi Aunty, I wouldn’t be able to sing bhajans or communicate with god. Furthermore, Gobinath Uncle first introduced me to Baba’s fold through <em>Balavikas </em>classes. He was my first <em>Balavikas</em> teacher. I am eternally grateful to Arthi Aunty and Gobinath Uncle for all they have done for me. </p> 
            <p>On this auspicious day of Guru Poornima, I offer my gratitude to my divine <em>Guru,</em> Bhagawan Sri Sathya Baba<em>, </em>Lord Rama, as well as Arthi Aunty and Gobinath Uncle. </p>

Be it little lessons in life, the lessons from the epics and scriptures or even the first lessons in the classroom, it was Swami who taught us. I still recollect that one day in the year 1990 when Swami walked into our classroom in the Sri Sathya Sai Primary School and had a basket of wax fruits. He taught us the names of each fruit... apple, banana, orange, grape, etc. and lovingly repeated while showing us each fruit. We were all so excited and happy seeing those colourful fruits. Then he joked saying those were wax fruits and that they shouldn’t be eaten :) As 5 year old kids we were all so thrilled that day and in fact all through the day we couldn’t stop looking at the fruit basket off and on!</p>

            <p>The <span lang="zxx"><u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism" target="_blank">Hindu</a></u></span> <span lang="zxx"><u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru-shishya_tradition" target="_blank">guru-shishya tradition</a></u></span> is the <span lang="zxx"><u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition" target="_blank">oral tradition</a></u></span> or religious doctrine or experiential wisdom transmitted from teacher to student - says the Wikipedia. My longing of many years to learn veda was fulfilled by swami when I was introduced to Mrs.Srimati Kumar by my sister in 2009. The best teacher in the subject anyone could have - It was and still is an experimental wisdom indeed from that day. Being a strict master and disciplinarian in what she teaches, apart from inculcating the nuances of veda and proper ways of chanting, she is also a walking model of humbleness, care, love, friendship and so many other qualities put into one. It took me sometime to see the rose amidst the thorns but once you find it - a rose is a rose.</p> 
            <p>I and a few of my fellow students can proudly proclaim that what we have truly mastered a few portions of vedas - not by reading from a book but by memorising it word by word with the correct shabdha and swara. If I can render rudram like a song today it is only through Bhagwan’s blessing and my teachers efforts. Thought to be most difficult because of its length I alongwith a few chosen students memorised the 32 anuvakas of Aruna Prasnam and chant it as a samarpanam to Bhagwan till date. It was a tapas we undertook for the past one year and the rigorous training by our teacher. Words cannot fill-in the gratitude I feel today to Bhagawan for giving me such a wonderful teacher. <br> </p> 
            <p>I think the following poem that I read sometime back will be apt at this juncture.</p> 
            <p align="center">A teacher is like Spring,<br> Who nurtures new green sprouts,<br> Encourages and leads them,<br> Whenever they have doubts.</p> 
            <p align="center">A teacher is like Summer,<br> Whose sunny temperament<br> Makes studying a pleasure,<br> Preventing discontent.</p> 
            <p align="center">A teacher is like Fall,<br> With methods crisp and clear,<br> Lessons of bright colors<br> And a happy atmosphere.</p> 
            <p align="center">A teacher is like Winter,<br> While it's snowing hard outside, <br> Keeping students comfortable,<br> As a warm and helpful guide.</p> 
            <p align="center">Teacher, you do all these things,<br> With a pleasant attitude;<br> You're a teacher for all seasons,<br> And you have my gratitude!</p>

            <p align="justify">MY GURU IN MANY GARBS<br> <br> “If you know me and you don’t know GOD, don’t worry, you’ll know”, How simple! Yet so profound!!<br> <br> Only Sadguru Sai can make such profound statement sound so simple. So, here is my heartfelt tribute to my most revered and beloved Sai... our Swami, the Guru of all Gurus.<br> <br> I pay my tribute by remembering a few of those persons who made a huge difference in my life by guiding me, directing me towards my goal, though they never, ever imagined that they were instrumental in making me what I am today.<br> <br> I remember each one of my teachers from Maharani’s Middle School, St.Patricks’ High School and Banasthali Vidyapith but the ONE teacher, who turned out to be the real Guru is Dr. Ravindra Agnihotri, my professor in B.Ed College (and a ‘Dada’ now, for last 45 years). He taught us Hindi. I was confident that my Hindi was perfect but he was not. There wasn’t a day when I didn’t argue and he didn’t scold me. I thought he hated me for being outspoken and was unnecessarily harsh towards me. The day before my practical examination of B.Ed. he threw me out of class and made me prepare the lesson all over again. I still have that lesson-plan with me. Oh! How humiliated I felt, how bitterly I cried, how resolutely I prepared my new lesson... result? Of course a first class! Later on ‘Dada’ told me that in many years of teaching, for the first time he had found a student whom he could groom as an ideal teacher and there I was, with my childish ego and Bong-pride. He had promised himself to mould me and those taunts, rebukes and bouts of anger were all towards that goal. On Guru Poornima I confess, I could not have excelled in my field without my Guru’s hard work and tremendous confidence in me. My loving pranams to you ‘Dada’.<br> <br> Another ‘Guru’ came in my life in Puttaparthi, in the garb of a student.<br> <br> In the year 2000, we came and settled down in Puttaparthi. I was teaching in a children’s home where orphans and destitute children were being taught. They were very intelligent and curious. I had told them about my mother’s last journey to Puttaparthi (H2H Vol.6, issue II). They sympathised with me and insisted that she had merged in Swami, so I should be happy.<br> <br> On 7th May, my father expired. I was inconsolable, because within a few days I was going to meet him as the reservations were already done and now this bolt from the blue!<br> <br> On reaching school I found all the children glum and teary eyed. They told me that last evening a little boy Shiva had lost his mother and now I lost my father.<br> <br> I won’t go into the whole story but share with you the enlightening comments of my tiny Gurus.<br> <br> Raghu – “Teacher don’t worry, all of us are orphans now... same pinch!” With a smile he pinched my hand.<br> Shiva – “Teacher, your mother was already up there, my amma went yesterday. So, your father won’t feel lonely. Maybe by now they are all friends.”<br> <br> Then the most profound comment came from Ambika, an eleven year old girl.<br> “Teacher, how lucky you are!” I looked at her shell-shocked. She explained, “You see, your mother already merged with Swami, now your father has also merged in Him. Daily during darshan you can see them in Swami, how lucky!! Teacher, they will be really happy to see you so happy with us.”<br> <br> I am sure Swami will be happy to see me remembering all my Gurus on this day!<br> <br> Jai Sai Ram!</p>

Guru resembles the trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.<br> <br> Brahma is a creator. Guru creates or inculcates knowledge in the minds of the students. Guru is Vishnu. Lord Vishnu maintains the creation. Similarly Guru helps in keeping up the knowledge.<br> <br> Guru is also Shiva. Shiva is the destroyer. Guru destroys or gets rid of the ignorance from the students' minds.<br> <br> Sri Veda Vyasa is said to be the first human teacher, who is an incarnation of Vishnu himself. This is the reason his birth day is celebrated in remembrance of Gurus. Vyasa Purnima is known as Guru Purnima.<br> <br> On this significant day, I offer my pranams to my sloka class teacher, Mrs. Harini Amudhan. She conducts sloka classes for the young children from the age of 3. Every week end, she takes the classes and teaches us the important slokas. She also explains to us the meaning of such slokas and also narrates the story from the epics. To make our belief get firm, she conducts value based activities like Quiz, Dramas, and Games etc. She does it all as a divine service and her effort are unparallel. A seed only grows in to a big tree. She has inculcated values in me, for which I am grateful to her. I have been inspired by her selfless service and dedication in imparting knowledge to the community. To such lineage of teachers, I offer my pranams. <br> “Sadasiva Samarambham Sankaracharya Madhyamam<br> Asmad Acharya Paryantham Vande Guru Paramparam”<br> <br> I offer my salutation to the lineage of Guru Parampara starting with lord Sadasiva, with Adi Sankara in the middle and continuing up to all my immediate teachers.</p>

            <p align="justify">MY GURU:<br> <br> My Balavikas Guru Smt. Malathi Subramanyam first showed me my Divine Satguru Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba in 1969. I and my elder sister Ms. Parvathi were fascinated by the Nagar Sankeertan done by the Sai devotees and took part regularly in this spiritual event. One of the Sai devotees who was our neighbor saw our interest and took both of us to meet Smt.Malathi Subramaniam who was regularly conducting Balavikas classes in our locality-Jeera in Secunderabad in Andhra Pradesh. From then our spiritual journey started in right earnest and with great fervor under the able and inspiring guidance of my Guru whom we started fondly addressing as Malathi Ma. She made the Balavikas classes very interesting by teaching us boys and girls Shlokas and Bhajans in the correct raga and with proper intonation which were always and invariably capped with fascinating stories related our beloved Swami Indian Mythology, Culture and Spirituality. As advised and desired by our beloved Swami, Balavikas classes for children were started for the first time in early 1970 by Malathi Ma in the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secunderabad in Andhra Pradesh and this legacy is continued till date by Swami’s blessings at different centers in these two cities, as mentioned in her book titled “SAI THE ULTIMATE” published in the year 2012. During summer vacations our Guru Malathi Ma used to conduct Balavikas classes everyday and initiated us into the learning of First Aid, Embroidery (for girls), Sanskrit and Yoga etc. We eagerly looked forward to these classes and learned a lot in the process. In those days when Swami was on a visit to Hyderabad, there used to be Nagar Sankeertan by Balavikas students everyday early morning which we attended regularly along with our Guru Malathi Ma and thus got the good fortune of singing Bhajans in the presence of our beloved Swami, light the Arathi and finally get vibhuthi and other kinds of prasadam from his hands. <br> <br> As far back as 1973 our Guru Malathi Ma started teaching Purusha Suktham and Mantra Pushpam to us the Balavikas children, who in turn were always given the opportunity of receiving our beloved Swami with Poornakumbham at Shivam whenever Swami was on a visit to Hyderabad. Malathi Ma always made it a point to take us along for singing Bhajans at Shivam during every visit of our Swami to Hyderabad. After I came out of Balavikas, our Guru Malathi Ma enabled us to conduct Balavikas classes at her residence at Jeera in Secunderabad thus turning us into blossoming Balavikas teachers and this tradition we are continuing till date since the last three decades. Malathi Ma taught us melodious bahajan songs like Oyi Rama, Anasuya Nandana, Sri Sai Shirdi Wala, Sai Ram Sai Ram, Chentha Jercha Velavamma, Sangeetha Ramayanam, Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva Enaradha to name a few.<br> <br> When I came of marriageable age, our Guru Malathi Ma felt that all that I had learned over the years would go a waste if I got married into a family of non-devotees of our beloved Swami. Hence with Swami’s permission and blessing she made me her daughter-in-law in 1982. If not for Malathi Ma, I would not have come into Swami’s fold and I do not know how my life would have turned out to be. I continue to take Balavikas classes for children and also teach Vedas to elders every Saturday and Sunday. All this has been possible only because of the blessings of our beloved Swami who guided me into Malathi Ma’s able hands. Though my Guru Malathi Ma reached the Lotus Feet of our beloved Swami on March 5th, 2010, I still feel that she is very much with us guiding me in my spiritual path under the ever watchful and loving glance of our beloved Swami. I wish and sincerely pray that Malathi Ma should be my Guru and our beloved SAI my Satguru in all my future births. I LOVE you Malathi Ma and thank you so much. I prayerfully dedicate this to my Guru Malathi Ma and my Satguru Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba. Please find herewith also attached a photo of Malathi Ma.</p>

They are like Vishnu, as they protect all the good qualities in students. They are the like Maheswara as they destroy the bad qualities. My humble salutations at the lotus feet of our Universal Guru Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba.<br> <br> It’s my privilege and pleasure to write on Guru on this auspicious occasion of Guru Poornima. Guru is one who dispels the darkness of our mind. When we are born in this world, we come to know that our parents are our first Guru. My journey began with my first Guru i.e. my beloved mother. In my childhood, I did not realise the value of my parents. When I grew up, I started respecting them. My mom and dad are the ones who encouraged me to know about the moral values of life. After my parents, my elder brother also inspired me to lead a meaningful life. As I grew up my parents took me to another Guru who teaches the knowledge of this world. They are my respected Teachers.<br> <br> In 2010, I joined Smt. Eswaramma E.M. School, which was converted from Telugu medium to English medium by the Divine Will of Swami. While studying in this temple of learning, I understood the true meaning of Guru.&nbsp;I've&nbsp;realised that our teachers are engaged to fulfil Swami’s divine mission.&nbsp;They always show us the way to become a part of that mission. They are so kind and compassionate towards us which are impossible to describe in words.<br> <br> The teachers of our school are the ones, who lead us to the path to become true human being and follow the guidelines of our Spiritual Guru, who is none other than Bhagawan Baba. He is our Universal and Eternal Guru.<br> <br> I would like to conclude that, we should never forget the contribution of our Gurus as they have sacrificed many things to make our future better. We should always respect them from our heart and be always thankful to them for everything they have done for our sake.<br> <br> ...Jaya Guru Jaya Guru Sairam… Jagat Guru Sathya Sai Ram…</p>

She taught the truth that "Swami is the Brahman".<br> <br> My second Guru is my Balavikas teacher, late Sri. Krishnamurty gaaru at Srikakulam. He instilled in me the path of a spiritual life with human values through educare. He gave me the opportunity to participate in Balavikas Rally in Puttaparthy. There, I have been very fortunate to experience Bhagwan's abundant love when he questioned me "Where did you come from?", which later&nbsp;I realised that it was a Divine message in which Swami wanted to convey the truth "Isavasyam Idam Jagat (the entire world is permeated by God)". I always remembered his teachings in every step as a balavikas convener.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br> My next inspiring guru in my life is my Veena Sir, Sri Ayyagaari Satyaprasad gaaru.

            <p>My guru whom from the bottom of my heart I call so is my Baala Vikaas guru Pavithra akka. She has been my guide, friend, sister who changed me from what I was to what I am. I was a very adamant child. If I wanted something I do be adamant and get it. But Pavithra akka changed me. Change would not be the apt word. She transformed me. She brought me close to Swami. She made believe that there is someone above waiting to listen to me. There is someone above guiding me and guarding me. There is someone above showering mercy in bounty on me. She made me. <br> <br> I went wrong many a times in life. Many a wrong decisions due to my adamant nature but she guided me to eternal guru, my swami and corrected me. She is that perfect embodiment of love as Swami used to address. <br> <br> I thank my Baala Vikaas Guru from the bottom of my heart with all might, yet I fall short of words to express my gratitude for my Guru. My Guru brought me to the Eternal Guru. The embodiment of Love. The ever guiding, ever loving Sai Maa. Pavithra akka was the reason for the transformation of the statement from Bhagavan Baba to Swami my dearest Sai Maa.<br> <br> Dear Swami I always fall short of words when I have shown my gratitude for all that you have given me. Swami I would beg to differ by stating "I want to be with you always, rather than asking you to be with me. For you never leave me. But, it is I who might move away from Thee. Swami let that not happen. Let me always be under Thy cover.<br> <br> SWAMI... My humble offering at your LOTUS FEET.</p>

            <p>I had, from my birth, brought up in a family of sports persons, my father representing the then Madras Province, in cricket. My uncles represented their college in foot-ball. But somehow I took the habits fit enough to be close to arrogance. It was till the end of the 1980s. Once a relative of mine called me to accompany her to Abbotsbury in Chennai, where one Saibaba was staying and we can get Darshan of Him. Reluctantly I accompanied her to the place and had His Darshan. Sometime later one of my sisters (cousin) asked me to come to her house for attending a Sai Bhajan session. I went as my wife persuaded me saying I should respect the invitation from the elders in the family. I went for the first time without much interest, next week I went on my own interest, third week I participated on my own and finally on the fourth I started singing Bhajans. I became a member of the Organisation, started regular service activities. Without my knowing the bad qualities in me, left. I became a soft spoken, warm, friendly and helpful person.<br> <br> I cannot forget the first time I took my beloved Swami's Padanamaskar in 1991. I became a totally different person from then on. There can never be better Guru than my beloved Swami, I consider myself very fortunate to come into His fold. Must be due to the Punyas I must have done in past births.<br> I am also grateful to my Sister-in-law, who first called me to have His Darshan at Abbotsbury, and my Cousin and her husband, from whom I have learnt many good things in life, for directing me to SWAMI. They were Sai devotees for a long time.</p>

I am trying to follow his advice but some times I am unable to be a good disciple thus HE is Jagathguru and I am one of His devotee.<br> I am very much grateful to my beloved friend Dr. R.Saminathan of Karaikudi and my beloved brother Sundara Srinivasan.K. of Karaikudi who showed the path of Bhagawan Sathya Saibaba and still I am remembering the chillness of Kodaikanal with sweet voice of Swami.

            <p>Guru is the one who directs you towards God. One cannot reach anywhere close to the Lord without the help and blessings of the Guru. If the Guru wills then everything is possible. I wish to pay my respects to my Guru Dr. N. Sivakumar – senior faculty member at the SSSIHL, Brindavan, Bengaluru who helped me to study directly under my Lord Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba. It was in the year 2001 when after about 3 years of work experience I had a desire to further my education with a MBA degree. An alumni co-brother guided me to the MBA programme of SSSIHL. Soon I had the letter from the institute asking me to get ready and be prepared for the gruelling entrance examination of the institute. Books I had many, Time I had in sufficient amount but Confidence I lacked completely. This was when my Guru came into the limelight who took upon himself the arduous task of teaching me to face the task ahead. He taught the subjects of the entrance examination to me, encouraged me with his talks and administered many a mock test on me to strengthen my belief that I can pass the examination with some extra effort from my side. He also advised me that this is the best institute to earn the MBA degree from as it is the Lord Himself who is teaching you here. Those words of advice did have its miracle effect; I studied well, wrote the entrance examination to the best of my capability and did well in the group discussion as well. I soon found myself sitting in the students’ block of Sai Kulwant hall amongst many other students who presumably would have gone through the same rigour that I had. My Guru was happy, I was elated as at that time this student in white was no longer an ordinary student but was recognized as a Sai Student. I was directly under the care of my Lord Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba for the MBA programme from 2002-2004. I thank you Sir for having inspired me during my student days and sparing your efforts in helping me reach where I am now. I share my humble gratitude to the entire teaching fraternity who help students come up in life with quality education.</p>

You have been my mother, father, guru and above all my best friend all though these years being there for me whenever I wanted you. You have been the inner voice that I listen when I pray before making any decision pertaining to any small thing. Whatever I’m today is because of your blessings that you have showered upon my family all through these years. Though my parents have attained your lotus feet, you have been there for me as my mother and father always. As a guru you are there to enlighten us with your wisdom to guide and show us the correct path.<br> <br> I still cannot forget the day when I had the privilege to see the orange robe in Parthi flowing vibrantly all through the darshan hall during the 1998 service for the inauguration of hill view stadium. It was a mighty task that had to be accomplished, but your blessings and supervision saw this pass through with everyone who had assembled to view the exhibition match go back with their hearts and stomach full. Looking at the massive crowd we all had one doubt that would be food suffices for all the people, but you still had your own way of making things happen. The food packet once we started distributing was like an akshaya vessel with the packets never ending.<br> <br> You have been the guiding factor in my life till date and you will always be. It’s your eyes that speak when we look into you guiding us and providing us the key for all the obstacles in our life. As you said “Love all serve all” we as your children will always strive to achieve this. As you have said in your Shirdi Sai avatar “MY TOMB SHALL BLESS AND SPEAK TO THE NEEDS OF THE DEVOTEES” we always will run to our home the BHOO LOGA VAIKUNTAM “Prashanti Mandir”, to have a glimpse of your darshan and seek your blessings. Bless the whole universe with peace and prosperity and make this entire world a heaven by your love and blessings.</p>

Some reasons that Saira aunty has made a very big impact on me are the valuable lessons about the five human values (Truth, right conduct, peace, love and nonviolence) and about Swami’s life and teachings. The lessons helped me focus more in school, be kind to everybody, and be responsible. Learning about Swami’s teachings helped me by making me a better person and made a very big difference in my behaviour. That is why I am very grateful to Saira aunty for teaching so many important lessons on this auspicious day, Guru Poornima. Sairam. </p>

We are so blessed to be present on earth at the time of this most powerful, unprecedented Avathar. He is the one who is guiding each and every one of His children slowly but surely towards the realisation of the Truth of who we are. We will probably never understand or realise the enormity of all that He is doing for us - blessing us with the right experiences needed for our growth, the right people in our lives at the right time to help and guide us, and prompting and guiding as the Inner Voice, when we care to listen. May we be blessed always with the right guidance and strength to fulfil His will for us.</p>

            <p>I am 67 years old lady. I am thankful to h2h for giving me chance to express my feelings towards my guru “Swami”; yes, Swami is my only Guru who always guided me in every phase of life. At the time of any difficulty swami send for me help or guided in other way. Swami you taught me to follow the right path of truth and I promise you Swami that I will always follow your teachings. Swami you permitted me to do translations of your moral stories, your sayings and other spiritual literature in Hindi language for the Hindi magazine ‘Sai Samachar” being published from Lucknow U.P. for Hindi readers. I feel blessed for doing this small work given by you Swami. There are also some other gurus like mata pita teachers but all are your form so I feel very grateful for them also. Swami, please shower your grace upon me and all devotees. Once again my guru, my Swami, I love you.</p>

            <p>No&nbsp;word can really express what the heart feels when Baba enters to transform and enlighten the life of anyone, but at least expressing gratitude to Whom is beyond words in this form, is an action that is worthy.</p> 
            <p>With this poem I try to describe an experience that happened to me years ago, a vision of a place I've never seen before, where Swami was surrounded by many people, talking and teaching them. With time, I learned that the place really exists (Brindavan) and was a point of reunion for devotees, where He used to give darshan. At that time, I was unable to travel. However, that was the beginning of a soul journey, from a heart with an unstable faith to complete surrender. Thank you Swami! You are always with us!</p>

            Salutations to our JagathGuru Sri Sai Guru!
            <br> A candle lit at a corner lightens up the entire premises. Then let us imagine our life's sojourn as the expansive Kulwant hall with the glowing chandelier lights spreading a divine aura all over the precincts. What a marvellous sight it would be! Our Gurus are like the lights in the chandelier that adds beauty even to the glass crystals. From Kindergarten to University, all our gurus play the role of gardeners who nurture us with valuable nutrients, trim our wrongdoings, and shield us from the chillness of filth and the heat of hatred. Like carpenters, they chisel us into perfect instruments scarifying the dirt from our inner being. Our Balvikas gurus lay a strong foundation, building us block by block in the divine construction such that every cell of ours follows His teachings, every limb performs His action and every breath echoes His name.
            <br> I take this opportunity to convey my love and regards to all my teachers from kindergarten to 10th(Chennai), teachers of Sri Sathya Sai Higher Secondary School, my lecturers and professors from Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning(Anantapur Campus) , my music teachers, my classical dance teachers, my Balvikas gurus, my veena teacher and my bhajan gurus. My love to my parents who are my first, the best and evergreen gurus and also my grandparents, my special gurus.
            <br> 
            <br> My special love to my maternal grandfather Sri S.R. Ayuthanaman whom I consider as my Atma-Guru, because of whom I am what I am today. My grandfather would always mention,"Balaadapi Sukhadapi", meaning" we must learn from a child and also from a parrot."
            <br> 
            <br> "Dear thatha, Thanks may not suffice for the knowledge you shared with me, but I promise that I would make all efforts to follow you instructions at every step."

            Humble salutations to the lotus feet of The Ever Loving Swami.
            <br> 
            <br> I would like to dedicate this Guru Purnima to all my Gurus who have been a guiding light to me all my life. First, to all I would like to thank all my Balvikas Gurus of because of whom my dream of Graduating under Sai's fold is coming true this 19th of July 2014. They are Aunt Syamala, Aunt Sooria, Aunt Rama, Sis Nanda, Aunt Chan, Aunt Shuroma, Aunt Padma, Bro.Mahavishnu, Sis. Shushinta and Sis. Suguntha. It is because of them that we the Sai children have manage to experience the bliss of being a Sai warrior, a Sai medium and Sai's hope of spreading His love.
            <br> 
            <br> Also not forgetting those Gurus who have deceased from sight but not our hearts. This is none other than Uncle Venugopal who showed us the way a man or probably a Sai Child should live. He lived like a legacy and by the time he passed, he set an exemplary to all of us that if you want to live, this is how you should live.
            <br> 
            <br> I would also like to thank all my Gurus who have been my source of inspiration to me in Music namely, Shri Sumeet Tappoo ji and Shri Shankar Mahadevan ji. They have spread love through their magnificent Music and turned various hearts towards God through their Music.
            <br> 
            <br> Last but not least, I would also like to thank my Best Friend Forever (Swami), for not letting me down during my tough times. Thank you for showing me the right way for me to walk across this Ocean of Samsara. Oh Lord Baba, thank you for being part of me, my life and my soul. My prayers to you is that, make my love for You grow stronger day by day that we both can't live without each other even for a second. Love you Swami, love You for the way You have been.

            Words are insufficient to express my gratitude and love for my first teachers, my Parents. Guru is one who removes our ignorance, the darkness that surrounds our life and infuses light from within. I owe the upliftment in my life to Bhagawan who inspires love from within and guides us in the best path life offers, the path of Bhakti or Unconditional Love.
            <br> 
            <br> Every moment life opens itself for me and all I have to do is accept things and people that come into life and share my love and receive the same in return. Love is both logic &amp; magic which works wonders in our mundane life.
            <br> 
            <br> If you know Him, nothing else matters. If you Love Him, nothing else matters.
            <br> Who is HE? He is you; you are Him, united forever.
            <br> 
            <br> Let’s practice unconditional Love and please our Lord and live a happy &amp; wholesome life. :)

            My beloved Balvikas guru has guided me in so many aspects that it would take hours to recollect .My humble salutations to my beloved guru.
            <br> 
            <br> Would love to highlight a few aspects which I learnt from my guru during the Balvikas classes which I consider has helped me a lot.
            <br> 
            <br> 1. To always discriminate between right and wrong and courageously pursue the right path.
            <br> 
            <br> 2. Not to join bad company even under great peer pressure.
            <br> 3. Not to take the credit fully for every good thing but to remember with gratitude and thank god and all those who helped.
            <br> 
            <br> 4 To chant slokas in the morning and before sleep without fail.
            <br> 
            <br> 5. To daily do namaskars to parents daily whenever we are with them.
            <br> 
            <br> 6. Never talk more than necessary.
            <br> 
            <br> 7. To be aware that we are never alone and Bhagawan is always with us and waiting to guide and help us. Hence to seek Bhagawan’s guidance when we feel like and have any fear or anxiety.
            <br> 
            <br> 8. Never to talk ill of anyone in their absence, instead to tell them politely on the face if we feel something is not right. 
            <br> 
            <br> 9. To be contented and not to compare and be greedy or jealous.
            <br> 
            <br> 10. To do atleast minimum possible help to the needy. If nothing is possible to atleast pray for them.

            Swami is everything to me. He orchestrated my life and gave me all my teachers and guides. I want to devote this short letter to one of them. It happened about 45 years ago when I was 20 years old and quite confused young man. Asher Shimoni (his name means happiness in Hebrew) asked me if I want to play with him a game (I met him by chance on the beach and we did not know each other). In a few minutes he was able to water my soul with golden words of courage and wisdom that were for me then like water to a man dying from thirst in a desert. This brief meeting blossomed into a life-long friendship until my friend passed away about 7 years later. I will never forget Asher and I am sending him waves of gratitude while I know that the eternal witness is watching the show :). Thank you, Swami!

            There is more kindness than we know in the World because so often through humility it remains hidden; a friend who has done the most wonderful service but who only told me of it when pressed; a monk who eschews the gown and the monastery for everyday worker clothes and a modest flat in NYC, but who is to my mind the more monkishly devout because of his simple humility. I have another friend who has worked for 60 years in service to her church and the far broader Church of the World of which we are all members, like it or not. Her work has affected hundreds of lives and has left a legacy for thousands more. I knew her for 6 years before I realised she was even ‘religious’. These people talk about their deeds only when necessary, otherwise they simply live and ‘do’.
            <br> 
            <br> Someone I have known for 3 years at the gym heard me talking about our planned trip to India and mentioned that she is half Indian! I simply never notice folk’s colour, or sexuality for that matter, so this was an interesting and timely surprise. She gave me all sorts of tips about India and after much prodding she told me of how she and her husband were the reason a new library was built in a tiny, desperately poor village near Delhi, her home town. Indians love books but the poorest among them get to see very few. She thought of English children with laden bookshelves in their bedrooms and decided to ask each child in Kendal to gift one of their books to this village. She distributed book plates to all the Kendal children so they could fill in their names, something about themselves and their school addresses to encourage pen pal friendships. From several hundred children she received thousands of books which took over her living room and spare bedroom. She approached her husband’s company, Clarks’ Shoes, for help and they funded the crates and shipping costs. The books were dispatched by ship, transported overland by bullock carts and safely arrived in the Village. The villagers then promptly built a basic library to house them and when my friend visited some time later all the books were immaculately displayed and recorded with the fastidious attention to detail Indians are so good at. The library was full of children lost in books.
            <br> 
            <br> The monk in mufti is Khyongla Rato Rinpoche, founder of The Tibet Centre in New York. He lives in a small flat with his cat and for a long time he worked stacking shelves in the local supermarket. He is a monk among monks but chose to relinquish the red gown and monastic retreat, feeling that, for him, this way of life was too visible and possibly ego-led. Such simple humility and dedication so modestly hidden. I carry his smiling face in my heart. 
            <br> 
            <br> My other reticent friend would not want me to sing her praises here so I shall honour her wishes and not embarrass her. 
            <br> 
            <br> I love that there must be countless other kindnesses lurking behind the silence of so many other special people. I am also absolutely sure that their gentle and often dogged compassion engenders kindnesses in all those they meet and affect. And they will never know the difference they make.
            <br> 
            <br> My thanks and Love to Sathya Sai Baba, with whom we are all so much more.

            My first Guru in my life is my mother who was so caring , loving and affectionate and guided in innumerable circumstances and taught so many things and how to be confident and solve any Problems which comes.

            <br> Second Guru is my Father who has given me moral support and also guided in my education and career. Apart from this I was inspired with his ideas/thought related to service oriented activities and he himself was a member. As Such he himself was Guruswami in Ayappa temple and carried out so many services.

Even though I am not remembering all of them but I express my sincere thanks and regards to all of them who have given me good foundation and perfection. I pray to our Lord that let them be blessed with good health happiness and all their desires are fulfilled.
            <br> 
            <br> From my childhood to present moment I have come across many people but the divine/special Person who have inspired me is our lord Bhagawan Sathya Sai / Sai Ram /Sai Baba. He has guided me in all difficult situations and taught how to solve the problems and give us confidence to get through it. He taught us about the human values/, importance of Seva and so many valuable things and which I am following strictly in my day to day activities.
            <br> 
            <br> My special Guru is our Bhagawan Sathya Sai. I express my Love and heartfelt gratitude to him which Cannot be express in words and the feelings will always be there in my heart till my entire life span.

            <br> The day I was associated with our Bhagawan, He was my Guru /is my Guru/ and will be my Guru.

            We are all learning something new every day. Life seems to be the biggest teacher. I very much remember those days when I struggled to make a mark in my academics. I never thought playing without doing my daily home work will take me through the darker roads. There was this teacher, whom I admired right from my class 4th. And seeing her would make my day. Like I said, when I was not able to perform in my studies and produce the expected marks, I was put into a lot of pressure. I lost all my confidence to clear my final exams. And I feared of getting detained in the same class next year. I cried helplessly and that is when this special teacher secretly took hold of my pain and helped me in my studies. She was strict then. I had never seen this side of her face. She would not smile at me, may be she was sad that I had under performed for no reason. And that made me study harder. I never liked to see her without a smile. And the most awaited day came. My results. I had written quiet well, but I could not predict the result. I had nightmares during the beginning of the summer holidays.
            <br> 
            <br> I could not believe when my teachers told me that I had passed with above ninety plus in all the subjects. And I got an award for overall outstanding performance. And it means a lot to me even now. She was a little angel, God sent me. Every other teacher were special to me and it would take lot of time to share it with all out there. But that does not stop me from thanking each of them, as they have made me the person I am today. Sairam.

            Let me begin by thanking the H2H team for taking up this unprecedented initiative of giving a chance to the humanity of paying gratitude to their Teachers on this auspicious occasion of Guru Poornima. This indeed makes the Guru of Gurus, our Sai most happy ever.&nbsp;
            <br> 
            <br> I take this humble opportunity of offering my reverential pranams to my only Guru, Sri Sathya Sai, who has been and will be my everything all through my life. He has brought with Him several teachers in to my life and that has made me what I am today.
            <br> 
            <br> To start with, it was Swami who brought my parents without whom I would not have come to this world or write any gratitude letter like this. Thanks for the opportunity again as it let me go down the memory lane as to how they took every step to mould me since me birth and brought me up like this. It is only because of my parents that I got in to Swami's college in 2001 for 11th class as previously I was myself not confident when my marks were not even average. She instilled in me the faith, confidence and perseverance to reach the goal. She said, 'You put your 75% wholeheartedly, the rest 25% He will take care of.' And that still rings in my ears.&nbsp;
            <br> 
            <br> I would also like to pay my gratitude to a few of my teachers who have been my role models. Shine Jeecob and Merlin Anthony were my English teachers for my 10th class. They were very concerned about me as I scored just a passing mark i.e. 35/100 in 10th board exams and the required mark was 55/100 to get admission at Swami's college. Initially, it was Swami's grace that I got in to His College and later during my days in His hostel I used to keep remembering their advice which eventually led me to score 75/100 in 12th board exam. Even during my education at Swami College I had teachers though for a short span, were always very helpful to me.&nbsp;
            <br> 
            <br> In conclusion, I would like to just share and pray that all throughout my life so far Swami has been sending great people as and when required; to whom I will ever be in gratitude and also pray to Swami that let them be happy, healthy and peaceful all through their lives.

            Dearest Swami,
            <br> 
            <br> As we are engaged every day in the duties assigned by You; at every opportunity that we are able to put a smile on someone else’s face, at every chance we are able to lend a helping hand, our heart goes out to You Swami, in deep gratitude and surrender. As each day passes, we feel your love more and more in greater measure and in higher degree. Swami, whatever we may do, in whichever project we may be engaged in, whatever be the role and responsibility that we are assigned with, please bless us such that we may never ever fail to feel your presence. We are seeking your proximity and to be blessed with the opportunity of serving directly in your mission as nothing can add more meaning to our lives than savouring your love, living and serving in your presence. Now even though Swami we are no more privileged to bask in your physical proximity, we are still able to continue to bask in your unmistakable presence within, and most mystifying omnipresence without. We cannot even imagine where and how we would have been if You would not have come to our lives at the right moment and so generously conferred on us this divine presence and divine munificence of yours. We know swami you are as near to us as ever. You are as close to us as ever; ever guiding, ever protecting, ever inspiring and ever blessing. In every moment of our life, please be with us. We cannot live without you Swami.
            <br> 
            <br> Thank you Swami. I love you so so much.

            I have read in one of your articles that when Gandhiji was asked what he thought of the radio, the reply was, “I see Shakti, the power of God, in it.” and that suits RADIO SAI more than anything else... the guru through which our sadguru continues to give his precious darshan and sambhashan...
            <br> 
            <br> The most endearing teacher you can approach at any time, bringing you the love of Sai and tirelessly spreading his message all over the world... just a click away and we have beautiful videos for the eyes to feast on, soothing words for every lonely heart, musical melodies for all maladies, and when you fall sick, you can just close your eyes listening to those nectarine words which heal you better than any other medicine, bringing sathwic food to the senses... Parents are often worried to see their children glued to computers but Radio Sai serves as a great boon for them... it is being continuously played... playing the role of a Bal vikas teacher or satsang.
            <br> 
            <br> Grateful thanks to our wonderful TEACHER RADIO SAI... guiding us SAIwards... boosting our morale in Swami's mission.

            What to write and what to say. My heart is overwhelmed when I sit to write something about my Sai. I was not fortunate enough to be born in a family of Sai devotees. Sai attracted me towards HIM in 2009 and since then there has been no turning back. Four years down the lane I have been trying to become a good devotee, but I always feel this is not enough. I am a non-vegetarian and it has been my weakness. i know my SWAMI does not like me eating non-vegetarian food, but am a human being, who is still engulfed in maya and unable to break the chain of desires which has strongly held me bondage for many many births. The calling of SWAMI is becoming strong day by day and I know one day I will graduate from the nursery school where I am in at present (representing my stage of devotion) to the doctorate level with SWAMI as my guide, my guru, my love. On this Guru Poornima day, I dedicate my humble thoughts at the lotus feet of my guru and hope that it reaches HIM and he helps me come out of my maya. I thank Radio Sai for giving me this opportunity to pen down something for my sadguru. Thanks for everything SWAMI... love you always...

            Sairam. My humble namaskarams to all those who were and still are my guiding factor in each phase of my life.
            <br> 
            <br> “VIZHI KIDAIKUMA ABHAYA KARAM KIDAIKUMA
            <br> GURUNATHAN SHARANATHIL NIZHAL KIDAIKUMA...”
            <br> This beautiful song is dedicated to everybody who has inspired and guided me and has been guiding me till date.
            <br> 
            <br> Daddy and Amma – Well daddy was a fear factor for me from my childhood days but that has made me so much independent and strong. In a way he is my hidden Guru.
            <br> Amma, I confide, talk, discuss, take suggestions, she is there for me ever. Be it my decision to call off my wedding or quit my job, she would have shed more tears than me. Since we cannot see God, we got our Parents, our First Guru.
            <br> My Teacher – Mrs. Grace in Class XI, reposed so much trust in me and have me admitted in her school. Ma’am I will never forget you.
            <br> My Friends – There are many from the letter A – Z. Just a call from me, they are here for me.
            <br> Swami – Reading Satcharithra, looking at Swami’s picture gives so much solace. But I wanted a Guru with whom I could share everything under the sun. Baba heard my heart felt request and gave me a Guru. The moment I got his darshan, out came tears as if it was waiting for the flood gates to be opened. He knows me in and out. I am one among his many who have come into his fold. I do get angry with him and complain to Swami that my Guru is quite busy for me. But somehow the problem gets solved.
            <br> 
            <br> To all of them, I have not offered any Guru Dakshina but they continue to offer their service whenever I need them. I am grateful for each and every one of these inspiring souls.

            <br> the very breath with which we breathe

            <br> Humanity is Existential...
            <br> Living every moment with vigour and vitality
            <br> throbbing, pulsating Love, freedom of thought
            <br> this is the relationship called Friendship ~
            <br> acquiring this from God and submerged in His

            <br> Living for Life, is Loving God.
            <br> The One who holds your hand, Eternally.
            <br> Indebted thus to the Guru, the Teacher,
            <br> the subtle realization of being in God's company
            <br> becomes the very nature of your soul.

            <br> First of all, let me introduce myself to the H2H readers, my name is Miss Janu Vaswani, female, 53 years of age, single, lived in Hong Kong since age of 1 year. Born in Philippines on 18th March 1961, I am a blind Indian lady, educated in Hong Kong; I can speak Chinese, English, Hindi, Sindhi etc. My occupation is a volunteer and I’ve been working as a volunteer since 1982 at the Hong Kong society for the blind.
            <br> 
            <br> Since 1978 I began joining the Sathya Sai organisation and the first thing I began was singing bhajans on 24th, November, then my Balvikas life began on 30th November that same year. Please note, during my time, when I use to attend balvikas classes, Mr. Martin Mahtani, Mrs. Jyoti Mahtani, Miss. Shermila Mahtani, Mr. Chandru Daswani, Mrs. Gopi Jaisinghani, Mr. Gurum were kind enough to teach us prayers, bhajans, stories of different saints, such as: Rama, Krishna, Sathya Sai baba, Shirdi Sai baba, Jesus, Allah, and others well, Suprabhatam was taught by Mr. Chandru Daswani, bhajans were taught by Mr. Sai Deepak, Mrs. Padu Nainani. Please note, once I was a Balvikas bhajan guru for some time, but these people had dropped me out. But now I am a musician on a daily basis, I play harmonium for different gatherings daily.
            <br> 
            <br> I give thanks to all my Balvikas gurus for their time and efforts which they've put. I also give thanks to the h2h team for giving me this opportunity to write this short article to share with the readers about my life in Balvikas.

            <p>I studied in a Mission School long back. I don't remember all my teachers except one Mr. C.J.R. Price, from Australia, who was the Principal and who joined us in our daily prayer meetings, to sing the school song, the motto of which is to be upright any time, everywhere. </p> 
            <p>Even today the song rings in me loud and clear, after many many decades. His moral teachings in prayer hall, his commitment, service, sacrifice and above all his love and personal touch with students and parents, certainly influenced my life tremendously, in my formative years and widened my horizons. I take this opportunity on this sacred GURU PURNIMA day to pay my respects and homage to this great SOUL.</p>

            <p>Dearest Swami,<br> <br> Who else can be the Guru for me except You? You’re the one who sends these teachers my way when I am doubtful, or when I just need physical assistance with mundane things. If I thank you, that means I am thanking everyone who made a “difference” in my life. I’m thankful for all You have done for me Swami: for giving me a life in which I can serve You and love You, for giving me a wonderful family who supports and encourages me to follow a path that You have laid out for me, for giving me wonderful SSE teachers who are always encouraging us to do the right thing and just love You more and more, for giving me an education both spiritually and worldly, for giving me mentors who are able to explain to me the simplicity of spirituality, for Radio Sai for giving me and everyone across the globe an opportunity to ruminate over You and Your Love. </p> 
            <p>I just pray that You make me Love all with the capital “L” like You did in the physical form and still continue to do in Your cosmic form and Serve all with a capital “S” like you did—Selflessly, as You have done and still continue to do. I can’t even express in words how grateful I am to You Swami! I offer this humble offering at Your Divine Lotus Feet.<br> <br> “My Mother, Father, and Dearest Friend and Guide<br> Yes that’s what gives me joy and pride.<br> A mother who gives her selfless Love,<br> Who is as pure as the whiteness of a dove.<br> A father who makes sure I’m following righteousness,<br> Who makes sure I don’t live life with carelessness.<br> A dearest friend indeed,<br> The only one who will come at my need.<br> A guide he is to many,<br> And doesn’t ask even for a penny.<br> A guru who comes down,<br> To take the jewels of His Divine crown.”</p>

            <strong>TEACHERS ARE SPECIAL INDEED</strong>
            <br> 
            <br> In memories of my most special teacher, my balvikas guru Mrs. Maya Dharwadkar...
            <br> 
            <br> We meet different people in the journey of life making a difference to our lives, but there is a special someone who inspires us by giving us some precious insights. Apart from mother and father, there are some angels who truly keep guiding us, the special ones whom we are blessed to find correcting us in our daily lives.
            <br> 
            <br> To the ones who have been working harder day and night to educate each one of us, here is a token of my love to teachers for having gifted this world their love in abundance.
            <br> 
            <br> Every teacher is special in my life but there is one teacher, who taught me a beautiful line, 
            <em>Sai hamara hum sai ke aisa prem hamara, sairam hamara sairam hamara</em> everytime. Yes, it was my balvikas teacher, who gifted me the keys to unlock life’s useful guidelines; she was the medium who taught me ways to connect to divinity more closely at all times.
            <br> 
            <br> She was not just a teacher but more like a guide, a friend who could answer my queries. She believed in all the work I did by showing immense faith in me and my capabilities. If there is any way that I could offer my love to her as her balvikas student or as a youth, it’s only by walking on the glorious godly path that she taught me since my childhood.
            <br> 
            <br> She was a role model in the lives of each one of us, youngsters as well as elders, an epitome of humility, sincerity, love and a true teacher chosen by Bhagawan. She is no more amongst us physically but her ideals and memories are prevalent in our hearts, a teacher who truly inspired me personally, I offer my deepest gratitude and sincere love.

            <p> This day, I am elated to convey my special and hearty thanks to my most loving Balvikas guru, Smt.

            <br> Mahatma Gandhi and Einstein are also great souls with whom I could connect and bring a change in me. Although there were many such eminent personalities who had an impact on me... I would always ask myself “Does Baba approve of this person?"... "Is the message same as what Baba says?"... 
            <br> 
            <br> So my ultimate and only Guru is Baba. I always thank the Lord for having found a Guru at an early age and giving me the privilege to know Him, learn from Him and follow Him.
            <br> 
            <br> There is a popular Kannada song composed by Purandaradasa with the lyrics "Bhakti Sukhavo Mukti Sukhavo?" which means is bhakti (devotion) better or Mukti (salvation). I have tasted Bhakti with my dear Baba and every day of my life is meaningful because of Him.

            Dearest Lord,
            <br> 
            <br> From darkness you brought me to light;
            <br> Compassion flowed in your mere sight
            <br> Every word of yours brought transformation;
            <br> Your Hue of orange, to my soul is a revelation
            <br> Every time you gave a second chance;
            <br> Lessons of life that take us to trance
            <br> You are a Rose and I - a piece of clay;
            <br> Being close to you, thy sweet fragrance of love moulds me without delay 
            <br> Years after years, births after births, the cycle of karma continues;
            <br> And so the bond between you and me, for sure you would never let me loose
            <br> Trials and tribulations bring tears to my eyes as i weep in distress;
            <br> But remembrance of thy lotus feet dissolves away my stress
            <br> Your words of love echoes in my heart and I feel like asking 
            <br> "Have you forgotten me?"
            <br> The next moment my inner voice soothes me saying
            <br> "How can that ever be?"
            <br> Embraced by your divine love, my soul is healed;
            <br> When will I be yours dear Lord?
            <br> You alone are my guardian and Guide... My loving Guru!

            <p> My beloved Swami is my Guru forever and ever. He is guiding me through this life as a Mother, Friend, Guru. Though I didn't have the opportunity to enjoy the physical presence of my Swami, the bliss which I am experiencing now is much more than that. No words to express that feeling. He is always with us. Whenever I am feeling down, I go to none other than my Swami. I share with him everything.<br> <br> He has made me happy through many <em>darshan</em> in dreams. I feel my Swami each second. There is a reason for feeling Swami as my Guru. There are many people who will tell you what is wrong and right, what I should do and I shouldn't. But Swami instead teaches us to tackle all the problems by making us to face that problem instead of hiding from that problem. </p> 
            <p>If suppose I am afraid to face a situation and it is bothering me a lot, Swami doesn't help us by preventing me from facing that situation. Instead He puts us into that situation and gives us all strength and helps us get through that fear completely. Thanks a lot from all us Swami for guiding us through our lives!!!</p> 
            <p> At this moment, I am remembering a special song which I would like to dedicate to my Saimaaaa... each word in this song is true from heart Swami...

            It is with heartfelt gratitude that I pay tribute to the one person, apart from Bhagawan whom I saw as my GURU through eyes as a child, a teenager and right throughout my adulthood, he is my DAD who right now in heaven.
            <br> 
            <br> My DAD was such a special man in my life, he taught me to be a strong woman and to understand that LIFE can be a huge CHALLENGE, that from time to time I will walk through FIRE and that weapons could be formed against me, but he showed me that with steadfast devotion and contemplation on GOD, I would have a protector for life like no other. He showed me the path to spirituality at a very tender age, and even though he wanted me to face the world bravely, he always protected me in his own loving way.
            <br> 
            <br> What more in life could I ask for than being shown the path of spirituality, for with this fell into place all other aspects of my life.
            <br> 
            <br> Today I am a mother with two children, and how more clear do I see my DAD, my GURU when I confer on my kids all that he taught me.

            I strained outside the Mandir main gate to catch a glimpse of the orange robe. The bhajans were playing, but on this Guru Poornima, this day honouring my teacher, Sai Baba, I could not see him. I could only see thousands of other people seated in the vast hall. Never before had I not seen Baba. I could not believe it.
            <br> 
            <br> Then a parade of hand powered tricycles came towards the gate, each with a new owner and a Seva Dal attendant. Baba must have just gifted these cycles and with them, independence for the riders.
            <br> 
            <br> And so, in their faces, I saw the teacher, and received Darshan and a new lesson to contemplate.

Their love and the confidence in me made me a self-reliant person. Thanks a lot Amma and Appa. I love you.<br> <br> <span class="paraboldteal14">Guru:</span><br> Next is my Uncle Mr. Narayanan who merged in Swami a few years ago. He was my first Balvikas Guru who inspired and encouraged me to do Manava Seva. Thanks a lot Uncle. I know you must have attained Moksha for the service you did to the society. If not you would have definitely got a place in Swami’s heart. I love you.<br> <br> Fourth is my Balvikas Guru Mrs. Prema Madhusudhanan who is deemed to be my foster mother. She inspired me to be a Balvikas Guru myself. Her encouragement and confidence in me boosted my self-confidence. Thanks a lot Aunty. I am always grateful to you and still cannot forget the way you would teach us many values. I love you.<br> <br> <span class="paraboldteal14pt">Daivam:</span><br> Last but not the least is my eternal friend and Guru - My dearest Swami. He stands by me always. He smiles and laughs with me. He is always there to wipe my tears. He pushes me into delusion and pulls me away from it. He is my Sadguru and Jagadguru. Thank you Swami. I love you.<br> <br> Wait, Did I forget to thank one more person? Yes, of course. My husband Balaji assumes the role of at least one of the above in times of need and guides me. I love you dear.</p>

            Lost was I in the crowd of Mumbai as a XII STD student, shuttling between crash entrance coaching and a self thrusted ambition of becoming a doctor! With the ego of being a Medical entrance student, the courses like BSc. felt like the options of the hopeless!! Then one day, I met a gentleman in whites...and my life changed...
            <br> 
            <br> The life that was centred around MBBS and merit lists slowly fondled a desire to be in the crowd that wore Whites and clustered around a single beauty clad in Orange.
            <br> 
            <br> Life no longer felt like a race to print a designation next to my name...all it desired was for a smile, a glance, a touch...and perhaps a few words from that orange beauty...perhaps, a transition from calling him "Sri Sai Baba"...to "my dear Swami".
            <br> 
            <br> Life just searched for a medium to be close to Him...and the 'gentleman in whites' with a smile told me, there could possibly be a medium..."why don't you try for BSc in BioSciences in Swami's institute?.." and produced an application form of admission to SSSIHL.
            <br> 
            <br> With Bhagawan's grace, I never looked back since that day! On this occasion of Guru Pournima, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to that 'gentleman in whites' for opening up a door into my life which I will cherish forever...a door that chose GOD...and BSc. was no longer a course of the hopeless...because then, it was my ONLY HOPE to be near HIM!
            <br> 
            <br> To Shri Tushar Swadia...'the gentleman in whites'.
