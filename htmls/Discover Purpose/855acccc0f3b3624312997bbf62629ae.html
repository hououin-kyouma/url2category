          <p>by HeatherAsh Amara</p> 
          <p><b>Learn the Way of the Warrior Goddess</b></p> 
          <p>Since its publication a short time ago, HeatherAsh Amara’s <i>Warrior Goddess Training</i> has become much more than just a book―its ten lessons have inspired thousands of women around the world to reclaim their power, their passion, and their freedom. In this much anticipated follow-up, <i>The Warrior Goddess Way</i>, Amara goes deeper, revealing three additional pillars of Warrior Goddess living that readers can apply to travel further down this sacred path: Wisdom, Authenticity, and Yes!</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li><b>Wisdom</b> arises naturally when we learn to listen. Not to the voices in our head, but the voices in our cells, our natural discernment, and our creative knowing.</li> 
           <li><b>Authenticity</b> is embracing your vulnerability, your silliness, and owning all your superpowers. It’s accepting and loving what is, not what “should be.”</li> 
           <li><b>Yes!</b> is about celebrating everything. All the time. (Even your greatest defeats.)</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>In exploring these three pillars, Amara delves into topics such as forgiveness, relationships, and finding your inner stillness. You will learn the art of maintaining emotional balance, cultivating self-respect, practicing heartfelt communication, and the power of consciously embracing life’s beginnings and endings. Like Warrior Goddess Training, this book is packed full of exercises and explorations designed to help you integrate the Warrior Goddess Way into your everyday life.</p> 
          <p>You CAN learn to enjoy everything you do. Your potential for dancing through life is waiting to be awakened. Live the Warrior Goddess Way and claim the woman you are destined to be.</p>

          <p>A Road Map to Reclaiming&nbsp;Your Authentic Self</p> 
          <p>The ancient Toltecs believed that life, as we perceive it, is a dream. We each live in our own Personal Dream, and these come together to form the Dream of the Planet, or the world in which we live.</p> 
          <p>Problems arise when our perception of the Dream becomes clouded with negativity, drama, and judgment (of ourselves and others), because it’s in these moments of suffering that we have forgotten that we are the architects of our own reality and we have the power to change our Dream if we choose.</p> 
          <p>In <em>The Mastery of Self</em>, bestselling author and teacher don Miguel Ruiz Jr. takes the Toltec philosophy of the Dream of the Planet and offers you a road map to reclaiming your Authentic Self. He reveals how the tools of awareness, understanding, and unconditional love can free you from any inhibiting beliefs, stories, or ideas that are keeping you from living the best life possible.</p> 
          <p><strong>This book can help you discover who you really are at the deepest level, which often lies just beyond any conditioning or domestication you have acquired throughout your life.</strong></p> 
          <p>In addition to identifying the problem and explaining the solution in the context of his Toltec tradition, don Miguel Ruiz Jr. has included in-depth exercises throughout the book that will help you put these teachings into practice. The end result is a book that you can return to again and again.</p>

          <p>An Instruction Manual for Clear Communication</p> 
          <p>The most well known Buddhist teachers on the planet all have something in common: they are excellent communicators. This is not by accident, as the Buddha taught what are called the four elements of right speech over 2,600 years ago.</p> 
          <p>In this one-of-a-kind book, certified meditation and mindfulness instructor Cynthia Kane has taken the four elements of right speech and developed them into a modern practice based on mindful listening, mindful speech, and mindful silence.</p> 
          <p>Beginning with an illuminating self-test to assess your current communication style, this book will take you through the author’s own five-step practice that is designed to help you:</p> 
          <ol> 
           <li>Listen to yourself (your internal and external words)</li> 
           <li>Listen to others</li> 
           <li>Speak consciously, concisely, and clearly</li> 
           <li>Regard silence as a part of speech</li> 
           <li>Meditate to enhance your communication skills</li> 
          </ol> 
          <p>If you have ever felt misheard, have trouble stating how you feel, or long to have more meaningful and genuine conversations, this book can help. The simple steps outlined in this book will have a huge effect on how you communicate with others and yourself.</p> 
          <p>Communication is essential to being human, and when you become better at it, your personal truth becomes clearer, your relationships improve, and the result is that you experience more peace and harmony in your life.</p> 
          <p>Fans of Thich Nhat Hanh will appreciate the simple, clear instructions for how to transform everyday communication into “right speech.”</p> 
          <p>This book will enhance the experience of those who love The Work of Byron Katie, the principles of the Non Violent Communication Movement, and even the popular Buddhist Bootcamp.</p> 
          <p>This book is not intended to be a comprehensive study of Buddhist thought. Instead, it offers an entry point for modern people who are tired of getting into constant stress because of ineffective communication with family members, co-workers, superiors, and other important relationships.</p>

           <p>by don Miguel Ruiz Jr. Foreword by don Miguel Ruiz.</p> 
           <p style="text-align: center;"><em style="text-align: center;">Are you Using Knowledge or is Knowledge Using You?</em></p> 
           <p>Building on the principles found in his father’s bestselling book <em>The Four Agreements</em>, Miguel Ruiz Jr. explores the ways in which we attach ourselves inappropriately to beliefs and the world.</p> 
           <p>Ruiz explores the five levels of attachment that cause suffering in our lives. The levels are:</p> 
           <ul> 
            <li>Authentic Self</li> 
            <li>Preference</li> 
            <li>Identification</li> 
            <li>Internalization</li> 
            <li>Fanaticism</li> 
           </ul> 
           <p>Accessible and practical, Ruiz’s exploration invites us to look at our own lives and see how an unhealthy level of attachment can keep us trapped in a psychological and spiritual fog. He then invites us to reclaim our true freedom by cultivating awareness, detaching, and discovering our true selves. <strong><br> </strong></p>

          <p>In today’s economy, it’s more important than ever to get clear about your personal and professional goals- and to commit to a plan that will get you there.&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>The Path to Wealth: Seven Spiritual Steps for Financial Abundance, </i>multimillionaire entrepreneur and angel investor May McCarthy shares her own daily practice to help you do just that.</p> 
          <p>The first step on this journey is to welcome a new member to your financial advisory team: the all-knowing power of the universe that McCarthy affectionately calls the Chief Spiritual Officer, or CSO for short.</p> 
          <p>In part one of the book, you’ll learn how to set up and activate the seven-step daily practice.&nbsp; You’ll learn the job descriptions for both yourself and your new partner, and you’ll see that when these steps are applied on a daily basis, you will experience <i>a complete shift in your thinking about how financial wealth and abundance are created</i>.</p> 
          <p>In part two, you’ll go deeper into the practice to gain insight about your purpose, learn how to successfully navigate financial ups and downs, and overcome the fear of failure as well as eliminate old beliefs and behaviors that have kept you from experiencing the success you really want.</p> 
          <p>Best of all, the steps outlined in this book will teach you how to develop your own financial intuition, which is key to noticing and pursuing the opportunities that will present themselves once you are on this path.</p> 
          <p>Financial abundance can be a game of fun and prosperity, but only when you realize that you don’t have to do everything yourself.&nbsp; Your new partner wants to help you.&nbsp; Let May McCarthy show you the way.</p>

          <p><em>Healing Ancestral Karma: Free Yourself from Unhealthy Family Patterns</em></p> 
          <p>by Dr. Steven Farmer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HAK-Front-Cover.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-2165" style="margin: 10px;" src="http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HAK-Front-Cover-661x1024.jpg" alt="HAK Front Cover" width="370" height="574" srcset="http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HAK-Front-Cover-661x1024.jpg 661w, http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HAK-Front-Cover-193x300.jpg 193w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px"></a></p> 
          <p>Is it possible that you have inherited the karma of your family members? Could this explain why family members often go through the same trials and tribulations generation after generation? And if so, is there anything you can do to break the cycle?</p> 
          <p>Bestselling new age author Dr. Steven Farmer claims that each of us inherited karma. If you come from a long line of saints and humanitarians, your life is probably pretty sweet. However, if you are like most folks, your forbears are probably a mixed bag of the good, the bad, and the ugly. As a result, you are living with some appalling karmic consequences.</p> 
          <p>This is a book that shows readers how to free themselves from the negative cycles of the past, and how to tap into the ancient wisdom of their ancestors! He explains:</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>how to activate and awaken ancient cellular memory of interconnectedness with all beings</li> 
           <li>how to heal hereditary traits and characteristics, such as DNA and cellular memory that have compromised physical, emotional, and mental health</li> 
           <li>how to explore potential past lives</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>No matter what your current spiritual philosophy or practice, you can tap into your ancestral spirit guide for guidance, teaching, and healing.</p>

          <p>Over the last fifteen years, Sunny Dawn Johnston has performed hundreds of readings for clients where she’s communicated with spirits, guides, and their loved ones who have crossed over to the other side. The constant theme she receives from all of these divine entities and loved ones is this: Love never ends; fear exists only in this world.</p> 
          <p>In her new book&nbsp;<i>The Love Never Ends: Messages from the Other Side</i>, Sunny shares a selection of true and amazing stories from her experience as a psychic medium and intuitive. These encounters with the other side prove without a doubt that the universe is full of love.</p> 
          <p>Sunny shows readers how to:</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>find and follow their personal spiritual path</li> 
           <li>learn to listen to their own inner truth and intuition</li> 
           <li>recognize and own their natural spiritual gifts</li> 
           <li>cultivate a spiritual connection with loved ones who have passed on</li>

          <p>Women often fall into the habit of putting others before themselves– partners, friends, family, children, and while they can move mountains to accomplish things for their loved ones, there can be a vacant hole left where they once held their own&nbsp;<strong><em>Warrior Goddess&nbsp;</em></strong>power. &nbsp; HeatherAsh Amara coaches women to reclaim the Warrior Goddess energy that they have lost by undergoing physical, spiritual and emotional training to unchain the inner strength inherent in every woman.</p> 
          <p><em>HeatherAsh Amara challenges women to:</em></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li><strong>Venture outside of set traditions and agendas to find what truly speaks to you</strong></li> 
           <li><strong>Combat fear and doubt with resilience and ferocity</strong></li> 
           <li><strong>Reclaim your power and vibrancy by releasing the old idea that you need something outside of yourself to feel complete (partner, children, career etc.)</strong></li> 
           <li><strong>Demonstrate your strength with compassion and fierce love.</strong></li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>HeatherAsh’s approach draws on the wisdom from Buddhism, Toltec wisdom, and ancient earth-based goddess spirituality. &nbsp;As a long-time student of don Miguel Ruiz and a world-traveler, HeatherAsh has versatile training in many different philosophies, which allows her to weave intricate threads of each of these spiritual traditions into a beautiful, cohesive tapestry.</p> 
          <p>Her teachings, interlaced with personal stories, rituals and exercises for Warrior-Goddesses-In-Training,&nbsp;encourage women to begin their own journey towards unleashing the power of their inner Warrior Goddess.</p>

          <p><em>Lead With Your Heart: Creating a Life of Love, Compassion and Purpose</em></p> 
          <p>by Regina Cates<a href="http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/lead-with-your-heart/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" style="margin: 10px;" src="http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Lead-with-Your-Heart-Cover-662x1024.jpg" alt="Lead with Your Heart Cover" width="334" height="516"></a></p> 
          <p>In&nbsp;<i>Lead with Your Heart,</i>&nbsp;author Regina Cates asks us to question our notion of what success and happiness really mean.</p> 
          <p>Through the sharing of her own personal stories as well as providing helpful meditations, questions, and exercises, Regina offers a combination of wise advice, compelling anecdotes, and practical strategies for living a life that is authentic, fulfilling, and healing.</p> 
          <p>Regina is well qualified to help others down this path.</p> 
          <p>While sitting alone on her forty-third birthday, Regina hit an emotional bottom with the realization that prior to that moment, she had been caught up in the rat race of trying to live up to other people’s expectations, and as a result, she had given away one of her most important gifts: the power of choice. Regina realized that while we can’t control other people or situations, we do have a choice in how we respond to them. Regina shows us that if we choose to act from a place of love instead of a place of fear, we make our lives and the lives of those around us better in the process.</p> 
          <p><strong>Throughout the book, Regina shares her amazing (and often heart-wrenching) stories of how she moved away from a volatile, victimized frame of mind to a place of making conscious actions and decisions from a centered, heart-driven state.</strong>&nbsp;By following along with Regina’s personal stories and practicing the exercises she’s developed, we can all learn how to choose positive, heart-centered solutions for the difficulties in our life.</p>

          <p><span style="color: #999999;">At some point in life everyone goes through difficult times: the loss of a job, illness, financial troubles, relationship difficulties, divorce, and the death of a loved one.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="color: #999999;">But is there a way to face these inevitable and often unexpected challenges without having to suffer? Is it possible to experience all the trials life may bring from a place of acceptance, curiosity, strength, and a spiritual perspective that allows you to remain connected to your joy and appreciation throughout it all?</span></p> 
          <p><span style="color: #999999;">For Pastor Mark Anthony Lord, founder of the Bodhi Spiritual Center in Chicago, living in a state of joy and appreciation no matter what is not only possible, it is actually the way God wants us to live!</span></p> 
          <p><span style="color: #999999;">In&nbsp;<em>Thou Shall Not Suffer</em>, Lord recounts the path to his own liberation from suffering and teaches that ending suffering in our lives is not about some sort of intellectual understanding; it occurs the moment we focus our attention on the healing power of self-love, acceptance, and a more expanded, deeply personal God.</span></p> 
          <p><span style="color: #999999;">Lord shares his seven-step program for facing each day with joy, possibility, and peace. Each step contains exercises designed to guide you to a new way of being in the world, one where you can:</span></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li><span style="color: #999999;">Re-envision a God who works for you</span></li> 
           <li><span style="color: #999999;">Forgive yourself and others no matter what</span></li> 
           <li><span style="color: #999999;">Quiet the voices of inner judgment and self-doubt</span></li> 
           <li><span style="color: #999999;">Find and stay true to what you really want in life</span></li> 
           <li><span style="color: #999999;">Make peace with the past and create a life full of passion</span></li> 
           <li><span style="color: #999999;">Give back to your community in a meaningful way</span></li> 
          </ul> 
          <p><span style="color: #999999;"><strong>By the end of this book you will be have all the tools&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;to leave suffering and pain behind and embrace a life of happiness and joy.</strong></span></p>

          <p><em>Living a Life of Awareness: Daily Meditations on the Toltec Path</em></p> 
          <p>by don Miguel Ruiz Jr.</p> 
          <p><a href="http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/living-a-life-of-awareness/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1220" src="http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Living-a-Life-of-Awareness-Cover-Jpeg.jpg" alt="Living a Life of Awareness Cover Jpeg" width="348" height="438" srcset="http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Living-a-Life-of-Awareness-Cover-Jpeg.jpg 807w, http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Living-a-Life-of-Awareness-Cover-Jpeg-238x300.jpg 238w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px"></a></p> 
          <p>For the first time ever, the Toltec wisdom from the Ruiz family is bound together in a book of Daily Meditations.</p> 
          <p>Readers are invited on a six-month journey of daily lessons with don Miguel Ruiz Jr. that are designed to inspire, nourish, and enlighten adherents as they travel along the Toltec path.</p> 
          <p>Drawing on years of apprenticeship under his father and grandmother, don Miguel Ruiz Jr. shares Toltec lessons on Love, Faith, Agreements, and most importantly: Awareness. The purpose of each meditation is to guide readers into a deeper understanding of his or her self, as well as the world in which we live.</p> 
          <p>In the introduction to the book, don Miguel Ruiz Jr. reminds readers that progress on the Toltec path is not measured by the acquisition of things, status, or even ideas, but rather the complete and total realization that everything in the world is perfect, exactly the way it is at this moment.</p> 
          <p>“Love is accepting ourselves just the way we are, with all of our flaws and our ever-changing belief system. You are nothing else but who you are. You are not the person you were a year ago. You are not the person you will be in a year. You aren’t even the person you think you are. You simply are, and that must be enough.” –don Miguel Ruiz Jr.</p> 
          <p>This book will have special appeal to those already familiar with his father’s books&nbsp;<i>The Four Agreements, The Mastery of Love</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Fifth Agreement</i>, as well as don Miguel Ruiz Jr.’s own book,<i>The Five Levels of Attachment</i>. It also makes a wonderful gift.</p>

          <p>by Marie D. Jones &amp; Larry Flaxman</p> 
          <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Read this book and you will never view reality the same way again!</em></p> 
          <p>Mainstream science argues that if something can’t be touched, measured, quantified, and duplicated in a laboratory, then it doesn’t exist! According to this worldview, reality is an unconscious, nonpersonal mass of matter, which leaves no room for the existence of spiritual or unexplained phenomenon.</p> 
          <p>But is that <i>all there really is to reality?</i></p> 
          <p>Marie D. Jones and Larry Flaxman don’t think so, and after reading this book, neither will you! In <i>The Grid, </i>paranormal investigators and best-selling authors Jones and Flaxman present their theory of the Grid, a divine superstructure that includes multiple levels of existence, the entirety of which make up our reality.</p> 
          <p>Imagine a towering skyscraper with numerous floors,where each floor represents a different “level” of existence. Matter, spirits, angels, ghosts, extraterrestrials, quantum physics, biology, neuroscience, religion, metaphysics—even paranormal studies—all have their place in the Grid.</p> 
          <p>And once you have an understanding of the many floors of the Grid and how they are connected, you will learn all the possible ways you can “take the elevator” to access them, such as developing your psychic abilities, deep meditation, out-of-body experiences, and even the use of psychoactive drugs!</p> 
          <p>Jones and Flaxman will show you how to release the limiting belief that “this is all there is” once and for all by exploring the Grid, expanding your awareness, and empowering your life in the process.</p> 
          <p>Reality, dear friend, will never be the same again.</p>

          <p>Founded in the twentieth century by the late spiritual teacher Ra Uru Hu, Human Design is often called the “new Astrology,” and the “intersection of science and spirituality.”&nbsp;Your Human Design chart is formulated by taking your birth date, time, and location and extrapolating specific personality traits and life paths from this convergence.&nbsp;A Human Design chart offers an astonishingly accurate guide to your personality, as well as direction and counsel on how each individual can deal with challenges in their life.</p> 
          <p>Previously, Human Design charts have been notoriously difficult to interpret and decipher, usually taking a dedicated expert to read and translate them into plain English.&nbsp;At least, that used to be the case—until now.</p> 
          <p>In<i> Understanding Human Design: The Science of Discovering Who You Really Are</i>, author Karen Curry walks you through the sometimes complex and intimidating Human Design chart with simple, direct language. You will learn about each level of Human Design, from the most basic elements of the chart to the deeper, more nuanced insights Human Design offers, all in an approachable&nbsp; and interesting way. Understand how every line, intersection, and symbol correlates to a personality trait that can directly affect your life with an experienced guide by your side.</p> 
          <p>Your personal Human Design Chart can reveal your strengths, your weaknesses, and perhaps most importantly, your potential. Prepare for repetitive difficulties that you might encounter throughout your life, and embrace the opportunity to grow as you understand your personal Human Design strategy. With author Karen Curry’s assistance and knowledge, you have a path to overcome these difficulties simply by following the directions set out in your Human Design chart, the “owner’s manual” to your life.</p>

          <p>When we are going through a difficult period in our lives or dealing with a crisis, many people will tell us things like “Everything happens for a reason” or “behind every gray cloud, there is a silver lining.” But when we’re in the midst of such periods, these age-old saying can be difficult to believe…</p> 
          <p>That’s where this book comes in: it offers proof!</p> 
          <p><em>No Mistakes: How You Can Change Adversity Into Abundance</em>&nbsp;features thirty inspiring personal stories, each contributed by a different author, that show how some of their darkest moments ultimately led to their greatest blessings, illustrating that synchronicities and miracles can be found even in the most heartbreaking situations.</p> 
          <p><em>No Mistakes</em>&nbsp;offers readers a chance to look beyond the mentality of “why is this happening to me?” and instead invites readers to ask themselves “how does this situation serve my higher good?”</p>

          <p>byTherèse Tappouni</p> 
          <p>At some point in our lives, we all experience grief:</p> 
          <p>The death of a loved one, a financial catastrophe, a debilitating illness, or the ending of a marriage. In the dark moments that follow these losses, life can seem hopeless and unbearable.</p> 
          <p>Author Therèse Tappouni knows this journey all too well.</p> 
          <p>After suffering the devastating loss of her eleven-year-old son, she ultimately came to the realization that it is possible to not only heal from grief, but to find gifts from the deepest places of despair.</p> 
          <p>The Gifts of Grief: Finding Light in the Darkness of Loss explores the grieving process and examines new ways to heal from the inside out. Couched in Tappouni’s warm and comforting prose, and steeped in examples from her own experiences with deep loss, Therèse is able to walk the reader through the grieving process, while keeping in mind that the journey will be different for every person.</p> 
          <p>Complete with guided audio mediations and journaling exercises, The Gifts of Grief&nbsp;offers a compassionate path from loss and emptiness into wholeness, teaching not only how to survive grief, but also adapt and evolve new blessings from it as well.</p>

          <p>While the road has been difficult and dark at times, Therèse Tappouni’s experiences with grief and loss have nurtured her passions for counseling, writing, teaching, and speaking about the human connection and the need for a new kind of understanding around grief. She is a licensed HeartMath® Provider, a board-certified hypnotherapist, Somatic Intuitive Training Practitioner, counselor, teacher, and most importantly, a mother.</p>

          <p><em>The Five Levels of Attachment: Toltec Wisdom for the Modern World</em></p> 
          <div> 
           <p>by don Miguel Ruiz Jr. Foreword by don Miguel Ruiz.</p> 
           <p style="text-align: center;"><em style="text-align: center;">Are you Using Knowledge or is Knowledge Using You?</em></p> 
           <p>Building on the principles found in his father’s bestselling book <em>The Four Agreements</em>, Miguel Ruiz Jr. explores the ways in which we attach ourselves inappropriately to beliefs and the world.</p> 
           <p>Ruiz explores the five levels of attachment that cause suffering in our lives. The levels are:</p> 
           <ul> 
            <li>Authentic Self</li> 
            <li>Preference</li> 
            <li>Identification</li> 
            <li>Internalization</li> 
            <li>Fanaticism</li> 
           </ul> 
           <p>Accessible and practical, Ruiz’s exploration invites us to look at our own lives and see how an unhealthy level of attachment can keep us trapped in a psychological and spiritual fog. He then invites us to reclaim our true freedom by cultivating awareness, detaching, and discovering our true selves. <strong><br> </strong></p>

           <p>Miguel Jr. has taken the lessons of his grandmother and father, don Miguel Ruiz, author of <em>The Four Agreements,</em> and discovered his own personal freedom. After decades of training, Miguel Jr. is now ready to share everything he has learned. As a Nagual, he now helps others achieve their own personal freedom.</p>

           <p><em>Your Spacious Self</em><br> by Stephanie Bennett Vogt</p> 
           <p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-681" title="spacious_self_cover" src="http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/spacious_self_cover.jpg" alt="" width="396" height="612" srcset="http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/spacious_self_cover.jpg 396w, http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/spacious_self_cover-194x300.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px"></p> 
           <p>It’s a jungle… <em>in here!</em></p> 
           <p>Behind our stress, clutter, and confusion is an infinitely spacious place one might call stillness or joy. This is our natural state of being, but we usually don’t experience it because we are caught in a web of material possessions, desires, and fears.</p> 
           <p>Our clutter often becomes like another member of the family that we feed, house, and lug around. In <em>Your Spacious Self: Clear Your Clutter and Discover Who You Are</em>, author and professional space clearer Stephanie Bennett Vogt shows us that it’s not our stuff, but the holding on to it that creates a force field of stuck-ness that clouds our perceptions and paralyzes our lives.</p> 
           <p>Clutter is not just the junk spilling out of the closet. It is any thing or thought that prevents us from experiencing who we truly are. With daily tips, meditations, and a de-cluttering checklist,<em> Your Spacious Self</em> will show you how to:</p> 
           <ul> 
            <li>Clear the clutter from your home and from your soul</li> 
            <li>Revel in your own spaciousness, a place of stillness and joy</li> 
            <li>Let go of the people, places, and things that no longer serve the joyous being that you are</li> 
           </ul> 
           <p>Radical in its message and elegant in its simplicity, <em>Your Spacious Self</em> offers a new model of clearing that combines the ancient wisdom of space clearing with the modern practicality of clutter clearing. It teaches us that clearing is not just something we <em>do</em>, but also a powerful way to <em>be</em> – one small step, drawer, or moment at a time.</p>

            <p>Change is a constant, defining characteristic of life.</p> 
            <p>Seasons change, weather changes, leaves change, and so do people. In HeatherAsh Amara’s <em>The Toltec Path of Transformation: Embracing the Four Elements of Change</em>, we are encouraged to embrace the changes in our lives and create the kind of change that we want to see in ourselves and our world.</p> 
            <p>The Four Elements- air, fire, water and earth—all carry specific properties and functions that can lead to a complete life transformation along the Toltec path.</p> 
            <ul> 
             <li>Air represents our mental body, and grants clear perceptions once we shift our focus from the negativity surrounding us to the love and gratitude that lie just below the surface.</li> 
             <li>Fire, the energetic body, gives us the opportunity to clean out the agreements, behaviors and beliefs that no longer serve us, so that we can make room for new, beneficial connections.</li> 
             <li>Water, the emotional body, encourages us to open to new things, people and experiences. By staying open, we can gracefully accept what life brings while still working to create our own changes.</li> 
             <li>Earth, the physical body, acts to nourish us from the inside out, proving again that both beauty and health start from within.</li> 
            </ul> 
            <p>It is through HeatherAsh’s carefully composed instruction and guidance that we can use the Four Elements of Change to navigate the Toltec Path into our Divine center, where comparison and judgment drop away, and we can meet ourselves as the beautiful beings that we were meant to be.</p>

            <p>Have you ever tried to wrap your head around quantum physics?</p>

            <p><em>The Big Book of Reincarnation, Examining the Evidence That We Have All Lived Before</em><br> by Roy Stemman</p> 
            <p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-705" title="big_book_reincarnation_cover" src="http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/big_book_reincarnation_cover.jpg" alt="" width="396" height="555" srcset="http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/big_book_reincarnation_cover.jpg 396w, http://www.hierophantpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/big_book_reincarnation_cover-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px"></p> 
            <p>The mystery of reincarnation has puzzled many different cultures throughout the centuries. What is reincarnation? Who will be reincarnated? What evidence is there for reincarnation? Roy Stemman’s landmark work, The Big Book of Reincarnation, is destined to become the bible of reincarnation answer seekers, as he tackles these and other tough questions about the reincarnation phenomenon.</p> 
            <p>Stemman finds fascinating examples of evidence of reincarnation in the nightmares of a Louisiana bayou boy, the past-life recall of a renowned neurosurgeon, the research of a highly respected university professor, and the unique system of governance in the mountains of Tibet, to name just a few. He examines the lives of those affected by reincarnation, such as children who can actually remember their previous lives. Instead of shying away from the skeptics, Stemman evaluates their leading theories and compares them to the findings that he has accumulated throughout his global research.</p> 
            <p><em>The Big Book of Reincarnation</em>&nbsp;is thorough, well researched, engaging, and the most comprehensive book ever published on this fascinating subject.</p> 
            <p>Readers who love Brian Weiss’s <em>Many Lives, Many Masters</em> and <em>Only Love is Real</em> will appreciate the depth of study that the author brings to this work.</p> 
            <p>Topics that have long been scoffed by skeptics, past lives and reincarnation are enjoying a revival of mainstream interest after prominent medical professionals and scientists have added their personal experiences and research to a growing chorus of proof that the afterlife is no myth for the weak minded. Neurosurgeon Dr. Eben Alexander’s book, <em>Proof of Heaven</em>, is one such example.</p> 
            <p>The truth is, a deeper exploration of the human psyche and transpersonal psychology offers a frontier for the brightest minds of our day.</p> 
            <p>Other popular books that explore these and related topics include:</p> 
            <ul> 
             <li><em>The Wheel of Life</em> by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross</li> 
             <li><em>Life After Death – The Burden of Proof</em> by Deepak Chopra</li> 
             <li><em>Life After Life: The Bestselling Original Investigation That Revealed “Near-Death Experiences” </em>by Raymond Moody</li>

            <p>No one is truly alone. Every person can, at any moment, call upon not only one Archangel but seven specific Archangels to bring blessings and protection – you just need to learn how to ask. In this instructional book, Sunny Dawn Johnston will show you how to call out to each individual Archangel, to know them by name, and to develop your own special relationship with every one of them. Sunny details the qualities, gifts, and traits of each of the seven Archangels, and in her heartwarming prose, she forms a clear picture of the abundant energy, vibration and unconditional love that each of the Archangels have for us.</p> 
            <p>Through the inspirational Nine Steps, Sunny guides the reader from a place of low vibration, pain or darkness into the healing light and everyday presence of the Archangels. She surrounds these teachings with vibrant, personal insights from her own story – including the poignant memories of when she herself first began to call out to the Archangels and opened herself to receiving their love and guidance.</p> 
            <p>Read Invoking the Archangels to learn how to call upon the Archangels with an open heart and experience transformation of body, mind and soul.</p>

            <p>An ancient mystery in todays Middle East . . . Jack Staunton, an American businessman, makes a pilgrimage to war-torn Israel in hopes of rekindling his Christian faith. While traveling with his friend Punjeeh, an ER doctor from Jerusalem, Jack acquires an ancient scroll written by the Gnostics, a mystical group of early Christians, and his spiritual quest takes an unexpected turn. The scroll makes the startling claims that the Gnostics were the original followers of Jesus, and that they retained secret knowledge of Jesus that was not included in the Bible.</p> 
            <p>With the help of the ingenious Chloe Eisenberg, a professor of Philosophy and Religion, Jack and Punjeeh navigate the dangerous terrain of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in an attempt to decipher the puzzle of the scroll and bring the Gnostics revelations about Jesus to light. Threaded with the searing realities of today’s Middle East, The Gnostic Mystery is packed with historical facts about the Christian religion. The thrilling mystery makes a compelling case that the origins of Christianity are far different than we believed . . . until now.</p>
