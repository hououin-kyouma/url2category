       <p><strong><img src="http://www.yogabydegrees.net/images/alexl.png" width="180" height="180" align="right" alt="">Alex Lehman&nbsp;</strong>started practicing yoga about five years ago when he was attending school in Columbia, Missouri. A hot yoga studio opened down the street and he thought he’d give it a try as a way to cross train. The studio combined both styles of Bikram and Vinyasa into one set sequence. After a few months he was hooked. &nbsp;He started practicing five to seven times a week and discovered the benefits of yoga, including, helping him work through depression, improving his sleep patterns, and boosting his energy. &nbsp;Getting back in shape was just an added bonus. &nbsp;Alex says it was humbling to be challenged both physically and mentally at something he could do each and every day. &nbsp;He was thrilled to find out the studio was hosting a training. &nbsp;In June of 2013 he took the plunge in to a one month intensive training. Over the next 200 hours his main focus was to find a deeper understanding of exactly why yoga affected him so positively, so he could pass that knowledge on. &nbsp;Alex is passionate about helping his students set goals and guiding them on their yoga journeys so that they can discover more peace and balance in their lives. He is very thankful for all his friends and mentors in the yoga community who encourage and inspire him in his own practice. Namaste.</p>

       <p><strong><img src="http://www.yogabydegrees.net/images/alex.png" width="150" height="150" align="right" alt="">Alex Rimmel</strong>&nbsp;is an avid runner and a mother of three energetic young boys. &nbsp;She reluctantly tried yoga a couple of years ago at the urging of a friend "to just cross train for running". &nbsp;After experiencing the work out of a life time, she was hooked. &nbsp;Friends and family started approaching Alex asking what this 'hot yoga' was and soon enough she became a cheerleader for yoga sculpt! &nbsp;Wanting to solidify the deal, Alex completed her yoga sculpt training in October, 2014. &nbsp;Alex loves the upbeat and challenging intensity of yoga sculpt. &nbsp;But she doesn't take herself too seriously--be prepared for an occasional laugh in her class! &nbsp;Alex truly believes in each and every individual and helping them achieve their fitness goals. &nbsp;Alex is also a believer in the mental benefits of yoga and hopes to make every class, not only challenging for the body but for the mind too.</p>

       <p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.yogabydegrees.net/images/Alisa.png" width="160" height="187" align="right" alt=""><strong>Alisa Cubic</strong>&nbsp;first discovered yoga on PBS Chicago TV every day after elementary school. The teacher looked so peaceful, yet strong. &nbsp;She wanted to be just like her. She dove into the spirituality of it all, and it continued through to her adult life. &nbsp;Life happened though and she found herself separated from yoga asanas until a romantic winter reunion happened in 2013 at Yoga By Degrees. Alisa decided it was time to get serious about, not just her mind and spirit, but her body as well. What better way than to get certified to teach yoga? The yoga community provided her with the space to get to know herself deeper than she ever dreamt possible, all while allowing her to be her. Alisa hopes to bring this same safe haven to her vinyasa and restorative classes: love, kindness, joy and acceptance.&nbsp;</p>

       <p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.yogabydegrees.net/images/andrea.png" width="150" height="190" align="right" alt=""><strong>Andrea Brockert&nbsp;</strong>has always had a passion for fitness. &nbsp;But it wasn’t until she discovered Yoga Sculpt that she found a way to combine strength training, cardio, core work and the ever elusive missing component from her daily routine; flexibility. After years of heavy weight training and intensive cardio, Andrea found herself exhausted on a daily basis. &nbsp;She was waking up incredibly sore with extremely tight muscles. &nbsp;She knew there had to be a better way to reach her fitness goals. She tried Yoga by Degrees about two years ago on a complete whim and immediately fell in love. &nbsp;Yoga and Yoga Sculpt became a way, not only to get an amazing physical workout but it gave her the flexibility she had never had before. &nbsp;The days of waking up in pain with little energy are gone and now she cannot wait to get to her mat to share the energy that yoga gives her with others. &nbsp;She believes that yoga should be fun and invigorating; a complete workout for the body and soul. &nbsp;Yoga heals and strengthens the body while simultaneously healing and strengthening the mind.&nbsp;</p>

       <p><strong><img src="http://www.yogabydegrees.net/images/ashley2.png" width="190" height="189" align="right" alt="">Ashley Rae Swanson&nbsp;</strong>began taking classes in 2009 and loved pushing herself physically. In 2011 she took her first Vinyassa class at YBD and added the spiritual side of yoga that changed her life. Through yoga she found a patience with herself &amp; gratitude for those around her. In 2013 she completed the first YBD Teacher Training. She is now in the studio full time and believes you are only as good for others as you are to yourself. Ashley's classes encourage students to take time to be kind to themselves. Follow your dreams to live the life you have always imagined;Yogi Mom, Yogi Wife, Yogi Life!&nbsp;</p>

       <p><strong><img src="http://www.yogabydegrees.net/images/callieann.png" width="215" height="172" align="right" alt="">Callie Ann Nordling&nbsp;</strong>hails from the mossy, low country of Hilton Head Island, SC. Trekking to Chicago to attend DePaul University’s acting conservatory (also receiving a double major in International Religious Ethics); she was introduced to yoga through a required Iyengar course in college, taught by Gabriel Halpern, and fell hard for the practice. After studying Buddhism/meditation in Japan, bicycling across the country/building houses along the way (with the organization Bike &amp; Build), and volunteering in Ecuador, she settled back in Chicago, deciding to teach yoga, the thing that kept her grounded through all the adventures. CallieAnn is passionate about helping students discover their bodies in new ways, embodying their full potential, and helping them tap into the inner and outer links. In the summer of 2015, she moved with her toddler, Caleb and husband, Matt, to southern Naperville and now teaches in the western suburbs and continues to teach in the city. &nbsp;She received a RYT 200hr certification from Yoga Now Chicago. &nbsp;She has taught Hatha, Vinyasa, and Ashtanga Yoga there for the past 7 years. &nbsp;She has also gone through Ashtanga adjustment training at Yoga Thailand, and completed the Forrest Foundational Certification with Ana Forrest in 2012. CallieAnn also assists with Teacher Trainings and teaches Forrest and various other styles/privates at the East Bank Club in Chicago. &nbsp;She is currently training to become 500 hour certified.&nbsp;</p>

       <p><strong><img src="http://www.yogabydegrees.net/images/Carmen.png" width="180" height="194" align="right" alt="">Carmen Avdiu&nbsp;</strong>has been practicing yoga for 20 years, she has practiced Bikram, and Vinyasa and really began to find peace and love in the practice when she began taking classes at YBD. It was the mind and body connection that had been missing from her practice. As a mom of two little boys and a full time job as a counselor at a high school, Carmen found yoga to be an escape from the hustle and bustle of every day life. It provided a peaceful and grounding foundation to be a better working mom, making sure to balance all of the demands that are required of both. Carmen is a graduate of YBD and has absolutely loved teaching to her friends, neighbors, students and co-workers after she completed the program. She is looking forward to being able to work with you and feels grateful for the opportunity to be able to give the gift of peace, love and gratitude through yoga. As Ram Dass states in his book, Polishing the Mirror, "Love is the doorway to oneness with all things, to being in harmony with the entire universe. This return to oneness, to a simplicity of just being, of unconditional love,is what we all long for. This unified state is the real yoga,or union".&nbsp;</p>

       <p><strong><img src="http://www.yogabydegrees.net/images/carla.jpg" width="168" height="168" align="right" alt="">Carla Canham&nbsp;</strong>began her yoga journey back in 2006 when she started taking classes to complement her practice as a collegiate cheerleader. What began as a fascination with the physical asana practice has sacredly and almost serendipitously morphed into a spiritual game-changer, allowing her to sweetly surrender both on and off her mat to the spaces in life between no longer and not yet. Carla is 200-hour certified through Yoga by Degrees Teacher Training program and has been a Yoga Alliance registered teacher since 2015. Carla’s enthusiastic approach to meeting students where they’re at and her ability to cue the body makes her classes a balanced combination of both challenging and accessible. If yoga is a journey to the Self, through the Self, then her mission as an instructor is to be a loving mirror to her students as they awaken on their own mats. &nbsp;Carla graduated from Elmhurst College in 2010 with a Bachelor's degree in English and her teaching certificate. After living overseas for a year and teaching high school English for two years after that, she made the transition to the corporate world as a copywriter and editor. She nows instructs yoga full-time, fusing together her love for teachin and inspiring literature and fitness. Carla loves reading, writing, soap-making, and nature.</p>

       <p><strong> <img width="145" type="image" height="109" class="photo-right" alt="" src="http://www.yogabydegrees.net/images/carole.jpg"> Carole Witteman&nbsp; </strong>used to play tennis competitively and needed ‘something’ to soothe her tennis elbow and growing tightness in her shoulders and hamstrings. A friend recommended trying hot yoga and after her first class, she knew she was hooked. Soon after she began practicing Yoga her tennis elbow went away, she became increasingly more flexible, and started to take her yoga practice off the mat and into her daily life. After trying her first yoga sculpt class, she fell in love with the class because it combined everything: flexibility, strength training, and cardio. She was thrilled with all of the benefits she was getting from a regular yoga practice and wanted to inspire others to make yoga a part of their lives. Outside of yoga, Carole works full time as a business analyst and enjoys spending time with her family.</p>

       <p><strong><img src="http://www.yogabydegrees.net/images/catherine.jpg" width="165" height="124" align="right" alt="">Catherine Bertini&nbsp;</strong>began her yoga journey over 14 years ago with the help of her oldest daughter who invited her to join a class. Yoga quickly became Catherine's passion and provided a much needed outlet during a difficult time in her life. &nbsp;It continues to provide meditation, spirituality and relaxation in both her Vinyasa and Yin practices.

Motivated by her discovery, she dove into the YBD 200hr yoga teacher training to deepen her knowledge and recently became certified yoga instructor. &nbsp;As an avid runner, sports enthusiast, and former dancer, Chantel believes that physical movement is the most authentic expression of one’s true self. &nbsp;Her hope as a yoga instructor is to help students embrace their unique path to finding mindfulness and peace.&nbsp;</p>

She says the description of the method sounded wrong at first to her: lights,&nbsp; loud teacher's voice and extreme heat. However, she says her interest was piqued and she somehow ended up finding herself with 50 other people in a hot sweaty room full of mirrors trying to convert their bodies into a pretzel.&nbsp; Indre says discovering yoga has changed her perspective on life helping her to not only strengthen her body, but also her mind.&nbsp;</span>

        <strong><img src="http://www.yogabydegrees.net/images/jennia2.jpg" width="150" height="225" align="right" alt="">Jenni Antonicic</strong>, is E-RYT&nbsp;500 hour certified through Yoga Alliance. She came to Yoga through asana practice at her fitness center, and got hooked on the transformative powers of this multi-faceted discipline that continues to enrich her life.&nbsp;She completed her teacher training with Vinyasa master Rolf Gates in 2009 and has been looking forward to every teaching opportunity since.&nbsp;Jenni celebrates how Yoga teaches us how to cultivate and then wisely and skillfully apply our energy, whether towards improving our downward dog, or scattering joy to all beings.&nbsp;Her asana practice emphasizes anchoring to the breath (and our sense of humor!), building strength and stability as a foundation for flexibility and expression, and the self-illumination attained through brave and honest reflection.&nbsp;The wise words of Rolf Gates, to do “a little yoga a lot”, instead of a lot of yoga every now and then, catapulted her personal practice and has become the foundation of her advice for all students.&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathe, Focus, Intention, Expression is her mantra.

        <p><strong>Julie Lomax</strong> found hot yoga in 2005 after moving back to the Chicago area. Knee and back pain forced her to stop running. Yoga not only provided a low impact workout, but actually alleviated the pain that had plagued her for many years. While initially a physical exercise, yoga became so much more. Yoga became an oasis where Julie could relax, rejuvenate, and refuel – physically, mentally, and spiritually. Besides alleviating the aches and pains, yoga has been instrumental in maintaining hormonal balance and dealing with depression. Julie has been on a journey to wholeness and wellness for nearly 10 years. Yoga teacher training was the next step in the path. Julie wholeheartedly believes something as amazing as yoga needs to be shared. She likes to set her students up for success by encouraging her students and providing the proper alignment for each posture, as well as explaining the benefits. Julie lives in Naperville with her husband and daughter. She can often be found walking or biking (sometimes even snowshoeing) at the Morton Arboretum. Julie is a 200 hour certified yoga teacher and has also received certifications to teach Yoga Sculpt and Yin Yoga.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong><img src="http://www.yogabydegrees.net/images/nosa.png" width="175" height="155" align="right" alt="">Nosa Ebomoyl&nbsp;</strong>discovered Yoga while using the p-90x, a series of home workout dvds which included yoga. He was impressed at how the body could be challenged so rigorously&nbsp;without the use of any weights. What was most inspiring to him was how with patience, breath and daily practice he could push past physical limits. A tool he uses in his personal practice, particularly in difficult balancing postures, is to silently repeat the mantra "calm down". Through this he finds that he gets into challenging postures with a little more ease, much like the calm in a storm. &nbsp;Nosa believes with each passing day we meet on our mats and we are given the opportunity to learn something new about ourselves, whether it is physical, emotional or spiritual. He strives to bring a combination of tranquility and endurance that leads to strength of mind among his students.</p>
