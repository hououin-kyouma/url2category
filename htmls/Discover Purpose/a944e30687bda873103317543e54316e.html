               <p>It’s important to know that your past, if you let it, is what enables your future.</p> 
               <p>It’s cliche to say “You can’t change the past” but clearly it’s true.</p> 
               <p>What is not cliche is that you can use your past as a platform for the future no matter what your past is like… Yes this is true, all those things that are rolled up in your past; successes, baggage, events, close calls, experiences, jobs, etc.</p> 
               <p>All of these can either help you move forward OR help you put up barriers for yourself to not move anywhere. It’s your decision!</p> 
               <p>Today we are going to choose to take steps forward, but before you going laying down on the psychologist’s couch, let’s establish that what we want to accomplish</p> 
               <p>I want you to have a productive inventory of the past that will help you evaluate your future.</p>

                <p>Thanks Lily! You Rock!</p> 
                <p>I know this is a challenge for me too. The stereotype is to “discover your passion” but why can’t people be multi-passionate? The nice thing is you don’t have to eliminate all other interests from your life, instead the goal is to choose one to focus on “for now”!</p>

                <p>Maggie, you have got to have that teaching component in what you are doing. I remember the email you sent me and just from that short interaction, I can tell that’s something that matters to you!</p> 
                <p>The good news is that teaching can be really helpful in many different careers! It can also transition really easily from from part of your career to another. I bet there are 15 or 20 things you are an expert at or know more than enough to effectively teach others. (either with an organization or on your own!)</p>

                <p>Don’t underestimate the power of these, you just might have to get creative for how you layer these in! Reading is what enabled me to get where I am in my career (not my degree). I think for faith and travel those can be components of your career (by being in a career that allows you to engage in these areas the way that you want to) OR by making these some of the central themes, for example, I know several people that have businesses that are all about travel OR the type of career/business they have allows them to do the travel they want to… These pieces probably belong in the “what do you want in your life” part of the course.</p>

                <p>Thanks for the thought-provoking questions! </p> 
                <p>For me, the common thread is problem-solving. It’s what I do, what I enjoy, and who I am. </p> 
                <p>I am a microbiology lab supervisor, solving problems and finding solutions for my team and for my clients daily. However, I also spend a good bit of my free time volunteering, primarily working with one organization that provides creative workshops for at-risk teens and fundraising with another organization to benefit local programs and services for homeless and at-risk teens. I’ve absolutely been loving getting to tackle and learn social media, fundraising, event planning and promotions, and my own leadership abilities through these experiences. These are all tools I’m adding to my arsenal! </p>

                <p>Ahh… Problem solving huh? me too… it’s kind of a sickness. So if it’s a big part of who you are then in what environments, what situations in the past, and how else do you most enjoy problem solving? If we were doing one on one coaching, I would ask you to take it a step further and really dig into “what circumstances do you most enjoy problem solving AND what portions of problem solving do you offer the biggest value to others? </p> 
                <p>Thanks so much for your comment! I Love what you are doing as a volunteer BTW!</p>

                <p>No joke this is really hard. I am struggling with looking at what I have done for work and finding things I like/liked doing. I am a helper. I love building relationships with others by solving issues though it has been in a technical capacity my whole career (I am in I.T.) I want my future to include helping and solving problems in a more personal nature and not in I.T. anymore. I wouldn’t mind teaching but again nothing technical. </p>

                <p>Kim, You are right, this is difficult and if it wasn’t everybody would have it figured out already. Go for simple: break it down into the smallest things that you enjoyed in the past, If you are a helper, what does that mean? What areas did you like helping in? Remember it’s the little things. </p> 
                <p>For example 10 years ago I used to be a General Manager for a franchise company and the little things I enjoyed were when I would be working with people and I helped them get a new concept or idea. OR when I could see that small things we had been working on together had led them to success OR every time someone would tell me “I never imagined that I could do that 3 months ago”. </p> 
                <p>The funny thing is that these are still things that I love even though I’m not doing that same work today. It fits right in with this business and other jobs I have had recently. </p> 
                <p>Find those small things that just make you smile or you get lost in. If you start to string these small things together in other work, then it starts to make a difference. </p> 
                <p>So… What types of problems do you like to solve, If not technical teaching, then what types have you enjoyed? what small things did you like about teaching?</p> 
                <p>Go deep now! It’s worth it later!… but you called it right the first time… it’s difficult.</p>

                <p>I found and realized that I am most happy when organizing events and then being at events as the overseeing person, making sure it all works. As I have an experience with this already, my dream job would be a hotel event manager. Having people around, figuring out the complexity of such event and then seeing how it all plays well together – that would be the best work I could do. I am very confident at putting any kind of event together, no matter how big or small and then facilitating it, however, I don’t have a hotel industry experience on that level, only front desk.

                <p>Ingrid, That’s awesome that you know this about yourself! If you have professional experience with this already it should not be that much of a stretch to do it in the hotel industry… (BTW what is it about the hotel industry that makes you want to be there? Would you consider the same thing in another industry?) How you represent the experience you do have will be the key AND allowing yourself to get over the mental barriers of not perfectly having the “exact” experience that is on a job posting. </p> 
                <p>I would suggest beginning to build relationships with people who can make those hiring decisions in the hotel industry where you want to be AND reaching out to people who are already doing what you want to be doing. Ask them if you can take them to coffee so you can learn more about their job/role because you are interested. The network of people in this industry is smaller than what you might realize and they can probably create an introduction for you other people that can help you “break in”. Don’t meet with them expecting that to happen though, instead meet with them to learn more about them, how they got where they are, and to build a new relationship. You will be surprised what will happen!</p>

                <p>Hi Scott, thank you for your feedback, it sounds really good.<br> Why hotel industry is so appealing to me? Well, hotels generally have an atmosphere of excitement. People come to hotels for a short time, either for vacation or a business trip, in any case, such visits are always connected with fun, with new experiences, change of environment and travel. When you have to learn even the hardest thing on the planet, but you go and learn it in a completely new city in a high-end hotel, that makes your learning way much easier and fun, right? So, for me the hotel industry is an industry of change, travel, new places, excitement, discovery and challenge. And because I love all of these things, I would feel as fish in the water there. And when we’re happy at what we’re doing, we do things great and much much better.<br> So, I will go on LinkedIn and start connecting with hotel people. I might also call up some hotels and talk to some decision makers directly and try to get their 15 minutes and charm them away with what I can do and offer to them. BTW, I was able to do that today by calling a Chief Operating Manager in one of the biggest Yoga Studios in Canada. She did book her 15 minutes with me, so thank you. 🙂<br> Does this sound OK to you?<br> Thanks for all your tips and advice and I will keep on sharing my further successes with you guys. :)))</p>

                <p>This exercise made it very clear to me that I enjoy performing and speaking to large groups of people more than most other things. I’m a musician, so this makes sense, I’ve just never thought of myself as such a performer or realized that I am truly happy when in the spotlight. I’ve always thought of myself as the quiet, behind the scenes type in my career, but in looking at my past experiences this really is not the case. I really enjoy leading and performing! </p>

                <p>Cathy, For some reason these questions always cause me to learn something about myself too. Every single time I read them! Even if just something small. </p> 
                <p>I am predisposed to be an introvert but most people wouldn’t know it because, like you, I’m very comfortable (and happy) in the spotlight. THE GREAT NEWS: You can do an awful lot of fun things that allow you to be in the spotlight. Coaching, Teaching, Speaking, Training, Performing every single one can be done for a variety of topics and interests. Also all of these can be done both for entertainment purposes OR to help people solve problems. Make sure whatever you do that it allows you to “perform” or be in the spotlight regularly!</p> 
                <p>I’m looking forward to seeing what decision you come out of this course with!</p>

                <p>These questions confirmed to me my enjoyment in helping or more specifically enabling people to help themselves. I have had a lot of mental health issues and still do ADHD, PTSD and the depression that comes with them. If I’ve learnt one thing about myself its that I’m resilient, oh and and inspite of of everything life has thrown at me I can still love people and not get bitter. I want to put my life knowledge to good use and get into mental health nursing or social work. Oh and I’m 56 and everyday is still a learning day.</p>

                <p>Carol, I love that you have such a great outlook no matter what the circumstances. It seems like that is truly one of the “keys to success” (or insert another cliche here) but seriously no matter how large or small anybody’s problems are you can find either excuse to stop OR opportunity. Great job choosing opportunity. As you go through this course, I would encourage you to even look at more non traditional ways that you can help these people. I have friends in social work and know some people in mental health nursing and it may or may not be the right fit for you (the rest of this course will help you with that) Great job being honest with yourself!</p>

                <p>Kevin, this is great that you know this and is a perfect place to start but I’m going to guess you don’t like to learn just anything at all. What do you like to learn about more than other things. This will start to give you clues. Remember learning without application isn’t really learning at all. I also love to learn and have been paid to attend many seminars, classes, conferences, presentations and flown all around while staying in nice hotels to do it, but unless you see some results coming from all that know somewhere it is the equivalent of spending all your time watching tv…. which would be fun for a while but not very fulfilling long term…. So you now know that whatever you’re doing does need to have the opportunity to learn… and that’s a start!</p>

                <p>This exercise made me realize that I like to use my skills in helping benefit others. I found that in my past, I have always been the person to help out another. I would always focus on the teams efforts, rather than just myself. I enjoy helping people feel like their best selves, and understanding that what I am doing has meaning. I am currently in the fashion industry, designing clothes. I would love to use my skills in fashion to help people feel and look their best, from a styling standpoint. Help them understand that they can look ash feel good. I just don’t know how to do that exactly?</p>

                <p>Theresa, I love this! There are plenty of ways that you could do exactly that. The very most options will be if you have your own business or build your own thing (High end fashion consultant, Fashion and style expert for ____ fill in the blank with an online business, ) We help people all over the world learn to find what they value and build a life around it with their work, there is no reason you couldn’t use fashion to help people look and feel their best… now if you wanted to work with someone else there are plenty of niche companies popping up left and right that need your skillsets some of them have on staff stylists and experts for their customers. </p> 
                <p>I say all this, NOT to try to force you toward one of these options but instead to help you realize that there are many more options than the traditional fashion industry. they don’t have the everyone for themselves culture either 😉</p>

                <p>Without much surprise, i rediscovered my joy in organizing chaos into order. I enjoy and am good at doing this both on a physical level as well as in visual design. I’ve been called “the most organized person i know” by more than one person and am happy that i find joy in it as well, even if it’s daunting at first. This skill is essential in the career path i have chose (though want to change), so i’m not sure, aside from personal organizer where i might be beneficial out in the workforce. I also like to help people feel their best. I am a long-time yogi, a certified massage therapist and an animal lover. Read: nurturer. Also, I’m very resourceful and like the challenge of finding great resources for myself and others. People trust me with all of these things it seems.</p>

                <p>You might need to look at smaller businesses where you get to wear more hats. </p>

                <p>Jesse, I’m glad you enjoyed it! I wonder if you could actually combine those together. That would make for pretty cool business. There are many different ways you could get to incorporate these in your life though where you get paid for one or both!

                <p>In the past, I worked for a nonprofit organization with a strong mission for supporting and encouraging adults with severe disabilities. On days when I felt ineffective in my work or disillusioned with our approaches, I knew I could still exit my office and live the mission by being a mentor and a friend to our clients. It is important for me to cultivate more opportunities to help others to achieve their dreams and I am looking for a workplace that places equal value in a greater social purpose.</p>

                <p>One thing that I have gone through that I would really love to help others outgrow is the cycle of obsession and rumination that our minds manufacture, leading to exhaustion and perpetual anxiety. In understanding how our minds work and what healthy steps (albeit difficult ones) to take, this problem can be dealt with so that people can be more present and live full lives. I have a deep, experiential understanding of these issues and I think I could be of assistance to others in this area.</p>

                <p>Thanks for the response Scott, exactly my thinking as well. I was listening to your podcast with Stephanie O’Brien yesterday which was helpful with this. The hard part, as she described, was that this type of business is not selling a material product. Selling yourself is a much different, and perhaps much less simple, undertaking.</p>

                <p>I want to take forward the memory of some terrible management techniques (or behaviours) that I have been exposed to so that I never make those mistakes myself, and also remain aware of what people may have experienced that makes managing them difficult.<br> What is it about doing self development that just makes you want to help others do the same? I would never have considered trying to work in this industry before but it is so inspiring, like finding and opening a treasure chest inside, that it’s tempting. Looking forward to finding if my skills and strengths aline with this passion, or if my future lies elsewhere! Thank you Scott and HYTC!</p>

                <p>A treasure chest huh? I hadn’t considered that but it’s fairly accurate. Except that it feels more like I get to open up the treasure chest and just start handing out the goods….

                <p>Shane, If that is important to you, you should do exactly that and not sacrifice on it! I find that for me I don’t want to do anything small. My “best I can” is usually making and doing “stuff” worth doing and using! I want to make truly helpful things that people are so excited about they share and talk about with their friends!

                <p>The one thing in my past that I would like to include in the future is my sense of accomplishment through social progression. In saying that, I want to continue to ascend and grow professionally at an even faster rate than I did when I was at adolescence. I want to increase and assimilate values of life using brand new life experiences as I did when I was a young person accomplishing new feats for the first time. I’d like to learn with experiences all over again without the blatant innocence of a grade school child.

Taking something like yucky furniture and giving it a new life, grooming animals, fixing women nails and giving them cool nail art, changing the color on walls, creating useful products from scraps of wood and leather. I like to physically see the difference I can make through my own creativity.</p>

                <p>Right on Roger! That’s a big motivator and driver for me too! We have little kids (age 4,6 and 8) and I want them to understand you do not have to tolerate “someone else’s version” of what life should look like! It’s that sense of purpose like you have identified right there Roger, that will help you move past the scary and difficult parts! Thanks for letting us play a part in your journey!</p>

                <p>if I were to stop living today, I would regret that I didn’t try to make myself happy, instead of worrying about everyone else. I stay in a situation because it is easy (sometimes), familiar, convenient. I turned down potential opportunities because there was a lot of change-moving far from family, traveling, etc because the change was too scary. I didn’t think I could handle a new job, new responsibilities and now living on my own, alone, away from family</p>

                <p>This is a common one! Change is scary but you don’t get to do extremely fulfilling and enjoyable things in your life without being a little scared! You can do it, yes it will be hard… but you can do it! more importantly… it will lead you to things and experiences that you can’t even imagine right now.</p>

                <p>The one item that I have in my past that I want to include in my future is helping/developing others. That is something that I liked doing since I joined the Navy and it continues today. One of the things that I am doing today that I haven’t done in the past is self-development. In the past, I believed that the company I worked for was responsible for my personal and professional development. In the past couple of months, I finally realized that this is my responsibility. Another item that I regret in the past is the I gave up leadership positions because I thought that I didn’t deserve it. Now I know better.</p>

                <p>I would like to help people to release from their own chains by teaching them (or guiding them, I prefer) how to focus on joy, pleasure and happiness. This could be through sensorial experiences, wellbeing, outdoor activities, spirituality, etc. I haven’t figured out yet how to do it, but this is what I want 🙂</p>

                <p>Romina, This could definitely be a lot of different areas. Truly this is the core of what we do. I would pick an area that you have experience in, you don’t have to be an expert but you do have to have to know more than the people you would help (which my 6 year old says is the definition of expert anyways!) Then, what specific problem would you help them solve in that area?</p>

                <p>45 years of real-world experience in life and business, has taught me that it´s all about people! People is the heart and soul of any venture in life and business – people and ventures is a contact- and a team-sport. People meeting people can lead to the most fantastic accomplishments with extraordinary and sustainable outcomes… these people are those who dare to be true to themselves, dynamic in perspective and collaborative in approach to the the outside world. I believe that a strong personal leadership and being an authentic authority of oneself, makes it possible to grow authentically with other people. The learnings of yesterday makes me want to do two things tomorrow: 1. mobilize people with creative pursuits around common purpose, goals and projects, Inspire them for action, and run them up the hill. 2. Encourage any individual I meet on my life-journey to live a self-actualized life on their own terms</p>

                <p>Thanks for replying Scott! Well, thats exactly what I hope to find someone out there who can help me with determining, and the reason for me seeking inspiration from you, amongst others. As much as I understand everything about my self (in past and presence), what talents I can bring into the future and even how, as much doubt I have as to what path is the right one to follow and how to marketize myself. I hold an excellent ability to create emotional long-term and meaningful and trust-based relationships with other people. I am also an ideator who love to give life to ideas and turn strategy into action. As a business intra-preneur I have spend 18 years stepping into companies to develop business. Now I feel like an expert in stepping in to any company and spot the needs, paradoxes, dilemmas, problems, potential, opportunities, identify sustainable solutions, create simple executable plans, and implemented them. So…I am well aware the context in which I should pursue work being my own entrepreneur (mentor, co-pilot,, trusted advisor, interim leader etc), but I have no clue as to what content to offer, what specific problems to solve out there, and for who excatly. Could potentially be helping startups becoming commercially strong and centered around a sustainable culture, structure and proces, could be helping people grow authentically and help them mobilize the courage and actionpower to change… I am searching for clues.</p>

                <p>I still don’t have this pinned down yet. I know that I feel great when I am doing something to make someone or something better…but there are a lot of things that I am passionate about that don’t necessarily equate with sustainable work. For instance, I know that I feel very strongly when I hear sad stories about children growing up in bad situations, and also am very concerned with preservation of the environment/wildlife….but I don’t know the first step to making a career where I would actually be able to support my family out of either one of these passions. The other things that I enjoy in my current/prior work are organizing, research, writing and problem solving, that are employable skills, but I don’t know how to tie these in with my passions above.</p>

                <p>I was sexually abused and traumatized through my life, but that isn’t something I can help others with. Since it is something so personal and so varied, there is no one size fits all situation. Every time I tried to help others, it didn’t end up going well because there are a lot of other things involved with getting over something so massive. That community is always so on the defensive and not willing to change. Hence the embracing of Stoicism.</p> 
                <p>I really have no other answers to those questions. Blank slate. After looking and dealing with my past, there really isn’t anything in the future either. A positive, for sure, but a blank slate all the same,</p>

                <p>Awesome Beth!. we help a lot of people that love learning. Depending on the context of why you enjoy learning (and what that means for you) you will want to find an environment that places value on that. For Example: Sometimes startups need you to continuously learn and figure out things on your own and they value your ability to do that – So if you’re a really structured learner that may not be good, but if you get joy out of learning and applying immediately to see results, then that could be a great environment.</p>

                <p>I’d like to bring back from my past my bravery to start something new and take a bit of a risk. When I was 17 I took a huge risk and joined the army, best thing I did with my professional life (learned lots of life skills, practical skills, and a free college education). Since I’ve left the army I’ve become a bit risk adverse to these big life changing career choices. I’d like to get back to bold choices.</p>

                <p>I did not finish yet the 10 questions. However I can say when I was young, I was reading more than now and I was writing too. I would like to go back to writing but this time to talk on social and political facts: injustice, social inequalities, violence, democracy, and also propose new ideas in these fields, etc. I’d like to write both in French and in English.</p>

                <p>Awesome Richard! I’m very sure that if that’s important to you, you can make that happen! As you get further along in this process ask yourself, “where and when do I enjoy creating these teachable moments the very most?” Prioritizing the most fun experiences to the top will give you the best clues.</p>

                <p>Thanks, Scott. That is easy – anywhere it happens :). That isn’t very limiting, but it is reality. I have enjoyed it teaching preschoolers in Sunday school, middle schoolers in school, high schoolers and adults in conversation and Bible studies, adult volunteers in trainings, college grads in mock interviews, and professionals on my team I am coaching in their professional growth. It is a bit addictive – in a good way!</p>

                <p>Major kudos for working (and it is work) on overcoming the trauma in your past – so many ppl get lost in their trauma. Perhaps the reason you don’t see “future” is because you are still in the healing process? Maybe you just need some time in a neutral holding pattern while? </p>

                <p>I plan to bring back my non-fiction writing – I adore researching and diving into a new subject and then making it come alive via words and images for the reader. When I was younger, I was shy and awkward and doubted my value – when my brother was killed in 9/11, I went thru massive shifts and realised that I really didn’t care enough about “what they think” to hide myself anymore – that most of my fears were about giving a nameless “them” all my power. There are a few valued people in my life who’s opinion of me I care about – and those people never judged or doubted me as harshly as I did myself. So as a 30-something grown-up I became publicly brave, and I’ve had 15 years developing it – I’ll keep that! 🙂</p>

                <p>I used to love Japanese. I was an outstanding student, and Japanese was ‘my’ subject. I was the expert. I knew all through highschool and university that I would live in Japan and be a translator. Then I went there on exchange. And it was… good (it was great, but I have a number of negative experiences which may well be blinding my vision), and I guess I realised I was no longer the ‘expert’ being amongst all the native speakers. I realised I wanted to live and work back in my hometown.</p> 
                <p>I came back, and I sort of gave up on Japanese. I told myself I didn’t like the working culture required of it and just could not get over the honorifics in the language (using distancing language in order to show respect in Japanese, as opposed to closing the distance to show friendship and rapport in English). And so here I am in admin/reception type roles.</p> 
                <p>That last question, for some reason, the fact that I gave up Japanese just struck me, and I can’t for the life of me think of anything else, as in the past year I’ve accomplished two other life goals, marriage and travel to the UK. It doesn’t make sense, but it’s kind of scary to think perhaps I’d be happier pursuing Japanese again…</p>

                <p>I like writing and once did some paid writing. I get satisfaction out of messing with data and getting an answer. I like organizing people and teams. I like educating others in health and fitness. I love travel and certainly want to have some flexibility for that.</p>

                <p>Pretty much what came up over and over again, was working with Horses, which is something I did more in my past, and travel. I have no idea how to incorporate both things, as well as with my professional training as a social worker. I love helping people and problem solving, but am getting burnt out by the revolving door that is social work. How do I effect more change with my clients? How do I involve other things I am passionate about? It’s tough. I also love cooking, music, hospitality, planning, dreaming, executing a vision, problem solving is a big one, and clarifying communication/conflict resolution. How does it all fit together?</p>

                <p>One thing from the past I’d want to involve in my future is to give my voice and presence to the service of others through different kinds of channels – television, radio, podcasts, voice overs, event hosting, etc. I have done a lot volunteering for my local tv station, and all the interviews I made and all the stories and events I covered were the best experiences I’v had in my life.

                <p>I loved, loved, loved taking voice over lessons, which culminated in making a voice over demo tape that I was then too afraid to do anything with. It was GOOD but I let fear of rejection get in the way of pursuing my dreams of talking for a living. Talking for a living is my reoccuring theme, and I need to heed that calling.</p>

                <p>Hi Mike. I would say that seeing the excitement and enthusiasm in the faces (as well as their actual verbal and written feedback) was gratifying. Their enthusiasm had much to do with fact that the event was an honoring/commemoration of a childhood author that was and is important to so many people (including me and my co-producer, of course). And the fact that it was a completely unique event that nobody else had ever done. This was more gratifying than the commercial photo shoots that I produce, for which I actually earn money. (In other words, the event, which has happened 4 separate times, is not a money-making venture).</p>

                <p>I would do a similar event with another author, if I could team with others to produce it. So far, I have not been able to (or really even attempted to) monetize this – it was a labor of love. I mention it because it was something that was gratifying and fun so would be interesting to find out if there is a career/company in which similar events were at least one element of the job description.
