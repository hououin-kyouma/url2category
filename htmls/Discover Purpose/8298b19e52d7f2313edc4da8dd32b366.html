       <p>It all began on a Cub Scout outing to West Point. Ernie and a friend soon lost interest in the military formality, and Ernie said, <span id="green-font">"I'm going to climb that mountain."</span> The Scoutmaster said, "Yeah, go ahead." Several hours later a patrol was sent to find them. Turned out the area was rattlesnake infested and covered with poison ivy. The boys made it to a ridge - and were already at the gate when found...and they avoided the PI. Ernie loved the adventure and the exhilaration of the climb- a feeling he's never lost. <span id="green-font">To this day, he, "climbs that mountain" whenever he can.</span> </p>

       <p>Ernie loved to share his adventures with others - especially the kids. He was a counselor at Camp Highlander, North Carolina (owned by the Pine Crest School in Ft. Lauderdale.) Ernie had to work in the kitchen to earn his way to become a counselor. He finished his kitchen chores as fast as possible, so that he could spend his afternoon exploring and rock-climbing. </p>
       <p>As a counselor Ernie took ten year-olds on their first hike, introducing them to a world he loved. They made their own campsite with a few tarps and learned to think creatively to secure them from the wind and rain. Of all the groups, Ernie's were the most proficient in difficult conditions. <span id="green-font">"I taught them like I like to learn: on my own. Left with a task, it's amazing how naturally creative the kids were in finding their own solutions." </span> </p>
       <p>Ernie looks at an extreme adventure as, "Risk Management - the same thing I do with stocks and investing." Learn the rules before you play the game. </p>

       <p>To ski Mt. Baldy bowl is - for most - an extreme adventure. The Sierra Club ski hut is at 8,200' and the summit at 10,064.' The mountain creates its own weather. The skiing is exceptional - if you can do the climb to get to it. It's almost 4,000 vertical feet up -- and 2,000 feet down. </p>

            <p>"A favorite client of mine taught me the power and freedom that comes from passive income (money working for you) and investing in the Stock Market. In the ten years I worked with him, he never earned less than 30% in his stock portfolio. <br><br> Remember the "Tech" crash? My client missed it. He made $250,000 on one stock and option trading - on an investment of $20,000. 2001 was a good year for him! <br><br> I soon discovered that Ernie Back was the brilliant mind behind his investment strategies. My client at that time was in his mid 70's -- and open to learn what works. Ernie Back was his guide and teacher. Although my client was an astute businessman, his real wealth came from the stock market -- and so has mine. <br><br> I still follow the same basic principals with similar success. I need a guide to venture into the wilderness of options and commodities trading - and that was a key to my clients success. <br><br>Over the years I discovered Ernie's photography, his love of the wilderness and interest in theatre...but his greatest skill? Communication! He has a real talent for explaining the basics, and cheerfully guiding the (often eccentric) wealthy into profitable opportunities." Cheryl Janecky, Malibu, California</p>

       <p>Many other countries have had Ministers of Art or Culture for centuries. This country needs to support the arts--now more than ever. Please take a moment to <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/esnyc/petition.html">sign the petition </a> and then pass it on. Thanks! </p>

At 9 years old his <span id="green-font">Vision was becoming a concert pianist.</span> That passion led to incredible (and magical) Opportunities, more Inspiration- and today he performs in a variety of venues, often with his jazz group PocketWatch. </p>
       <p>PocketWatch performs as a classic jazz trio when performing standards, but the main configuration of the group is six instruments, and plays only Gerry's original, contemporary jazz and classical music. </p>
       <p><span id="green-font">He lives his Vision, performing and recording regularly,</span> both solo and with his jazz group, in clubs and studios. He also composed, arranged and performed music for a documentary by an Academy Award winning filmmaker. </p>

       <br> Gerry's classical training began in childhood, 
       <p></p>
       <p>beginning with the noted Cleveland, Ohio music teacher Ethel Morton, </p>
       <p>and then continued at Phillips Andover Academy with the acclaimed German concert pianist and teacher, Albion Metcalf. </p>
       <p>Gerry graduated cum laude from Andover, the first black to do so. </p>
       <p>Although music training was offered, the <span id="green-font">primary focus was academic and college preparation. He continued his classical studies with a scholarship to Harvard.</span> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </p>
       <center>
        "Being yourself is not remaining
        <br> what you were, or being satisfied
        <br> with what you are.
        <br>
        <br> It is the point of departure."

       </center> 
       <p></p>
       <p>Harvard’s music program was limited to classical, and Gerry felt Inspired to explore other styles. He continued his music education on his own and changed his major to business - to prepare for dealing with the business side of the music industry. </p>
       <p>Gerry performed in Jazz, R&amp;B, and rock groups on the east and west coasts, tutored by and performed with such <span id="green-font">Jazz greats as Dizzy Gillespie and Les McCann,</span> and he has accompanied such Broadway musical stars as <span id="green-font">Dale Kristien</span> ("Phantom of the Opera") and Carl Anderson ("Jesus Christ Superstar.") </p>

       <p>He graduated from <span id="green-font">Harvard cum laude</span> and moved to Los Angeles, the Entertainment Capitol of the world. Attending UCLA on scholarship, he received his J.D. and M.B.A., simultaneously, from UCLA. </p>
       <p><span id="green-font">In Entertainment Law,</span> Gerry found what he wanted: Not fighting (as an adversarial trial lawyer) but <span id="green-font">bringing parties together, as a transactional Lawyer – negotiating deals.</span> Gerry's natural inclination is negotiating to create good projects.

       <p>Gerry represents artists of all disciplines, arts organizations and businesses of all sizes; and writes a weekly newspaper column on business and legal issues in entertainment and the arts. </p>

       <h4><span id="green-font">Sounds like a typical,<b> “Rich Get Richer…” story</b> doesn’t it? Hardly the case.</span> </h4> 
       <p></p>
       <p>Here’s the real story of a dream leading from poverty to opportunity and a first class ticket to the best life has to offer. </p>
       <p>Most of the rich now living lives they love - started with nothing but a Desire and a Vision, an open mind, love of learning, willingness to work with others – and the passion to do - "whatever it takes." </p>
       <p><span id="green-font">Gerry Bryant’s Good Fortune Inspired journey - begins in the ghetto on Cleveland's east side.</span> It's a path of balancing opposing lifestyles, choices and opportunities. </p>
       <p></p>
       <center>
        “The ability to hold two opposing ideas 
        <br> in mind at he same time 
        <br> and still retain the ability to function 
        <br> is the sign of a first-rate intelligence.” 
        <br> 
        <h5>F. Scott Fitzgerald</h5>
       </center> 
       <p></p>
       <p>Even as a child, Gerry found himself balancing between opposing views, what he desired, and what others valued. Balancing between opposite worlds is tough - but possible. </p>
       <p>When faced with leaving his loving family and all he knew - for the austere opportunity to live his dream in an elite all-male boarding school - he said, "Yes." That becomes balancing between living the lifestyles and values of the very rich, and the very poor, and between those cultures. </p>
       <p>When Gerry was confronted with two paths – appearing to lead in opposite directions – he said “yes to both” music and law. </p>
       <p>When Inspiration led to other styles of music - and changing his lifelong passion for classical - he said, "Yes." You can have it all. Was it easy? Here’s the story. </p>

Neither his young age – nor the piano- is as amazing as <span id="green-font">Gerry's passion for classical music.</span> Few in Cleveland’s ghetto shared his vision. </p>

       <p>Phillips Andover Academy and Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire (Andover and Exeter were founded in the 1800s by feuding brothers) are considered the Harvard and Yale of secondary schools, i.e., the best of the best.<br><br> Except for the ten black students, all were very, very rich white kids.<br><br><b> Sound like a dream come-true?</b> </p>
       <p><span id="green-font">Be careful of what you wish for – it might come true:</span> The difference in lifestyles was huge. Now he was one of 900 in a wealthy, restrictive, disciplined and ordered environment: Coat and tie uniform, set schedules – and isolated in the tiny rural town of Andover. </p>
       <p>For a 13 year old who had been a big man on a co-ed campus in a public middle school – in the band, president of his class, girlfriends, and the brightest academically – <span id="green-font">it was culture shock</span> – to say the least. </p>
       <p>Gerry recalled, “One of the biggest differences was the classroom size. In public schools there were 40 or so in a class – and lots of time to socialize while the teacher disciplined and attempted to maintain order enough to teach. In Andover, there were 5-7 in a class – with ONE instructor. </p>
       <p>All time spent was serious learning – a very different environment – and no choice but to "fit the mold." He missed out on the fun things – no prom or dating or sports after school with friends. It was an intense three years with no slack. </p>
       <p>Gerry withdrew into his music and studies. They were his ticket to financial freedom. An aspiring concert pianist – he give recitals – trained, attended competitions, was in the orchestra, band (drums) and learned tennis. </p>
       <p><span id="green-font">Gerry was the first black to graduate cum laude – from Andover, and he received a scholarship to Harvard. </span> </p>

       <p>Once in Harvard he dropped his interest in exclusively classical piano, and began to explore other types music. Composition was now more important – he began <span id="green-font">writting music in ernest.</span> His new music interests were pursued on his own. </p>
       <p>Harvard – not known for music – had a limited program so Gerry switched to pre-law – in order to learn the business side of a music career. Gerry formed a band and played locally - performing at clubs – with the Kuumba Singers, Harvard's Black Gospel Choir – and for theatre groups, Gerry wrote music for plays. <span id="green-font">He graduated cum laude and transfered to the West coast.</span> </p>

       <p>He became a<span id="green-font"> vegetarian on a dare</span> – 15 yrs ago. His sister said, “Life's better because I stopped eating meat. Bet you can’t go one week without eating red meat.” Gerry took the bet, did it – won the bet – and asked himself, “Wonder how much longer can I keep this up?” </p>
       <p>A love relationship (also a vegetarian) led him on new spiritual paths of self exploration. Gerry met his percussionist at Science of Mind - also on a spiritual path of self growth.

       <p>His advice to artists? Join CLA and get the information you need to protect your creative works. Use a lawyer at the start – many scenarios can go wrong – protect your interests in the beginning – then do your creative thing without worry. Once you have success, then people come to sue – and it’s too late: You can’t get the insurance after the fact. </p>

       <p><span id="green-font"><strong>George Soros,</strong></span> in support of democratic societies and intellectual freedom, gave billions of dollars to over 30 countries. </p>
       <p>Multimillionaire pop star <span id="green-font"><strong>George Michael</strong></span> has decided to give away his music for free, posting it on the Internet for anyone to download. "I've been very well remunerated for my talents over the years," he told BBC,"so I really don't need the public's money." </p>
       <p>Hollywood movie and music mogul <span id="green-font"><strong>David Geffen,</strong></span> the billionaire cofounder of DreamWorks told Forbes, "I have no interest in making money anymore. Everything I make in the entertainment business will go to charity." </p>
       <p>CNN founder and billionaire<span id="green-font"><strong> Ted Turner</strong></span> is in the middle of a 10-year, billion-dollar giveaway to the United Nations. Since 1997, he has been donating annual installments of 100 million dollars, specifying that they not be used for administration costs but for programs like eliminating land mines, feeding children, and preventing disease. </p>
       <p>And who is the greatest philanthropist of all time?<span id="green-font"><strong> Bill Gates</strong></span> has given billions to improve conditions around the world – and recently <span id="green-font"><strong>Warren Buffett</strong></span> (worlds richest man) contributed more billions to Gates’ foundation.

       <p><span id="green-font"><strong>Oprah Winfrey </strong></span> in 2007 is at the top of the Giving Back Fund list of the 30 most-generous celebrities for the second consecutive year. This year she gave $50.2-million to causes related to education, health care, and advocacy for women and children through her foundation and Oprah’s Angel Network. </p>
       <p>Oprah is the only star who qualified for one of the Top 50 most generous philanthropists. She's also the first African American philanthropist to land on the list, contributing $175 million in 2003 to educational initiatives at home and abroad. And with her Angel Network - in which 100% of audience donations go to nonprofits - she's inspiring her fans to follow in her charitable footsteps. </p>

       <p>She has worked with field staff from the UN refugee agency and met with refugees and internally displaced people in more than 20 countries on five continents. </p>
       <p>In June 2008, Angelina Jolie issued special messages to mark World Refugee Day. She also continues to bring attention to some of the globe’s biggest humanitarian crises, from Iraq to Chad and Sudan’s Darfur region. <br><br> Jolie recently gave $1 million to the U.N. to aid Afghan refugees and pledged $5 million to set up a wildlife sanctuary in Cambodia. </p>

It will also support a library and archival program of international African women research and resources at the Academic Center. </p>
       <p>Their philanthropy also includes a $1.3 million gift to Fisk University in 1986; another $1.3 million divided equally among four other Black universities--Central State, Howard, Florida A&amp;M and Shaw--in 1987; and $1.5 million divided between Meharry Medical College ($800,000) and Bethune-Cookman College ($750,000) last year. </p>

       <h4>Giving gifts is an ancient custom, shared by all cultures and people. </h4>

       <p>Giving comes not only from the famous and wealthy. Most non-profit causes rely on funds from many sources - mostly from the general public and small donations. </p>
       <p>Think you can't afford to donate? Giving and Receiving are the same. You get back a match to what you feel about giving to others...it's the Law of Attraction. </p>

He made a $730 donation. Since then, Albert Lexie has added over $90,000 more – saved over the course of many years from the tips he makes polishing shoes at the hospital and at local businesses. </p>
       <p>Albert Lexie, 62, has been shining shoes at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh since 1982. Tuesday and Thursday each week, Albert leaves his home at 6 a.m. to arrive at Children’s at 7:30 a.m. to shine shoes. Through the years, he has given all of his tips – more than $97,000 – to the Free Care Fund, which ensures that all Children’s patients receive the medical care they need regardless of their families’ ability to pay. What makes this gift so inspiring is - he only earns about $10,000 a year. </p>

       <p>Living pesticide free is living poison free. And what of the bugs? There are many safe and sane alternatives. </p>
       <p>Estelle’s passion is her family and loved ones. Blessed with common sense, she knew pesticide meant poison. Those simple facts led to a huge, continuing campaign to rid the land of poison. And their results? </p>
       <p><strong>There are nearly 50 toxic, herbicide, and fungicide free parks in Santa Barbara; the Santa Barbara County schools are also toxic free.</strong> </p>

       <p>Estelle is the Executive Director of Pesticide Awareness &amp; Alternative Coalition or PAAC, an organization she helped form. <span id="green-font">Their mission is simple: There are non-toxic alternatives and killing a few bugs is not worth sickening or killing people.</span> It seems self-evident – but it’s taken years to reach this understanding in the local government agencies that control the use of pesticides. </p>
       <p>Estelle assisted Wendy Kaysing and friends from Ojai to follow PAAC methods and they are now well on the way to a pesticide free Ojai. Topanga Canyon is meeting this month to form a coalition to rid their neighborhood of toxic chemicals. </p>

       <p>Estelle got Hollywood celebrities (including Gregory Peck, Anthony Franciosa, Jack Klugman, and Rod Steiger) to record their views regarding the disaster.

       <p></p>
       <p>In 1998 a sad catastrophe befell Estelle's neighbor. Her child developed Bells Palsy. Another neighbor repeatedly sprayed Dursban (now illegal) for termites in his home—the toxic spray was blown into Estelle's neighbor’s home. The woman and her child become deathly ill. </p>
       <p>Estelle, along with a few other mothers banded together to help but neither the city, police, fire department nor legal authorities helped. No one would stop the spraying. </p>
       <p>Then a baby next door became unresponsive and the mother had serious headaches. A toxicologist determined they were chemically poisoned. Yet there was still no recourse anywhere from local, county or state officials. </p>
