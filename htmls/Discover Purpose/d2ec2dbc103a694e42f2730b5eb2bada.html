   <li><i>Purposes</i> 
    <ul> 
     <li><i>Poetry and other Arts</i> 
      <ul> 
       <li>"<span class="quote">poetry is music set to words</span>", <span class="author">Dennis O'Driscoll</span></li> 
       <li>"<span class="quote">One of [Donald Davie's favourite notions] was that there were three useful analogies for the understanding of literature in general and modern literature in particular. Poetry was like theatre, as in Yeats; like music, as in Pasternak and Eliot; and like sculpture, as in Pound</span>", <span class="author">Denis Donoghue</span>, "<span class="title">Words Alone</span>", 2000 </li> 
       <li>"<span class="quote">Poetry, unlike music, is a meta-art, and relies upon non-physical structures for the production of its effects. In its case, the medium is syntax, grammar and logical continuity, which together form the carrier-wave of plain sense within which its deeper meanings are broadcast.</span>", <span class="author">Don Paterson</span>, "<span class="title">The empty image: new models of the poetic trope</span>",</li> 
       <li>"<span class="quote">Poetry lies at the centre of the literary experience because it is the form that most clearly asserts the specificity of literature</span>", <span class="author">Jonathan Culler</span>, "<span class="title">Structuralist Poetics: Structuralism, Linguistics and the Study of Literature</span>", Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1975, p.189</li> 
       <li>"<span class="quote">Of all the arts poetry (which owes its origin almost entirely to genius and will least be guided by precept or example) maintains the first rank</span>", <span class="author">Kant</span>, "<span class="title">Critique of Judgement</span>", p.215</li> 
       <li>"<span class="quote">Hegel declares that poetry is supreme among the arts, combining music's apprehension of the inner life of the mind with the determinate phenomenal character of sculpture and painting. In contrast to many of his contemporaries who make similar claims, however, Hegel never wavers in insisting that poetry is the crisis of art as much as it is its triumph. Poetry's uniqueness stems from the fact that the subject and the object of poetry, the medium and the message, are one and the same. Unlike painting or sculpture, poetry can deal with any and every topic in any and every fashion because in the final analysis what poetry really expresses is the mind's apprehension of itself to itself in itself</span>", "<span class="title">Derrida, Hegel, and the Language of Finitude</span>", <span class="author">Jan Mieszkowski</span>, Postmodern Culture, May 2005</li> 
      </ul> </li> 
     <li><i>Poetry and Ritual</i> 
      <ul> 
       <li>"<span class="quote">Poetry speaks most effectively and inclusively (whether in free or formal verse) when it recognizes its connection - without apology - to its musical and ritualistic origins</span>", <span class="author">Dana Gioia</span>, "<span class="title">The Dark Horse</span>", 2015, p.13</li> 
       <li>"<span class="quote">I suggest that what artists do in all media can be summarized as deliberately performing the operations that occur instinctively during a ritualized behaviour: they simplify or formalize, repeat (sometimes with variation), exaggerate, and elaborate in both space and time for the purpose of attracting attention and provoking and manipulating emotional response</span>", <span class="author">Dissanayake</span>, "<span class="title">Aesthetic Incunabula"</span>, Philosophy and Literature - Volume 25, Number 2, October 2001.</li> 
       <li> "<span class="quote"><i>all</i> art emulates the condition of ritual. That is what it comes from and to that it must always return for nourishment</span>", <span class="author">T.S. Eliot</span>, <span class="title">The Dial 75</span></li> 
      </ul> </li> 
     <li><i>Poetry and Life</i> 
      <ul> 
       <li>"<span class="quote">poetry gets to be the poetry of life by successfully becoming first the poetry of poetry</span>", <span class="author">Hollander</span>, "<span class="title">Melodious Guile</span>", Yale Univ Press, 1988, p.15 </li> 
       <li> "<span class="quote">Those who are not very concerned with art want poems or pictures to record for them something they already know - as one might want a picture of a place he loves</span>" <span class="author">George Oppen</span>, "<span class="title">An Adequate Vision: A George Oppen Daybook</span>", ed Davidson, IR 26:5-31, p.29. </li> 
       <li>"<span class="quote">Poems very seldom consist of poetry and nothing else; and pleasure can be derived also from their other ingredients. I am convinced that most readers, when they think they are admiring poetry, are deceived by inability to analyse their sensations, and that they are really admiring, not the poetry of the passage before them, but something else in it, which they like better than poetry</span>", <span class="author">A.E. Housman</span>, "<span class="title">The Name and Nature of Poetry</span>" (lecture), 1933. </li> 
       <li>"<span class="quote">The public, as a whole, does not demand or appreciate the pure expression of beauty. Its cultured members expect to find in poetry, if anything, repose from material and nervous anxiety; an apt or chiselled phrase strokes the appetites and tickles the imagination. The more general public merely enjoys its platitudes and truisms jerked on to the understanding in line and rhyme; truth put into metre sounds overwhelmingly true</span>", <span class="author">Harold Monro</span>, "<span class="title">The Future of Poetry</span>", Poetry Review, January 1912</li> 
      </ul> </li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">artworks not only mime nature; they also mime the accepted modes of miming</span>", <span class="author">Stephen H. Blackwell</span>, "<span class="title">The Quill and the Scalpel</span>", Ohio State University Press, 2009, p.88</li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">art as a whole is a riddle. Another way of putting this is to say that art expresses something while at the same time hiding it</span>", <span class="author">Adorno</span>,"<span class="title"></span>" </li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">What the artist tries to do (either consciously or unconsciously) is to not only capture the essence of something but also to amplify it in order to more powerfully activate the same neural mechanisms that would be activated by the original object</span>", <span class="author">Ramachandran</span>, 1999</li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">It is a mistake to suppose, with some philosophers of aesthetics, that art and poetry aim to deal with the general and the abstract. This misconception has been foisted upon us by mediaeval logic. Art and poetry deal with the concrete of nature, not with separate 'particulars,' for such rows do not exist.</span>", <span class="author">Fenollosa</span>, <span class="title">The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry</span>, p.27</li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">The function of poetry is to point out that the sign is not identical to the referent</span>", <span class="author">Jacobson</span></li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">The end of writing is to instruct; the end of poetry is to instruct by pleasing</span>", <span class="author">Samuel Johnson</span>, "<span class="title">Johnson on Shakespeare</span>" (ed. Walter Raleigh), 1908. p.16</li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">one’s deepest impulse in writing … is to my mind not "I must tell everybody about that" (i.e. responsibility to other people) but "I must stop that from being forgotten if I can" (i.e. responsibility towards subject)</span>", <span class="author">Philip Larkin</span>, "<span class="title">Daily Telegraph interview</span>" </li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">All <i>Poetry</i>, to speak with Aristotle and the Greek critics (if for so plain a point authorities be thought wanting) is, properly, <i>imitation</i>. It is, indeed, the noblest and most extensive of the mimetic arts; having all creation for its object, and ranging the entire circuit of universal being</span>", <span class="author">Richard Hurd</span>, "<span class="title">Discourse on Poetical Imitation</span>", 1751</li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">Poetry exists partly to undermine the certainties of an accepted intellectual system, by opening a fissure of awareness at which the reality of the unconquered world may enter</span>", "<span class="title">Slip-shod Sibyls</span>", <span class="author">Germaine Greer</span>, Viking, 1995, p.3</li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">I want poetry not to be <i>like</i> reality but to be as impossible as reality</span>" - <span class="author">Keston Sutherland</span></li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">The job of the poet (a job which can't be learned) consists of placing those objects of the visible world which have become invisible due to the glue of habit, in an unusual position which strikes the soul and gives them a tragic force</span>", <span class="author">Cocteau</span>, p.12, "<span class="title">La Mort et les Statues</span>", Paris, 1977. </li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">The future of poetry is immense, because in poetry, where it is worthy of its high destinies, our race, as time goes on, will find an ever surer and surer stay ... More and more mankind will discover that we have to turn to poetry to interpret life for us, to console us, to sustain us</span>", <span class="author">Matthew Arnold</span>, "<span class="title">The Study of Poetry</span>". </li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">If reality impacted directly on our senses and our consciousness, if we could have direct communication between the material world and ourselves, art would be unnecessary</span>", <span class="author">Bergson</span>, "<span class="title" laughter></span>" </li> 
     <li> "<span class="quote">If what has happened in the one person were communicated directly to the other, all art would collapse, all the effects of art would disappear</span>", <span class="author">Valéry</span>, "<span class="title">Reflections</span>", p.64, Collected Works 13:142.</li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">The non-mimetic character of language is thus, in a certain way, the opportunity and the condition for poetry to exist. Poetry exists only to 'renumerate' in other words, to repair and compensate for the 'defect of languages'</span>" - <span class="author">Gerard Genette</span>, "<span class="title">Valéry and the Poetics of Language</span>"</li> 
     <li> "<span class="quote">The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of art is to make objects 'unfamiliar', to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception, because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged. Art is a way of experiencing the artfulness of an object; the object is not important</span>" - <span class="author">Shklovsky</span>, "<span class="title">Art as Technique</span>", 1917 (in Russian Formalist Criticism: Four Essays, Lemon and Reis, Univ of Nebraska Press, 1965), p.12</li> 
     <li> "<span class="quote">Poetry presents the thing in order to convey the feeling. It should be precise about the thing and reticent about the feeling, for as soon as the mind responds and connects with the thing the feeling shows in the words</span>" - <span class="author">Wei T'ai</span>, 11th century.</li> 
     <li> "<span class="quote">No longer do we accept the 'sublimation model' according to which 'the function of art is to sublimate or transform experience, raising it from ordinary to extraordinary, from commonplace to unique, from low to high'</span>", <span class="author">Rosalind Krauss</span>, <span class="title">October 56</span>, [spring 1991]:3</li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">A poem points to nothing but itself. Information is relative. A poem is absolute</span>", <span class="author">EM Forster</span>, "<span class="title">Anonymity: An Inquiry</span>", 1925.</li> 
     <li> "<span class="quote">Poetry is not only the most concise way of conveying the human experience; it also offers the highest possible standards for any linguistic operation</span>" - <span class="author">Brodsky</span>, "<span class="title">On Grief and Reason</span>", Hamish Hamilton, 1996</li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">The primary function of poetry, as of all the arts, is to make us more aware of ourselves and the world around us. I do not know if such increased awareness makes us more moral or more efficient. I hope not. I think it makes us more human, and I am quite certain it makes us more difficult to deceive</span>", <span class="author">Auden</span>, in "<span class="title">The English Auden: Poems, Essays and Dramatic Writings, 1927-1939</span>", ed Mendelson, Faber, p.371 </li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">The primary pigment of poetry is the IMAGE</span>", <span class="title">BLAST</span></li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">The poetic myths are dead; and the poetic image, which is the myth of the individual, reigns in their stead</span>" - <span class="author">C. Day Lewis</span></li> 
     <li>"<span class="quote">Thought must be hidden in the verse like nutritional virtue in a fruit</span>", <span class="author">Valéry</span> </li>

"<span class="quote">Modal difficulties lie with the beholder</span>", "modal difficulties challenge the inevitable parochialism of honest empathy", "Current man seeks to efface [the distinction between Contingent and Modal difficulties].

     <li><i>Tactical</i> - "<span class="quote">source in the writer's will or in the failure of adequacy between his intention and his performative means</span>", p.33. Some poets feel they must create new words and syntactic modes, for how else can they say new things? But once people understand the words, these too will be shop-worn. So instead revitalise old uses; undermine, distort. "We are not meant to understand easily and quickly". "'Contingently' and 'modally' Wallace Stevens's 'Anecdote of the Jar' is transparent" - Clear message: "however simple[], the work of art [] sets ordinance upon the surrounding chaos of the organic" but "It is the last two lines that obstruct and unsettle" "This rich undecidability is exactly what the poet aims at. It can be made a hollow trick (as it often is with the syntactic instabilities in Dylan Thomas)." Or it can make us "reach out towards more delicate orderings of perception" </li> 
     <li><i>Ontological</i> (breaks the poet/reader contract). "<span class="quote">At certain levels, we are not meant to understand <i>at all</i> ... But again we ask: for whom, then is the poet writing, let alone publishing? .. It is not so much the poet who speaks, but language itself</span>", p.45 </li>

The product of contradictory traditions, today's writers often take aspects from two or more to create poetry that is truly postmodern in that it's an unpredictable and unprecedented mix ... Today's hybrid poem might engage such conventional approaches as narrative that presumes a stable first-person, yet complicate it by disrupting the linear temporal path or by scrambling the normal syntactical sequence. Or it might foreground recognizably experimental modes such as illogicality or fragmentation, yet follow the strict formal rules of a sonnet or a villanelle. Or it might be composed entirely of neologisms but based in ancient traditions. Considering the traits associated with "conventional" work, such as coherence, linearity, formal clarity, narrative, firm closure, symbolic resonance, and stable voice, and those generally assumed of "experimental" work, such as non-linearity, juxtaposition, rupture, fragmentation, immanence, multiple perspective, open form, and resistance to closure, hybrid poets access a wealth of tools </span>", <span class="author">Cole Swensen</span>, "<span class="title">American Hybrid: A Norton Anthology of New Poetry</span>", W.

     <li>"<span class="quote">Speaking broadly, there are two general modes in UK &amp; US poetry ... one is a product focussed aesthetic, the other is a process-based approach. The product focussed aesthetic relies on clarity of context, presenting self-contained, more or less complete thoughts and evincing a concern for descriptive accurary when considering the external world. It is, to caricature slightly, occupied with realizing recalled events, sometimes through memory's distorting effects, while keeping failings of language under discursive control. This is often also called 'mainstream'. ... Its weakness is that it can rely too heavily on rhetorical commonplaces, or conceits, and can easily feel naively decorative to the more philosophically concerned, or sentimental or even redundant in its efforts to describe the outside world convincingly. The process-led approach ... is concerned with poetry as a way of speaking about the world that simultaneously presents the difficulties of doing so. ... To the young contemporary ear, being too 'product' in approach can end up sounding pompous or over-wrought; old hat. Too experimental or 'process' focused can seem solipsistic and, again, but differently, over-wrought ... So, we have a popularising neo-surrealist ironic school in evidence, growing out of a collision between the 'product' and 'process' approaches outlined; a poetry of the absurd, ironising meaning-making, which in fact one can find moving and meaningful, allegorically</span>", <span class="author">Nathan Hamilton</span>, "<span class="title"> Rialto 70</span>", 2010, p.4-5 </li>

     <li>"<span class="quote">Ashbery has consciously rejected transparency, received notions of realism in poetry, and confession, all of which were (and still are) believed to be allegorical narratives that naturally culminate in revelation, universal truth, or epiphany. All too often, these states of illuminated insight are familiar and border on cliché. The revelation is not something the poet discovers in the process of writing, but is something he or she already possesses, and must figure out how to package. Such poems are full of detachable symbols and images, triggers that set off the reader's sympathetic Pavlovian response. Ashbery is against both the predictable and the detachable, which allows a poem to be reduced to a theme or be summed up.</span>", <span class="author">John Yau</span>, <span class="title">APR</span>, May/June 2005, p.46</li>

<li>"In my first few weeks on the wards, I made a series of 
brilliant diagnoses ... recognising rare conditions from the slightest hints.
Every single one of these diagnoses was wrong - and ludicrously so. And they
were wrong precisely because they were brilliant. I learnt several things
from this: that 'common things occur commonly', so that a sense of
probability is more important than an ability to summon recherche
information from the recesses of one's mind... Most important of all, 
I learnt that interpretations that fit together brilliantly - and so 
reflect the brilliance of one's own mind - are almost certainly going to be
