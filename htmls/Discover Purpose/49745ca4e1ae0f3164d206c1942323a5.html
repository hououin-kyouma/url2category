          <p>Preface by Gregg Prescott, M.S.<br> <em>Editor, <a href="http://www.in5d.com/" target="_new">In5D.com</a></em></p> 
          <p>When an animal appears to you in a dream or out in nature, what is the symbolism of this particular creature? Nothing happens by coincidence and these animals are here to teach us lessons. Find out below the answers to animal symbolism!</p> 
          <p>Quick story: I was watching some metaphysical videos on YouTube when I heard a rustling sound in my bedroom. I didn’t think twice about it until about an hour later, when I was about to leave my house to pick up my daughter and noticed a woodchuck IN MY 2nd STORY BEDROOM! I shut the door, picked up my daughter and we returned to film this event. Don’t miss the surprise ending!!!</p>

          <p>I found this animal to be very interesting in terms of metaphysical symbolism:</p> 
          <blockquote>
           <p><em>Because the woodchuck hibernates during the winter, the animal is symbolic of understanding the cycles of life, death, and rebirth. </em></p>
          </blockquote> 
          <p>It seems that we are going through a rebirth of consciousness so this event was most appropriate!</p> 
          <p>Anyway, enjoy the following analysis of animal symbolism and refer to this chart when an animal mysteriously comes into your life because <em>there is no such thing as coincidence!</em></p>

          <h3>Ant</h3> 
          <p>The ant is a very hard worker and conscientious in every detail of its work. They live in huge communities where most tasks are delegated to individuals who form work groups to carry out various activities of hunting, gathering, nesting and nursery, habitat construction, and protection. The ant accepts its position within its community without question and is totally dedicated and loyal throughout its lifetime to the entire community.The ant people are wonderful builders and architects. They can show us ways to build a reality based on our dreams.</p> 
          <p>Ants are determined and relentless in pursuit of their mission. If the ant people come to visit you, it may be this quality they will teach.</p> 
          <p>Solidarity and collaboration are keys to the success of the ant. Every individual in the community does its duty to ensure the welfare of the whole colony, regardless of its personal safety or how long it must labor. The ant spirit teaches us teamwork and loyalty.</p> 
          <p>Ants are unselfish and sacrifice themselves to benefit the community. Learning this valuable lesson of the ant can be the greatest of all gifts.</p>

          <p>Honor and respect are the hallmarks of the ant people.</p> 
          <p>Ants are tireless workers and hunters and teach the art of perseverance and patience in all that they do. Those with this spirit will find that many of their life lessons will involve the mastery of patience in some way.</p> 
          <p>Ant medicine is subtle yet powerful. It teaches us how to release our egos and aligns us with the virtue of equality. Imagine what the world would be like if humanity held and applied the values that the ant expresses. The next time you step on, squash, injure or kill an ant intentionally, ask yourself why you are choosing to destroy the unconditional love that the ant shares so freely. Valuable insights about yourself and your history can be learned from this tiny little totem.</p> 
          <p><strong>Dream Analysis</strong>: If ant appears in your dreams, or you have other unusual ant encounters, you should ask yourself, if you are relying on others to help you complete your project. We can’t do it all alone. We need others to support our efforts. Reach out and ask others to do their part.</p>

          <h3>Armadillo</h3>

Teaches how to use defenses when needed. Is it time to hide away to collect thoughts or come out and present your thoughts and abilities? Are you letting your guard down too often? Armadillo can show you how to protect your personal space.Brother armadillo has a passive style of defense and its medicine comes from its own body. The ‘digger’ is called the “Little Armored One” because of thick bony plates and horns that covers its back. It teaches protection and ways to move through dimensions.</p> 
          <p>The armadillo rolls into a tight ball when threatened to cover its vulnerable underside.

When threatened, the skunk raises its bushy tail, stamps its feet, stiffens its legs and the hair on body raises up and it hisses like a angry cat. It these tactics do not work to frighten the invader, the skunk simply turns its rump and sprays up to 10 – 14 feet with accuracy. This disgusting musk liquid irritates the eyes, temporarily blocks vision and stuns other senses of its victim such as smell and touch.

          <h3>Turkey</h3> 
          <p>Wild turkeys lived almost ten million years ago and are native to North America. Between 5,000 and 6,000 feathers cover the body of an adult turkey. Related to pheasants, gobbling of turkeys can be heard a mile away. Wild turkeys have excellent vision during the day but don’t see as well at night. Turkeys can run at speeds up to 25 mph, and can fly up to 55 mph. Wild turkeys like open areas for feeding, mating and habitat. They use forested areas as cover from predators and for roosting in trees at night. A varied habitat of both open and covered area is essential for wild turkey survival.A wild turkey is a clean bird in many respects and considers its appearance important. A turkey’s colorful metallic iridescence glittering feathers provide a variety of survival functions – they keep him warm and dry, allow him to fly, feel and show off for the opposite sex. Turkey feathers were used American Indians to stabilize arrows and adorn ceremonial dress, and the spurs on the legs of wild tom turkeys were used as projectiles on arrowheads. If the spirit of the turkey struts into your life it may be to remind you that hygiene and appearances are important to self-respect and respect for others.</p> 
          <p>Turkeys have very good hearing and can see in color and tiny movement almost a hundred yards away. The message of the turkey spirit could be to closely examine our actions and how they relate to our spiritual path.</p> 
          <p>Toms and sometimes hens have black, hair-like feathers called beards on their chest. Turkeys’ heads change colors when they become excited as both defense and warning to other turkeys. If your spirit turkey shows you these characteristics, it is time to sit up and take notice of your own actions that may hinder your spiritual growth. You may also need to look at people, situations or events around you.</p> 
          <p>Wild turkeys eat whatever is available in the immediate terrain including nuts, berries, green foliage, insects, and lizards. This habit has been seen in vision given by a spirit turkey and was interpreted to mean to make good use of the talents and resources, to waste nothing and give thanks daily for the bounty and blessings given by the Creator.</p> 
          <p>Turkeys fly powerfully for short distances but have difficulty in sustaining great speed over a long distance. If you see turkey flying into your life in this way, its message may be to start redirecting your spiritual energy in a more balanced or efficient way. Quick bursts of enthusiasm or energy can lead to undesirable results.</p> 
          <p>The wild turkey is a resilient bird and survivor. After heavy, uncontrolled hunting by European settlers and American hunters, the turkey almost vanished to near extinction by the early 1900’s. But, through conservation turkey populations have rebounded and are growing. Wild turkeys almost vanished from North America largely due to greed and disrespect. To American Indians the wild turkey symbolizes renewal and rebirth that must take place for all nature in order for humans to survive. The turkey also symbolizes the spirit of freedom that must be respected by all people.</p> 
          <h3>Turtle</h3> 
          <p>You can help but admire turtle and tortoises. Their ancient wisdom, unfaltering character and physical characteristics make them among nature’s most interesting creatures. The turtle is a creature of both water and the land. Because of its great age and its slow metabolism the turtle is associated with longevity. The oldest known tortoise died in 1965 in Madagascar at the age of 188. The largest living species is the Galapagos tortoise weighing in some cases, over 570 pounds. Stupendemys geographicus was a prehistoric turtle that was 10 feet long and probably weighed 4,000 to 5,000 pounds. Turtle medicine can teach new perceptions about time and our relationship to it. It can also help us grow old gracefully and in harmony with our environment. When the pace of life becomes too hectic the turtle shows us how to slow down and go with the flow.The turtle has its own built-in house on their back. The upper shell is composed of about 50 bones, including modified ribs, vertebrae and bony skin plates. The shell is very much alive and not dead tissue. If turtle has crawled into your subconscious, it may carry the message to remain mobile and flexible in your spiritual walk and not to acquire more possessions that you need. The burden of possessions can slow our spiritual journey.</p> 
          <p>Growth rings (scutes or scales) on a turtle/ tortoise shell cannot be used to determine its age with any degree of accuracy. In most cases, the rings are determined largely by environmental conditions. The size, color and other physical adaptations of the turtle are also largely determined by its environment. The turtle teaches us to accept the world we live in and to adapt to changes when needed.</p> 
          <p>Grandfather Turtle has amazing survival skills and strategies. They sense vibrations in the water through their skin and shell. If turtle comes with a message for you, it may be interpreted to mean that you should listen closely to your physical and spiritual senses and vibrations and move slowly and cautiously to adapt.</p> 
          <p>Water turtles come ashore to lay eggs and bury them in the ground. After the eggs hatch, the baby turtles crawl to the water. This characteristic is a significant sign in pointing out connections, especially for the purpose of reproduction, between the elements of water and earth. Turtle may be telling us to combine the deep emotional and spiritual qualities of the water element with the strong and solid grounding qualities of Mother Earth in our search for balance.</p> 
          <p>When the turtle negotiates uneven terrain and its weight causes it to flip over on to its rounded shell, it uses its strong neck to right itself. This ability when communicated by messages from the turtle may be a sign to use the tools at your disposal to use your inner senses and knowledge to correct the problem when your life becomes upside down.</p> 
          <p>When old turtle slowly crawls in to your dreams and visions, it is time to get connected to your most ancient heart and delve deeply in to the shell you have constructed around yourself. Peer deeply into that shell. The turtle cannot be separated from its shell and we cannot separate ourselves from who we are. We can develop ways to emerge from our shell to interact and take sustenance from the world around us, and at the same time, allow that emergence to be a blessing to all around you and your spiritual walk on earth.</p> 
          <p>The slow moving plod of the turtle does sooner or later get them to where they are going. The turtle is famous for getting things done in its own slow-moving way and winning the race. Could this be a sign for you to slow down and enjoy the blessings gifted by the Creator?</p>

          <p>People who know weasel medicine have exceptional opportunity to learn powers of close observation. Searching out the meaning and cause of events, situations or problems is a positive trait of the weasel. Seeing beneath the surface of things enables the weasel spirit to contemplate deeper meanings.

          <p>As a fearless warrior, a weasel grabs the throat of its victim and quickly severs its arteries with sharp teeth and strong jaws – teaching those who seek the weasel to be less aggressive in relationships and show mercy in word and deed.</p> 
          <p>It is said the weasel is a loner who has no code of honor as they often kill more than they can eat and sometimes steal the food of others. This medicine teaches us not to be wasteful and careless of others feelings and to respect the rights and property of our neighbors.</p> 
          <p><strong>Dream Analysis</strong>: Something may not be what it appears. Observe your surroundings. Pay attention to what is going on inside and around you.</p> 
          <p><strong>Wolf</strong></p> 
          <p>Royalty, spirit, strength, friendly, family, sociable, intelligent, ritualistic in nature (applies to all of life), balances flexibility to establish harmony and order in life, new paths and journeys, freedom to move within the realms of insights and attachments. Teaches able to be steadfast, familial protection, Epitome of the wild spirit. Wolf guides the use of resources and the lesson of adaptability along with teaching and instruction. Wolf helps to tap into inner strength and intuition. Sometimes transformation accompanies Wolf’s lessons. Are you using your resources wisely for the greater good? Are you nourishing your family and those around you? Are you listening to your instincts to avoid confrontations? Wolf will add in balancing harmony and wisdom to take control of your life.The wolf has been much misunderstood and maligned in history and is not the vicious intruder of western fairy tales. The wolf is a shy, yet very sociable creature with strong rules of behavior. Fear of the wolf is perhaps born when its eerie howl raises the hackles on our neck and in our souls. Maybe we do not fear the wolf at all, but only the wild nature within ourselves. To American Indians, the wolf is said to be “teacher” medicine. We study wolfs ways of hunting and their social structure. The wolf is associated with the Dog Star, Sirus and some cultures belief humans came from this distant star. Wolf populations are threatened in the lower 48 states, but abundant in Alaska and Canada. Wolf has much to teach us, if only we will listen.</p> 
          <p>Wolves live in a communal structure like humans. The Alpha male and female lead a strict social order. Next in the order are Beta wolves who do not breed and serve as nursemaids for pups of the pack. The Omega wolf is at the bottom rung and is the ‘scapegoat’ in situations when the pack is being attacked. Often the Omega wolf is forced not to eat when food is scarce. If wolf has entered the forest of your mind, it may be to teach you that all things in nature have order amid chaos and to accept your duties in life, whether they be leadership roles or otherwise, with humility and strength.</p> 
          <p>The wolf spirit teaches us to have balance between your personal needs and those of the family and community. Wolves are absolutely committed and loyal to the pack and find their place within the group. If wolf exhibits these traits, it may mean that you must examine your function within the community and loyalty. It may also be a sign to bring better balance to the varied interests of self, family and community.</p> 
          <p>The hunting techniques of wolves served as an example for many tribes who copied them. Members of the pack form ‘tag teams’ who take turns chasing prey to exhaust the prey before themselves. Packs are known to have run over thirty miles a day in pursuit. Cooperation in achieving a common goal is the message conveyed here.</p> 
          <p>Wolves have developed many ways to communicate by body language and vocally. Facial expressions, tail and ear movements, body posture, teeth bearing, eye squinting and scratching are part of their vocabulary. Vocally, a wide variety of growls, yelps, whines and howls make up a sophisticated system of communication. Wolf language helps the pack to identify and locate its members, establish territorial boundaries, give instruction, request assistance, sound warnings, teach the young, and generally to bring cohesion and unity to the pack. If a wolf or wolves have entered your physic, you are fortunate to have an animal spirit to knows the importance of communication and one that will find many ways to make their messages know to you. This ability to communicate may be a sign to hone your own speaking skills to effectively relate your feelings and ideas in a good way – to pray, sing and dance in praise of the blessings of the Creator.</p> 
          <p>When a lone wolf is seen the wild it symbolizes freedom. When seen in a pack it represents community. If wolf appears to you alone or in a pack it is asking you to acquire the same within your own life.</p> 
          <p>The primal and piercing howl of the wolf sometimes is marking their territory boundaries. If you hear a wolf howl it might be telling you to stand your ground and defend your boundaries.</p> 
          <p>Wolves have great stamina and strength. They do not fight needlessly and often avoid fighting whenever possible. Wolf teaches to know who you are and to develop strength and confidence.</p> 
          <p>Wolf is associated with the lunar influences and energies that rule psychic perception. They teach us to respect our emotions and face the darkness within.</p> 
          <p>The wolf is ritualistic. It knows the importance of regular lunar howling ceremonies and daily social rituals designed to communicate needs and express feelings. The message of your wolf spirit may be to honor the forces of spirituality and connect with the life forces of Mother Earth.</p> 
          <p><strong>Dream Analysis</strong>: Wolf’s message is to ask yourself if you are being a loyal friend, are your friends’ being loyal to you, or are you being loyal to yourself? Wolf can also be asking you if you have made a plan to achieve your goals?</p>

          <p>The coloring of wolverines allows them to be unseen in the shadows and out in the open as well. They can wrench and wring their bodies into various shapes that allow them to wriggle into small cervices.
