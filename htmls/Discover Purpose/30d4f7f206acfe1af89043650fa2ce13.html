DOROTHY BARR  ADDRESS: CORNUBIA, AUSTRALIA PHONE: +61 (0) 438253060 E-mail: dbworkshops@yahoo.com.au  Level: 1 DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK?: Yes  DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE?: Yes, &amp; Skype DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: “Why have you chosen to be here, on this planet, at this time” It is not by accident!! Evolutionary Astrology can provide you with a valuable key to understanding your Souls story and to discover what you have chosen to experience in this lifetime. It offers an amazing opportunity to heal the timeline and move forward in your evolutionary journey. Your Natal Chart is the most powerful tool to self-understanding, self-empowerment, and how to live your life authentically, thereby bringing a greater sense of peace, harmony and purpose to your life.I have been studying Astrology for over 30years, beginning with a correspondence course in Cosmobiology with Doris Greaves whilst living in PNG. After moving to South Africa, I gained an Advanced Diploma in Astrospychology with Maureen Demot.&nbsp;Returning to live in Australia, I wanted to begin sharing Astrology in an experiential way which would allow Therapists and Practitioners of other modalities to provide a valuable key for them to understand more about their clients, their challenges and potentials. I created and began teaching my own course, and have been teaching and sharing this for 20 years.&nbsp;When I discovered Steven Forrest’s Evolutionary Astrology, I felt as though I had “come home”, it resonated so deeply with me, and excited my passion for Astrology to an even greater height. I am also a Louise Hay “Heal Your Life” Facilitator, and Aura-Soma Teacher to Advanced Level.&nbsp; I have combined the 2 ancient wisdom systems of Astrology and Colour into a “Soul Paths” workshop which offers an experience of the Soul Journey through a visible and glorious reflection in colour.
KAREN BART ADDRESS: Brooklyn, NY&nbsp; PHONE:&nbsp;347-349-2661 EMAIL:&nbsp;Blueststar21@gmail.com WEBSITE: Findyourvoiceastrology.com LEVEL: Master  DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK? Yes&nbsp; DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes&nbsp; DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: Thirty years ago I made my way to Mason’s Bookshop, a metaphysical book store on Lexington Avenue in New York near Bloomingdales. I was interested in metaphysics and looking forward to my first astrological reading. I knew that we’re all born with a purpose and life challenges and sensed there was other work I was meant to do.
Zoltan Mason strongly encouraged me to study astrology as he pointed to relevant planets and signs in my chart, saying I’d do well with both “a vocation and an avocation”. It was all quite interesting. I bought two books and left with good insights, but was less than satisfied with the approach of how he described the gloomy influence of the planet Saturn in terms of what it could do for me and others. Still, he pointed to other places in my chart where I could overcome and balance such influences. At the time I was a Pan American “Stewardess”. Adventure and freedom ranked high on my list, and just slightly below my quest to find love along with a strong desire to help people. I used my opportunities to travel to bring toys and clothing to orphanages abroad. As years passed, I did find love, had a family of my own, worked in the business world and flew for another airline. Somewhere in there I pulled out those two books and read them and my interest was rekindled; however, it was only after I met and studied with Steven Forrest and learned the Evolutionary approach, that my love for this art was truly awakened.
I got that nothing in your birthchart is “bad”. Understanding this empowered me to develop a deeper awareness of SELF, be more compassionate, and get clear as to my path, which has led me to better decisions. Evolutionary astrology can unravel mysteries from the past that can then be turned around into something that works for you. It’s about identifying your areas of challenge and strength, and seeing how you self-express into the world. At every moment we have the ability to shift and transcend our focus to create a happier, more satisfying life. As it has empowered me to find my own voice, it would be my pleasure to see you claim yours.
ELLEN BARTIN  ADDRESS: 34 Rockwood Forest Ridge, Wildwood, MO 63025 PHONE: 636-938-6343 E-mail: EllenBartin@sbcglobal.net Level: 2 DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK?: Yes DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE?: Yes (I make a tape and send it following the reading.) DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS?: Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: My astrological “scientific observation” began at age sixteen. But it reached maturity in 1998 when I began formal studies with my mentors Steven Forrest and Demetra George and started consulting with clients. I’m a Massage Therapist and an Evolutionary Astrology. I’ve found that both disciplines allow me to follow the cycles and evolving patterns unfolding within us and around us. Astrology charts our personal journey and cues us to the optimum times for expanding self-awareness. One of my favorite things about astrology is that it is an ancient symbolic language rooted in mankind’s mythological past. By applying technique, mythic stories and intuition, I hope to shed a little more light upon “all this joy and pain,” as Goethe says. Astrology links the mundane and the cosmic and shows us the “middle ground” so that we may respond to life with greater insight, less fear and a deeper understand of our unique purpose.
PATRICIA BECHDOLT, Th.D.ADDRESS: Los Angeles, CAPHONE: 323-829-8086EMAIL: PatriciaBechdolt@aol.comWEBSITE: www.IntegrativeAstrology.com LEVEL: Master DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK? NODO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? YES DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? YES, on CDBRIEF STATEMENT: Your natal astrological chart reflects the unique pattern of the planets in the sky at the moment of your birth. It provides a set of living, dynamic directions for understanding and activating your life’s purpose in a way that feels authentic, productive, and invigorating. Your chart also lends insight into past and current circumstances, which can help you to harmonize your choices in the present moment with that larger view of your soul’s intention for your life, and to create a future aligned with your deepest sense of meaning. Patricia teaches Evolutionary Astrology at Holos University, where she earned a doctorate in Theology and Spiritual Healing with an extended emphasis in Energy Medicine and Medical Intuition. Her doctoral studies included intensives with the widely respected medical intuitive, spiritual teacher, and author Caroline Myss, Ph.D., and energy medicine pioneer and American Holistic Medical Association Founder C. Norman Shealy, M.D., Ph.D. She has also completed nearly 200 hours of in-person study with Steven Forrest. Patricia has a Los Angeles-based astrology practice with clients worldwide.
 LORI BELL  ADDRESS: &nbsp;Miami Beach, Florida&nbsp; PHONE:&nbsp;305-674-1188 E-mail:&nbsp;bellalori@gmail.com WEB SITE:&nbsp;www.loribellacupuncture.com Level: 1 DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK?: Yes&nbsp; DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes. I also offer readings via Skype. DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Phone and in-person sessions are taped. BRIEF STATEMENT:&nbsp;I discovered astrology when I was 13; living at boarding school, fascinated by my roommate’s astrology book which became mine. A world opened for me that has become a lifelong study.&nbsp; A seeker since I was very young, I was drawn to the ideas and perspective of astrology. I always felt there was so much more going on than what is immediately visible, and I wanted to know more. Astrology was that beginning for me. It became a life long process, at this point a 40+ year study, which continues to inform what I do as a health practitioner, and my own life. I’ve experienced the compatibility between astrology and my practice as acupuncturist with clients dealing with health, life challenges, and life in general.
Working with Evolutionary Astrology has been an empowering experience.&nbsp;I see we are all created with a purpose and life challenges. Understanding my own chart allowed me to develop a deeper more compassionate relationship with myself. At every moment I feel I have abilities and tools to create a joyful, successful journey, as well as opportunities for transformation and change.&nbsp; It has helped me navigate some challenging periods, and negotiate relationships with more peace, grace and love. Knowing your natal chart provides insight into the complexities and patterns at work in one’s life–and what a particular time suggests.&nbsp;Along with this insight one sees the innate strengths they are endowed with to meet the challenges of their life, as well as areas where inertia is more likely.&nbsp;This experience often becomes a catalyst towards greater self-acceptance, actualizing potential, and action.&nbsp;My interest is healing, understanding and communicating the integrity in someone’s chart.&nbsp;&nbsp;
VIRGINIA BELL ADDRESS: 245 East 21st Street, New York, NY 10010 PHONE: (212) 674-2732 EMAIL: virginiabell245@yahoo.com WEBSITE: www.virginiabellastrology.com LEVEL: Master DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK? Yes DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes (I provide a tape of the phone session) DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: I am a full time astrologer and writer living in New York City. I write the astrology column for City magazine and I am also the co-author of The Manhattan Health Pages. I have been deeply involved in the study and practice of metaphysics for over 25 years. It was in the late Eighties, during my Pluto transit, that I discovered Steven’s first book, had a reading with him and my real love of astrology was born. I have been working with clients professionally since 1994. My readings are soul-centered, responsible and compassionate, done within the framework of Evolutionary Astrology. I use myth, story telling, and humor to bring the symbols in the chart alive and to help you understand your soul’s purpose.
MARK BETTINSON ADDRESS: 1 Carey Ave. Burlington, MA 01803 PHONE: (617) 308-4289 EMAIL: markbettinson@aol.com  LEVEL: Master DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK? Yes DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes (telephone or Skype) DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: Mark Bettinson is a nine year student of Steven Forrest’s evolutionary and compassionate thinking and a thirty year student and teacher of Astrology in general. He has discovered two unique and reliable perspectives on the birth chart that reveal key developmental sequences in our lifetime. The Life Point can be seen to begin on the Mid-Heaven/Nadir Axis and progress on an 84 year cycle of contact with the natal karma. The Soul Point represents an integration of the Lunar Phase of Birth with the Zodiac. The progression of this point on a 29.5 year cycle also reveals a reliable indicator of the archetypes that you are either manifesting or responding to at particular times in your life.
Having lived in the “real” world of business, marriage, divorce, child-rearing, college education and home ownership, I am now approaching the sixth decade of my life. I am blessed and comforted in the understanding and context that Astrological symbolism has offered me. I have found no better “Window on my own Divinity” than my Birth Chart. Naturally, the symbolism means nothing without the good and supportive friends and community that fill out my life. You are part of that divinity also. As I move into my years of “maturity”, I eagerly commit to share my perspectives with those who wish to explore this magical world with me.

She is a certified Evolutionary Astrologer and approaches each session with humility, excitement, wonder and compassion for the human soul’s passage through life and beyond.

I was mesmerized by the astrological journey Steven took me on, and to this day honor him as such a beloved teacher. Over the years I have spent time with him in the apprenticeship program and on occasion when our paths have crossed in Missouri, California, Florida, and Colorado. He has showed me how to deliver astrology to my clients with integrity and deep compassion. I love astrology and the opportunity to teach others how to see their potential and go for the gold.

No WORK BY TELEPHONE? For astrological counseling sessions WORK BY TAPE? Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: Twenty-two years ago when I was beginning my counseling practice, I had a vivid visualization of receiving a box of custom-made rings that I was to distribute to others. Six years later when I had my birth chart read, I realized that astrology was the perfect match for the symbol: offering others a one-of-a-kind ring of their very own. As an evolutionary astrologer I bring both spiritual and psychological perspective to the work, seeking to engender trust in each person’s innate gifts and soulful challenges.

Kerry has served as faculty at Animas Valley Institute and the California Institute of Integral Studies where she and Brian Swimme co-teach Nature and Eros – an exploration into what it is to live in participatory engagement within a living universe and in more authentic alignment with the cultural and ecological shift of our time.

RUBY BURKHALTER ADDRESS: Carbondale, CO (near Aspen, CO) PHONE: 720-362-3305 EMAIL: astroclasses@yahoo.com WEBSITE: http://astrology-classes.com &amp; http://astrologer.net LEVEL: 1  DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK?: Yes DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE?: Yes DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS?: Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: Helping my clients find their passion in life and helping them find their way through life’s rough spots brings me my greatest joy! Astrology has helped me through so many times of change and upset that I want to share my knowledge with you. I am a life-long student of astrology and metaphysics having become interested in astrology at the age of 12. Shortly after my first Saturn return I completed a two-year course in metaphysics and earned my Respondere’ degrree at the School of Metaphysics.
At my second Saturn return I decided to make astrology my life’s work and completed a four-year, intense course of study at the International Academy of Astrology in January 2008. I discovered Steven Forrest at the Denver UAC conference and knew that his training was the only missing link to my astrological knowledge. Evolutionary astrology brings all of the pieces of your birth chart together in an amazing way! I can give you a road map of your strengths and weaknesses and coach you on how to maximize your strengths and minimize your weaknesses to transform your life. No matter what you may be going through there is always a positive, effective way to turn matters around for the good of all. I would be honored to help you in your life journey through the power of astrology. To schedule an evolutionary astrology reading contact me at evolutionary astrology reading. I am also accepting a limited number of students for astrology classes. To sign up for an astrology class contact me at astrology classes.
CATIE CADGE, Cara Evolutionary Astrology ADDRESS: 18755 Hwy 9, Boulder Creek, CA PHONE:&nbsp;(831)331-6332 EMAIL:&nbsp;&nbsp;catie@caraevolutionaryastrology.com WEBSITE:&nbsp;http://www.caraevolutionaryastrology.com/ LEVEL: Master  DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK? Yes DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: I approach each astrological reading I do as a dialogue of learning and understanding with another – a gift that I hope will honor what I believe is a sacred profession. Cara is the Celtic word for “friend,” a name I believe reflects the spirit of engagement I encourage with my clients, offering astrological insight in support of individual freedom and choice. I am an evolutionary astrologer working in Santa Cruz County. I began my journey with astrology thirty years ago, teaching myself how to read charts and how to follow changing patterns in the sky as a young woman in my twenties. As the years passed, I learned and I absorbed, reading the classic studies in astrology and continuing to teach myself. Meanwhile, in the 1990s, I became a full-time college professor of art history, a field in which I earned a Ph.D. in my early thirties. My daily work as an art historian revolved around visual symbols, patterns and compositions – not unlike analyzing the visual workings of a birthchart – a type of symbolic mandala of the soul. Having a lifelong goal to write, teach and counsel in the professional realm of astrology, I continued my passion for study, eventually deciding to pursue more formal training as an evolutionary astrologer through the Steven Forrest Apprenticeship Program in 2014. It is a great honor to have Steven Forrest as a mentor and teacher. I immersed myself in the program, taking over a dozen workshops&nbsp;in two years, successfully completing a master certificate in 2016. In addition to ongoing work and study with Steven in the Apprenticeship Program, I regularly attend professional conferences and workshops in astrology, write astrological essays and strive to be an active participant in the growing, global astrological community. Please visit my website for more information,&nbsp;www.caraevolutionaryastrology.com&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to making a connection with you!

I believe when someone books in with me they are wanting to make something knowable to ignite change in their life. Astrology is the science of Human nature giving us symbols as sign post to understand ourselves from within – meaning how do we tick. This makes it an amazing tool for discovering our hearts connection to ‘What has gone – to what is now – to where we want to travel too. When I began on this path I felt I was given a KEY to open doors and now it’s 26 yrs later and I’m still inspired and in awe of this profound knowledge system that has taken me on the most insightful heart beat of my life and I wouldn’t swap it for anything in the World. The multi dimensions of our life is like reading the pages of your own personal book giving us choice via the understanding one gains by having our charts interrupted by a qualified guide.

First, we discover our personality. What are my strengths and weaknesses? Where must I build, and where must I release? What is my fundamental approach toward life, and how does it feel to me? Second, we journey into the invisible realm of our karma. What have I mastered in previous lives, and what are my pitfalls? How can I gain a sense of strength to conquer unchartered territory? And thirdly–and most uniquely—we learn how to dedicate our lives to Earth. In the final chapter of the interpretation we dive into our most fundamental drive toward life. We humans are a unique mixture of Earth and Universe, meant to hold the two together. We ask: What does Earth wish me to do with my life? How can I create a more harmonious marriage between Earth and Universe through my actions? Where in my chart does Earth teach me how to use her strength to grasp the hidden corners of universal truth? Readings last roughly two hours and cost $125.

I am also happy to email written readings. BRIEF STATEMENT: We are not in this World by chance! We are here by choice! For each of us has very specific lessons to learn that are different from another’s! We attract into our lives the people and situations we most need to learn from. How well we learn depends on our attitude – and the choices we make. Our birthchart is the blueprint of our uniqueness which sets us apart from every other individual on the planet. It contains clues to our gifts…and our challenges. Understanding ourselves through this blueprint is a wonderful (and ongoing) tool for growth. Evolutionary Astrology can help us lead a more empowered life and a more conscious journey. It can help us identify the patterns we are trying to work through; navigate the rocky shores and ocean swells that face us every day; heal and; realize our potential. It is one powerful tool. I believe in utopian altruism and my quest is to help others towards this ideal through the realization of their individual potential and innate spiritual nature. We need more awareness and light on the planet if we are to help raise the vibration of the Earth and create a healthier future.

BRIEF STATEMENT: Sara is a member of the Association of Professional Astrologers and holds the Federation of Australian Astrologers Diploma in Astrology. She holds certificates in Palmistry and Numerology and is a professional Member of the Tarot Guild of Australia. She teaches all these disciplines as well as conducting consultations and finds the synergy obtained from integrating these sources of wisdom can be awe inspiring. Sara believes that astrology presents you with a wonderful blueprint of the energy patterns that were created at your birth, to map out your soul’s potential in this incarnation. It provides the ability to understand how the current positions and passages of the stars in the sky can be used to optimise your journey through life. Evolutionary Astrology provides added insight into feelings and patterns of behaviour that have been carried forward from unfinished business in past lifetimes and looks at the areas of life where this can be brought to consciousness and healed this time around. Sara is strongly drawn to myth and goddess energy, she is currently researching the impact of a series of the more magical and oracular asteroids in the charts of individuals drawn to the healing and oracular arts. She finds this can brings valuable connections for those seeking to find their way forward through their life issues.

YesDO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? YesBRIEF STATEMENT:&nbsp;One thing that has always stuck with me is that when I look at the Milky Way in the night sky, I intuitively know I am part of something bigger and grander then myself. Why am I here? How is it all connected? Can I get it all right in one lifetime? My journey into astrology to answer these questions has led me to explore many systems of astrology; the omen-based divinations of the Babylonians, and the Western astrological techniques from the Greeks to Sydney Omarr's little astrological cookbooks that I would religiously buy every January. Through it all, evolutionary astrology has come out the winner in answering all those questions I had. We 'come with directions', and if you take the time to read them, you find yourself more confident in making choices. You begin to understand yourself, to accept yourself...to know yourself. Let me help you find your peace.

Yes DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: Your natal chart provides an excellent tool by which to navigate your life’s journey, as astrology can open the door to greater insight, transform your outlook, and empower your future! My chart readings are designed to guide you along in your journey as you examine your life purpose, your soul’s desire, your hidden strengths and talents, your inherent challenges, and your past life karma. Learn how to navigate crossroads and crises in consciousness, and give yourself the gift of astrology by using your own chart as the best imaginable guide by which to live your life to its highest and happiest potential. A Forrest-trained astrologer, and student of archetypal, psychological, and evolutionary astrology, I have studied with Steven Forrest through his Apprenticeship Program, and at the Faculty of Astrology in the U.K., the Centre for Psychological Astrology in London, and the Astrological Society of Princeton. I have had the pleasure of studying with many of the best known names in astrology, including Liz Greene, Melanie Reinhart, Demetra George, Bernadette Brady, Rob Hand, Ken Negus, Brian Clark, Joyce Hoen, Micheal Lutin, Lynn Bell, and more. Astrology is my passion, and through it I have discovered that life is a matter of choice. My mission is to inspire, transform, and empower through astrological insight! I offer natal, transits and progressions, relationship, and career focused readings. Please visit my website at www.KarmicEvolution.com (where you may sign up for my monthly newsletter!), or my blog. I have also completed Roger Woolger’s Module I of Deep Memory Process (DMP) past life regression training, taught by astrologer Patricia Walsh, and continue my studies with an emphasis on past llfe karma, with Steven Forrest.

I am a counselor, doing my best work over time by using the chart as a guide to in-depth exploration of the inner landscape. My style is warm, humorous and earthy, and my emphasis is on your experience and perceptions rather than a rigid “definition” of your astrological patterns. I am particularly dedicated to supporting people in “taboo” areas, working with emotionally frightening and/or “socially unacceptable” material. It can be difficult to find compassionate yet honest ways of working with these subjects, relatively free of the Western social judgments about them. I believe that wholeness is the most core human desire, and nothing in the chart is inherently “good” or “bad.” It is an image of our own wholeness, and this image can be particularly valuable to those struggling with “marginalized” aspects of themselves. I am thrilled to be in the initial class of Kepler College, a groundbreaking college of astrological history, technique and synthesis. My Kepler classes have deepened and developed my understanding of astrology’s underlying principles and lost methods, which I continue to weave into my psychological and evolutionary approach.

AMY HERRING  ADDRESS: Seattle, WA EMAIL: amy@heavenlytruth.comWEBSITE: http://www.heavenlytruth.com  LEVEL: Master DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK? Yes DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: I aim at making my readings feel like a talk with an insightful friend — someone who is compassionate and helpful, but who will also be honest with you. An astrology reading should strive to go much deeper into the birth chart and ask the ‘whys’ about your behavior patterns, the ‘what’s about your spirit’s life plans and goals, and the ‘hows’ in order to help you create the life you want. This is the philosophy that guides my readings, to not only strive to support you in making changes you want to bring about in your life but also to find the valuable things in you that are hidden and uncover them.
I use astrology toward the purpose of creating self-awareness in people, to enable them to see and honor themselves, and to have the courage to be honest with themselves to allow healing and change to take place where it’s needed. No one can tell you definitively who you are. Ultimately, the inner workings of any individual are mysterious and deserve to be examined and experienced with respect and reverence. It is sometimes by studying a reflection or interpretation of you that can lead you to deeper insight. That is all I ever hope for in every reading I offer.

Yes  DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes and on Skype DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes  BRIEF STATEMENT: I am a Professional Astrologer, a PSYCH-K Facilitator, Reiki Practitioner and Intuitive Counselor. Astrology is an intrinsic part of my personal journey in conscious awakening. Its introduction provided the energetic shift onto the spiritual path I needed through satisfying a lifelong desire to know myself and understand human nature. That led to my initiation into spiritual wisdom by my first astrological mentor and then a subsequent mystery school. Having exposure to both frameworks at the same time provided the understanding that the astrological chart is a personal road map and enhancement to any spiritual practice, or modality for living your personal best and seeking spiritual awakening. Through Steven’s Evolutionary Astrology mentorship I’ve grown in my ability to communicate the chart’s symbolism and incorporate the intersection of spirituality and mythology as part of that. For the client my goal is to provide insight and perspective. Understanding how energy works and beliefs create our reality through the other modalities I work in brings a multi level enhancement to the astrological consultation. I offer a full selection of astrological services including packaged services. The deep insight astrology offers married with the rewiring of beliefs supported by PSYCH-K offers a potent energetic shift for true alignment in body, mind and spirit.

I send a recording of the session to you. DO YOU WORK BY TAPE?:YesBRIEF STATEMENT: Each of us is an incarnation of soul, on a unique journey to learn about what it’s like to live in bodies like these with others doing the same thing. At times we need to identify what that journey is all about, at other times we need to become willing to show who we know we really are. At still others we’re faced with looking our fears in the eye and choosing to live our lives anyway, and then there are times when we need parts of ourselves split off at some point in our karmic history to return so that we can proceed with what we came here to do. I combine evolutionary astrology, mediumship, channeling and shamanism to help you connect to what your soul is here to do.Each of us has a soul on a journey to discover what it means to live in a place like this in bodies like these, and there come times when each of us needs guidance and reflection to support that journey. Our personalities are expert at devising defense strategies that can keep us from living our soul missions, and my work shows you your strategies with clarity, compassion and humor, while offering practical routes for you to work through them and get on with what you came here to do.
DAVE JAQUISH ADDRESS: 389 East 89th Street, #9C, New York, NY 10128 PHONE: 646-924-5205 EMAIL: davejaquish@msn.com LEVEL: 2 DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK? YES  DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? YESDO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? YES BRIEF STATEMENT: The Soul in each one of us is something mysterious, magical and eternal. Though it often seems to remain behind the scenes, it is always trying to break through with a message. It wants us to be happy, creative and to live a meaningful life. We may receive its guidance through dreams, quiet listening or intuition. We may also receive its message through the astrological symbols. The symbols of the chart offer guidance on how to heal the pain of the present, as well as past life traumas, teaching strategies on how to release what you have outgrown, how to actualize and unfold your inner potential, and move forward with your soul’s intent this lifetime. I will discuss all of this in depth, including how the healing and self-actualizing process relates to family, life partners, career matters, personal growth, transformation and rebirth. I weave humor, allegorical stories and compassionate understanding into each reading. My ultimate goal is to use the language of the symbols to help you achieve greater self-awareness and feel empowered to make more enlightened choices. I have studied and taught metaphysics for over 30 years. I have MA and BSc degrees from Washington State University, and ran a structural dynamics lab for over 20 years, having always been interested in where science and metaphysics meet. I have focused on the practice of astrology for the past 8 years, and provide natal and current event readings for individuals, as well as composite analysis of relationships and synastry readings for couples.

Brief Statement: My approach to astrology is all about self-study and transformation. “The stars incline, they do not decide” is the ancient saying. I truly believe that nothing is ever set in stone and that free will is our natural state. That said, we do have our karmic proclivities; some are experienced as cosmic toe-stubbers and others are situations of harmonious gracefulness. It’s my job as an astrologer to bring these proclivities to the client’s attention. Then, armed with greater awareness, the client is empowered to do the kriya (take the action) and make the changes which will bring balance to their creation.

DOROTHY BARR  ADDRESS: CORNUBIA, AUSTRALIA PHONE: +61 (0) 438253060 E-mail: dbworkshops@yahoo.com.au  Level: 1 DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK?: Yes  DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE?: Yes, &amp; Skype DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: “Why have you chosen to be here, on this planet, at this time” It is not by accident!! Evolutionary Astrology can provide you with a valuable key to understanding your Souls story and to discover what you have chosen to experience in this lifetime. It offers an amazing opportunity to heal the timeline and move forward in your evolutionary journey. Your Natal Chart is the most powerful tool to self-understanding, self-empowerment, and how to live your life authentically, thereby bringing a greater sense of peace, harmony and purpose to your life.I have been studying Astrology for over 30years, beginning with a correspondence course in Cosmobiology with Doris Greaves whilst living in PNG. After moving to South Africa, I gained an Advanced Diploma in Astrospychology with Maureen Demot.&nbsp;Returning to live in Australia, I wanted to begin sharing Astrology in an experiential way which would allow Therapists and Practitioners of other modalities to provide a valuable key for them to understand more about their clients, their challenges and potentials. I created and began teaching my own course, and have been teaching and sharing this for 20 years.&nbsp;When I discovered Steven Forrest’s Evolutionary Astrology, I felt as though I had “come home”, it resonated so deeply with me, and excited my passion for Astrology to an even greater height. I am also a Louise Hay “Heal Your Life” Facilitator, and Aura-Soma Teacher to Advanced Level.&nbsp; I have combined the 2 ancient wisdom systems of Astrology and Colour into a “Soul Paths” workshop which offers an experience of the Soul Journey through a visible and glorious reflection in colour.
KAREN BART ADDRESS: Brooklyn, NY&nbsp; PHONE:&nbsp;347-349-2661 EMAIL:&nbsp;Blueststar21@gmail.com WEBSITE: Findyourvoiceastrology.com LEVEL: Master  DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK? Yes&nbsp; DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes&nbsp; DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: Thirty years ago I made my way to Mason’s Bookshop, a metaphysical book store on Lexington Avenue in New York near Bloomingdales. I was interested in metaphysics and looking forward to my first astrological reading. I knew that we’re all born with a purpose and life challenges and sensed there was other work I was meant to do.
Zoltan Mason strongly encouraged me to study astrology as he pointed to relevant planets and signs in my chart, saying I’d do well with both “a vocation and an avocation”. It was all quite interesting. I bought two books and left with good insights, but was less than satisfied with the approach of how he described the gloomy influence of the planet Saturn in terms of what it could do for me and others. Still, he pointed to other places in my chart where I could overcome and balance such influences. At the time I was a Pan American “Stewardess”. Adventure and freedom ranked high on my list, and just slightly below my quest to find love along with a strong desire to help people. I used my opportunities to travel to bring toys and clothing to orphanages abroad. As years passed, I did find love, had a family of my own, worked in the business world and flew for another airline. Somewhere in there I pulled out those two books and read them and my interest was rekindled; however, it was only after I met and studied with Steven Forrest and learned the Evolutionary approach, that my love for this art was truly awakened.
I got that nothing in your birthchart is “bad”. Understanding this empowered me to develop a deeper awareness of SELF, be more compassionate, and get clear as to my path, which has led me to better decisions. Evolutionary astrology can unravel mysteries from the past that can then be turned around into something that works for you. It’s about identifying your areas of challenge and strength, and seeing how you self-express into the world. At every moment we have the ability to shift and transcend our focus to create a happier, more satisfying life.

DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS?: Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: My astrological “scientific observation” began at age sixteen. But it reached maturity in 1998 when I began formal studies with my mentors Steven Forrest and Demetra George and started consulting with clients. I’m a Massage Therapist and an Evolutionary Astrology. I’ve found that both disciplines allow me to follow the cycles and evolving patterns unfolding within us and around us. Astrology charts our personal journey and cues us to the optimum times for expanding self-awareness. One of my favorite things about astrology is that it is an ancient symbolic language rooted in mankind’s mythological past. By applying technique, mythic stories and intuition, I hope to shed a little more light upon “all this joy and pain,” as Goethe says. Astrology links the mundane and the cosmic and shows us the “middle ground” so that we may respond to life with greater insight, less fear and a deeper understand of our unique purpose.
PATRICIA BECHDOLT, Th.D.ADDRESS: Los Angeles, CAPHONE: 323-829-8086EMAIL: PatriciaBechdolt@aol.comWEBSITE: www.IntegrativeAstrology.com LEVEL: Master DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK? NODO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? YES DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? YES, on CDBRIEF STATEMENT: Your natal astrological chart reflects the unique pattern of the planets in the sky at the moment of your birth. It provides a set of living, dynamic directions for understanding and activating your life’s purpose in a way that feels authentic, productive, and invigorating. Your chart also lends insight into past and current circumstances, which can help you to harmonize your choices in the present moment with that larger view of your soul’s intention for your life, and to create a future aligned with your deepest sense of meaning. Patricia teaches Evolutionary Astrology at Holos University, where she earned a doctorate in Theology and Spiritual Healing with an extended emphasis in Energy Medicine and Medical Intuition. Her doctoral studies included intensives with the widely respected medical intuitive, spiritual teacher, and author Caroline Myss, Ph.D., and energy medicine pioneer and American Holistic Medical Association Founder C. Norman Shealy, M.D., Ph.D. She has also completed nearly 200 hours of in-person study with Steven Forrest. Patricia has a Los Angeles-based astrology practice with clients worldwide.
 LORI BELL  ADDRESS: &nbsp;Miami Beach, Florida&nbsp; PHONE:&nbsp;305-674-1188 E-mail:&nbsp;bellalori@gmail.com WEB SITE:&nbsp;www.loribellacupuncture.com Level: 1 DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK?: Yes&nbsp; DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes. I also offer readings via Skype. DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Phone and in-person sessions are taped. BRIEF STATEMENT:&nbsp;I discovered astrology when I was 13; living at boarding school, fascinated by my roommate’s astrology book which became mine. A world opened for me that has become a lifelong study.&nbsp; A seeker since I was very young, I was drawn to the ideas and perspective of astrology. I always felt there was so much more going on than what is immediately visible, and I wanted to know more. Astrology was that beginning for me. It became a life long process, at this point a 40+ year study, which continues to inform what I do as a health practitioner, and my own life. I’ve experienced the compatibility between astrology and my practice as acupuncturist with clients dealing with health, life challenges, and life in general.
Working with Evolutionary Astrology has been an empowering experience.&nbsp;I see we are all created with a purpose and life challenges. Understanding my own chart allowed me to develop a deeper more compassionate relationship with myself. At every moment I feel I have abilities and tools to create a joyful, successful journey, as well as opportunities for transformation and change.&nbsp; It has helped me navigate some challenging periods, and negotiate relationships with more peace, grace and love. Knowing your natal chart provides insight into the complexities and patterns at work in one’s life–and what a particular time suggests.&nbsp;Along with this insight one sees the innate strengths they are endowed with to meet the challenges of their life, as well as areas where inertia is more likely.&nbsp;This experience often becomes a catalyst towards greater self-acceptance, actualizing potential, and action.&nbsp;My interest is healing, understanding and communicating the integrity in someone’s chart.&nbsp;&nbsp;

MARK BETTINSON ADDRESS: 1 Carey Ave. Burlington, MA 01803 PHONE: (617) 308-4289 EMAIL: markbettinson@aol.com  LEVEL: Master DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK? Yes DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes (telephone or Skype) DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: Mark Bettinson is a nine year student of Steven Forrest’s evolutionary and compassionate thinking and a thirty year student and teacher of Astrology in general. He has discovered two unique and reliable perspectives on the birth chart that reveal key developmental sequences in our lifetime. The Life Point can be seen to begin on the Mid-Heaven/Nadir Axis and progress on an 84 year cycle of contact with the natal karma. The Soul Point represents an integration of the Lunar Phase of Birth with the Zodiac. The progression of this point on a 29.5 year cycle also reveals a reliable indicator of the archetypes that you are either manifesting or responding to at particular times in your life.
Having lived in the “real” world of business, marriage, divorce, child-rearing, college education and home ownership, I am now approaching the sixth decade of my life. I am blessed and comforted in the understanding and context that Astrological symbolism has offered me. I have found no better “Window on my own Divinity” than my Birth Chart. Naturally, the symbolism means nothing without the good and supportive friends and community that fill out my life. You are part of that divinity also. As I move into my years of “maturity”, I eagerly commit to share my perspectives with those who wish to explore this magical world with me.

Astrology has helped me through so many times of change and upset that I want to share my knowledge with you. I am a life-long student of astrology and metaphysics having become interested in astrology at the age of 12. Shortly after my first Saturn return I completed a two-year course in metaphysics and earned my Respondere’ degrree at the School of Metaphysics.
At my second Saturn return I decided to make astrology my life’s work and completed a four-year, intense course of study at the International Academy of Astrology in January 2008. I discovered Steven Forrest at the Denver UAC conference and knew that his training was the only missing link to my astrological knowledge. Evolutionary astrology brings all of the pieces of your birth chart together in an amazing way! I can give you a road map of your strengths and weaknesses and coach you on how to maximize your strengths and minimize your weaknesses to transform your life. No matter what you may be going through there is always a positive, effective way to turn matters around for the good of all. I would be honored to help you in your life journey through the power of astrology. To schedule an evolutionary astrology reading contact me at evolutionary astrology reading. I am also accepting a limited number of students for astrology classes. To sign up for an astrology class contact me at astrology classes.

Yes DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: I approach each astrological reading I do as a dialogue of learning and understanding with another – a gift that I hope will honor what I believe is a sacred profession. Cara is the Celtic word for “friend,” a name I believe reflects the spirit of engagement I encourage with my clients, offering astrological insight in support of individual freedom and choice. I am an evolutionary astrologer working in Santa Cruz County. I began my journey with astrology thirty years ago, teaching myself how to read charts and how to follow changing patterns in the sky as a young woman in my twenties. As the years passed, I learned and I absorbed, reading the classic studies in astrology and continuing to teach myself. Meanwhile, in the 1990s, I became a full-time college professor of art history, a field in which I earned a Ph.D. in my early thirties. My daily work as an art historian revolved around visual symbols, patterns and compositions – not unlike analyzing the visual workings of a birthchart – a type of symbolic mandala of the soul. Having a lifelong goal to write, teach and counsel in the professional realm of astrology, I continued my passion for study, eventually deciding to pursue more formal training as an evolutionary astrologer through the Steven Forrest Apprenticeship Program in 2014. It is a great honor to have Steven Forrest as a mentor and teacher. I immersed myself in the program, taking over a dozen workshops&nbsp;in two years, successfully completing a master certificate in 2016. In addition to ongoing work and study with Steven in the Apprenticeship Program, I regularly attend professional conferences and workshops in astrology, write astrological essays and strive to be an active participant in the growing, global astrological community.

First, we discover our personality. What are my strengths and weaknesses? Where must I build, and where must I release? What is my fundamental approach toward life, and how does it feel to me? Second, we journey into the invisible realm of our karma. What have I mastered in previous lives, and what are my pitfalls? How can I gain a sense of strength to conquer unchartered territory? And thirdly–and most uniquely—we learn how to dedicate our lives to Earth. In the final chapter of the interpretation we dive into our most fundamental drive toward life. We humans are a unique mixture of Earth and Universe, meant to hold the two together. We ask: What does Earth wish me to do with my life? How can I create a more harmonious marriage between Earth and Universe through my actions? Where in my chart does Earth teach me how to use her strength to grasp the hidden corners of universal truth? Readings last roughly two hours and cost $125.

I am also happy to email written readings. BRIEF STATEMENT: We are not in this World by chance! We are here by choice! For each of us has very specific lessons to learn that are different from another’s! We attract into our lives the people and situations we most need to learn from. How well we learn depends on our attitude – and the choices we make. Our birthchart is the blueprint of our uniqueness which sets us apart from every other individual on the planet. It contains clues to our gifts…and our challenges. Understanding ourselves through this blueprint is a wonderful (and ongoing) tool for growth. Evolutionary Astrology can help us lead a more empowered life and a more conscious journey. It can help us identify the patterns we are trying to work through; navigate the rocky shores and ocean swells that face us every day; heal and; realize our potential. It is one powerful tool. I believe in utopian altruism and my quest is to help others towards this ideal through the realization of their individual potential and innate spiritual nature. We need more awareness and light on the planet if we are to help raise the vibration of the Earth and create a healthier future.

She holds certificates in Palmistry and Numerology and is a professional Member of the Tarot Guild of Australia. She teaches all these disciplines as well as conducting consultations and finds the synergy obtained from integrating these sources of wisdom can be awe inspiring. Sara believes that astrology presents you with a wonderful blueprint of the energy patterns that were created at your birth, to map out your soul’s potential in this incarnation. It provides the ability to understand how the current positions and passages of the stars in the sky can be used to optimise your journey through life. Evolutionary Astrology provides added insight into feelings and patterns of behaviour that have been carried forward from unfinished business in past lifetimes and looks at the areas of life where this can be brought to consciousness and healed this time around. Sara is strongly drawn to myth and goddess energy, she is currently researching the impact of a series of the more magical and oracular asteroids in the charts of individuals drawn to the healing and oracular arts. She finds this can brings valuable connections for those seeking to find their way forward through their life issues.

YesDO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? YesBRIEF STATEMENT:&nbsp;One thing that has always stuck with me is that when I look at the Milky Way in the night sky, I intuitively know I am part of something bigger and grander then myself. Why am I here? How is it all connected? Can I get it all right in one lifetime? My journey into astrology to answer these questions has led me to explore many systems of astrology; the omen-based divinations of the Babylonians, and the Western astrological techniques from the Greeks to Sydney Omarr's little astrological cookbooks that I would religiously buy every January. Through it all, evolutionary astrology has come out the winner in answering all those questions I had. We 'come with directions', and if you take the time to read them, you find yourself more confident in making choices. You begin to understand yourself, to accept yourself...to know yourself. Let me help you find your peace.

I am a counselor, doing my best work over time by using the chart as a guide to in-depth exploration of the inner landscape. My style is warm, humorous and earthy, and my emphasis is on your experience and perceptions rather than a rigid “definition” of your astrological patterns. I am particularly dedicated to supporting people in “taboo” areas, working with emotionally frightening and/or “socially unacceptable” material. It can be difficult to find compassionate yet honest ways of working with these subjects, relatively free of the Western social judgments about them. I believe that wholeness is the most core human desire, and nothing in the chart is inherently “good” or “bad.” It is an image of our own wholeness, and this image can be particularly valuable to those struggling with “marginalized” aspects of themselves. I am thrilled to be in the initial class of Kepler College, a groundbreaking college of astrological history, technique and synthesis. My Kepler classes have deepened and developed my understanding of astrology’s underlying principles and lost methods, which I continue to weave into my psychological and evolutionary approach.

AMY HERRING  ADDRESS: Seattle, WA EMAIL: amy@heavenlytruth.comWEBSITE: http://www.heavenlytruth.com  LEVEL: Master DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK? Yes DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes BRIEF STATEMENT: I aim at making my readings feel like a talk with an insightful friend — someone who is compassionate and helpful, but who will also be honest with you. An astrology reading should strive to go much deeper into the birth chart and ask the ‘whys’ about your behavior patterns, the ‘what’s about your spirit’s life plans and goals, and the ‘hows’ in order to help you create the life you want. This is the philosophy that guides my readings, to not only strive to support you in making changes you want to bring about in your life but also to find the valuable things in you that are hidden and uncover them.
I use astrology toward the purpose of creating self-awareness in people, to enable them to see and honor themselves, and to have the courage to be honest with themselves to allow healing and change to take place where it’s needed. No one can tell you definitively who you are. Ultimately, the inner workings of any individual are mysterious and deserve to be examined and experienced with respect and reverence. It is sometimes by studying a reflection or interpretation of you that can lead you to deeper insight. That is all I ever hope for in every reading I offer.

Yes  DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes and on Skype DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes  BRIEF STATEMENT: I am a Professional Astrologer, a PSYCH-K Facilitator, Reiki Practitioner and Intuitive Counselor. Astrology is an intrinsic part of my personal journey in conscious awakening. Its introduction provided the energetic shift onto the spiritual path I needed through satisfying a lifelong desire to know myself and understand human nature. That led to my initiation into spiritual wisdom by my first astrological mentor and then a subsequent mystery school. Having exposure to both frameworks at the same time provided the understanding that the astrological chart is a personal road map and enhancement to any spiritual practice, or modality for living your personal best and seeking spiritual awakening. Through Steven’s Evolutionary Astrology mentorship I’ve grown in my ability to communicate the chart’s symbolism and incorporate the intersection of spirituality and mythology as part of that. For the client my goal is to provide insight and perspective. Understanding how energy works and beliefs create our reality through the other modalities I work in brings a multi level enhancement to the astrological consultation. I offer a full selection of astrological services including packaged services. The deep insight astrology offers married with the rewiring of beliefs supported by PSYCH-K offers a potent energetic shift for true alignment in body, mind and spirit.

I send a recording of the session to you. DO YOU WORK BY TAPE?:YesBRIEF STATEMENT: Each of us is an incarnation of soul, on a unique journey to learn about what it’s like to live in bodies like these with others doing the same thing. At times we need to identify what that journey is all about, at other times we need to become willing to show who we know we really are. At still others we’re faced with looking our fears in the eye and choosing to live our lives anyway, and then there are times when we need parts of ourselves split off at some point in our karmic history to return so that we can proceed with what we came here to do. I combine evolutionary astrology, mediumship, channeling and shamanism to help you connect to what your soul is here to do.Each of us has a soul on a journey to discover what it means to live in a place like this in bodies like these, and there come times when each of us needs guidance and reflection to support that journey. Our personalities are expert at devising defense strategies that can keep us from living our soul missions, and my work shows you your strategies with clarity, compassion and humor, while offering practical routes for you to work through them and get on with what you came here to do.

YESDO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? YES BRIEF STATEMENT: The Soul in each one of us is something mysterious, magical and eternal. Though it often seems to remain behind the scenes, it is always trying to break through with a message. It wants us to be happy, creative and to live a meaningful life. We may receive its guidance through dreams, quiet listening or intuition. We may also receive its message through the astrological symbols. The symbols of the chart offer guidance on how to heal the pain of the present, as well as past life traumas, teaching strategies on how to release what you have outgrown, how to actualize and unfold your inner potential, and move forward with your soul’s intent this lifetime. I will discuss all of this in depth, including how the healing and self-actualizing process relates to family, life partners, career matters, personal growth, transformation and rebirth. I weave humor, allegorical stories and compassionate understanding into each reading. My ultimate goal is to use the language of the symbols to help you achieve greater self-awareness and feel empowered to make more enlightened choices. I have studied and taught metaphysics for over 30 years. I have MA and BSc degrees from Washington State University, and ran a structural dynamics lab for over 20 years, having always been interested in where science and metaphysics meet. I have focused on the practice of astrology for the past 8 years, and provide natal and current event readings for individuals, as well as composite analysis of relationships and synastry readings for couples.

Brief Statement: My approach to astrology is all about self-study and transformation. “The stars incline, they do not decide” is the ancient saying. I truly believe that nothing is ever set in stone and that free will is our natural state. That said, we do have our karmic proclivities; some are experienced as cosmic toe-stubbers and others are situations of harmonious gracefulness. It’s my job as an astrologer to bring these proclivities to the client’s attention. Then, armed with greater awareness, the client is empowered to do the kriya (take the action) and make the changes which will bring balance to their creation.

drumming dancing way stillness.” durch ihren symbolismus fördert evolutionäre astrologie selbsterkenntnis, akzeptanz und ehrlichkeit kann dadurch das individuum unterstützen, konstruktive lösungen für

begleitet von einigen wunderbaren lehrern meiner eigenen spirituellen psychologischen selbsterkenntnis gewidmet. 1999 neben persönlichen astrologischen beratungen auch gemeinsam projekt “afrikanisches trommeln tanzen weg zur stille” mitgearbeitet. evoluutioastrologia tukee itsetuntemuksen, rehellisyyden ja itsehyväksynnän tuomia yksilöllisiä valintoja. minulle se on työkalu, jonka symboliikan avulla voin yhdistää maailmankaikkeuden ihmeen arkipäiväisiin tilanteisiin ratkaisuihin. olen opiskellut astrologiaa kahdenkymmenen vuoden ajan osallistunut muun muassa luentoihin kursseihin psykologisen astrologian keskuksessa lontoossa. sen palasen, koin aina perinteisestä astrologiasta puuttuvan, löysin kuitenkin vasta tutustuttani forrest evoluutioastrologiaan. nuo kaksikymmentä vuotta käyttänyt omien henkisten psykologisten muuttumisprosessien parissa monien suuresti arvostamieni opettajien peilissä. viimeiset viisi astrologisten tulkintojen lisäksi työskennelyt intensiivisesti kercherin kanssa vetäen kursseja otsikolla “afrikkalainen tanssi rummutus siltana hiljaisuuteen.” tricia kennedyaddress: adelaide, australiaemail: ask@misstreewoman.com web site:

It offers an amazing opportunity to heal the timeline and move forward in your evolutionary journey. Your Natal Chart is the most powerful tool to self-understanding, self-empowerment, and how to live your life authentically, thereby bringing a greater sense of peace, harmony and purpose to your life.I have been studying Astrology for over 30years, beginning with a correspondence course in Cosmobiology with Doris Greaves whilst living in PNG. After moving to South Africa, I gained an Advanced Diploma in Astrospychology with Maureen Demot.&nbsp;Returning to live in Australia, I wanted to begin sharing Astrology in an experiential way which would allow Therapists and Practitioners of other modalities to provide a valuable key for them to understand more about their clients, their challenges and potentials. I created and began teaching my own course, and have been teaching and sharing this for 20 years.&nbsp;When I discovered Steven Forrest’s Evolutionary Astrology, I felt as though I had “come home”, it resonated so deeply with me, and excited my passion for Astrology to an even greater height. I am also a Louise Hay “Heal Your Life” Facilitator, and Aura-Soma Teacher to Advanced Level.&nbsp; I have combined the 2 ancient wisdom systems of Astrology and Colour into a “Soul Paths” workshop which offers an experience of the Soul Journey through a visible and glorious reflection in colour.</p>

Yes&nbsp;<br> DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes&nbsp;<br> DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes<br> BRIEF STATEMENT:<br> <span lang="EN-GB">Thirty years ago I made my way to Mason’s Bookshop, a metaphysical book store on Lexington Avenue in New York near Bloomingdales. I was interested in metaphysics and looking forward to my first astrological reading. I knew that we’re all born with a purpose and life challenges and sensed there was other work I was meant to do.<u></u></span></p> 
             <p><span lang="EN-GB">Zoltan Mason strongly encouraged me to study astrology as he pointed to relevant planets and signs in my chart, saying I’d do well with both “a vocation and an avocation”. It was all quite interesting. I bought two books and left with good insights, but was less than satisfied with the approach of how he described the gloomy influence of the planet Saturn in terms of what it could do for me and others. Still, he pointed to other places in my chart where I could overcome and balance such influences. At the time I was a Pan American “Stewardess”. Adventure and freedom ranked high on my list, and just slightly below my quest to find love along with a strong desire to help people. I used my opportunities to travel to bring toys and clothing to orphanages abroad. As years passed, I did find love, had a family of my own, worked in the business world and flew for another airline. Somewhere in there I pulled out those two books and read them and my interest was rekindled; however, it was only after I met and studied with Steven Forrest and learned the Evolutionary approach, that my love for this art was truly awakened.<u></u></span></p> 
             <p><span lang="EN-GB">I got that nothing in your birthchart is “bad”. Understanding this empowered me to develop a deeper awareness of SELF, be more compassionate, and get clear as to my path, which has led me to better decisions. Evolutionary astrology can unravel mysteries from the past that can then be turned around into something that works for you. It’s about identifying your areas of challenge and strength, and seeing how you self-express into the world. At every moment we have the ability to shift and transcend our focus to create a happier, more satisfying life. As it has empowered me to find my own voice, it would be my pleasure to see you claim yours.</span></p>

But it reached maturity in 1998 when I began formal studies with my mentors Steven Forrest and Demetra George and started consulting with clients. I’m a Massage Therapist and an Evolutionary Astrology. I’ve found that both disciplines allow me to follow the cycles and evolving patterns unfolding within us and around us. Astrology charts our personal journey and cues us to the optimum times for expanding self-awareness. One of my favorite things about astrology is that it is an ancient symbolic language rooted in mankind’s mythological past. By applying technique, mythic stories and intuition, I hope to shed a little more light upon “all this joy and pain,” as Goethe says. Astrology links the mundane and the cosmic and shows us the “middle ground” so that we may respond to life with greater insight, less fear and a deeper understand of our unique purpose.</p>

YES, on CD<br>BRIEF STATEMENT: Your natal astrological chart reflects the unique pattern of the planets in the sky at the moment of your birth. It provides a set of living, dynamic directions for understanding and activating your life’s purpose in a way that feels authentic, productive, and invigorating. Your chart also lends insight into past and current circumstances, which can help you to harmonize your choices in the present moment with that larger view of your soul’s intention for your life, and to create a future aligned with your deepest sense of meaning. Patricia teaches Evolutionary Astrology at Holos University, where she earned a doctorate in Theology and Spiritual Healing with an extended emphasis in Energy Medicine and Medical Intuition. Her doctoral studies included intensives with the widely respected medical intuitive, spiritual teacher, and author Caroline Myss, Ph.D., and energy medicine pioneer and American Holistic Medical Association Founder C.

Yes. I also offer readings via Skype.<br> DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Phone and in-person sessions are taped.<br> BRIEF STATEMENT:&nbsp;I discovered astrology when I was 13; living at boarding school, fascinated by my roommate’s astrology book which became mine. A world opened for me that has become a lifelong study.&nbsp; A seeker since I was very young, I was drawn to the ideas and perspective of astrology. I always felt there was so much more going on than what is immediately visible, and I wanted to know more. Astrology was that beginning for me. It became a life long process, at this point a 40+ year study, which continues to inform what I do as a health practitioner, and my own life. I’ve experienced the compatibility between astrology and my practice as acupuncturist with clients dealing with health, life challenges, and life in general.</p> 
             <p>Working with Evolutionary Astrology has been an empowering experience.&nbsp;I see we are all created with a purpose and life challenges. Understanding my own chart allowed me to develop a deeper more compassionate relationship with myself. At every moment I feel I have abilities and tools to create a joyful, successful journey, as well as opportunities for transformation and change.&nbsp; It has helped me navigate some challenging periods, and negotiate relationships with more peace, grace and love. Knowing your natal chart provides insight into the complexities and patterns at work in one’s life–and what a particular time suggests.&nbsp;Along with this insight one sees the innate strengths they are endowed with to meet the challenges of their life, as well as areas where inertia is more likely.&nbsp;This experience often becomes a catalyst towards greater self-acceptance, actualizing potential, and action.&nbsp;My interest is healing, understanding and communicating the integrity in someone’s chart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Yes <br>BRIEF STATEMENT: <br>Mark Bettinson is a nine year student of Steven Forrest’s evolutionary and compassionate thinking and a thirty year student and teacher of Astrology in general. He has discovered two unique and reliable perspectives on the birth chart that reveal key developmental sequences in our lifetime. The Life Point can be seen to begin on the Mid-Heaven/Nadir Axis and progress on an 84 year cycle of contact with the natal karma. The Soul Point represents an integration of the Lunar Phase of Birth with the Zodiac. The progression of this point on a 29.5 year cycle also reveals a reliable indicator of the archetypes that you are either manifesting or responding to at particular times in your life.</p> 
             <p>Having lived in the “real” world of business, marriage, divorce, child-rearing, college education and home ownership, I am now approaching the sixth decade of my life. I am blessed and comforted in the understanding and context that Astrological symbolism has offered me. I have found no better “Window on my own Divinity” than my Birth Chart. Naturally, the symbolism means nothing without the good and supportive friends and community that fill out my life. You are part of that divinity also. As I move into my years of “maturity”, I eagerly commit to share my perspectives with those who wish to explore this magical world with me.</p>

Blaschke (Earthwalk School of Astrology); teacher, speaker and author of the <em>Astrology: A Language of Life</em> series. Amy’s interest in astrology has grown and expanded since childhood, beginning with the seeds of engaging conversation planted by her father. In 2013 Amy’s passion for Astrology reached new levels when she started studying Evolutionary Astrology with Steven Forrest. Amy believes that Evolutionary Astrology is a powerful philosophy, technique and framework of guidance, to help individuals discover, connect and be reminded of each individual’s intended evolutionary path in this life. She is a certified Evolutionary Astrologer and approaches each session with humility, excitement, wonder and compassion for the human soul’s passage through life and beyond.</p>

Yes <br>BRIEF STATEMENT: Twenty-two years ago when I was beginning my counseling practice, I had a vivid visualization of receiving a box of custom-made rings that I was to distribute to others. Six years later when I had my birth chart read, I realized that astrology was the perfect match for the symbol: offering others a one-of-a-kind ring of their very own. As an evolutionary astrologer I bring both spiritual and psychological perspective to the work, seeking to engender trust in each person’s innate gifts and soulful challenges.</p>

She has over 20 years of experience in transformational modalities including psychotherapy, Somatic Experiencing, bodywork, authentic movement, nature based practices and vision quests. Her deepest informant, however, is the wisdom gleaned through the unfolding of her own spiritual path. Through gentle yet fierce attunement, she facilitates others in shedding limiting stories, identities, and patterns and opening to what naturally wants to bloom. Kerry has served as faculty at Animas Valley Institute and the California Institute of Integral Studies where she and Brian Swimme co-teach Nature and Eros – an exploration into what it is to live in participatory engagement within a living universe and in more authentic alignment with the cultural and ecological shift of our time. Her nature based retreats invite a more intimate engagement with all of life, seamlessly weaving the personal, ecological and cosmological aspects of our being into one fluid whole.</p>

Astrology has helped me through so many times of change and upset that I want to share my knowledge with you. I am a life-long student of astrology and metaphysics having become interested in astrology at the age of 12. Shortly after my first Saturn return I completed a two-year course in metaphysics and earned my Respondere’ degrree at the School of Metaphysics.</p> 
             <p>At my second Saturn return I decided to make astrology my life’s work and completed a four-year, intense course of study at the International Academy of Astrology in January 2008. I discovered Steven Forrest at the Denver UAC conference and knew that his training was the only missing link to my astrological knowledge. Evolutionary astrology brings all of the pieces of your birth chart together in an amazing way! I can give you a road map of your strengths and weaknesses and coach you on how to maximize your strengths and minimize your weaknesses to transform your life. No matter what you may be going through there is always a positive, effective way to turn matters around for the good of all. I would be honored to help you in your life journey through the power of astrology. To schedule an evolutionary astrology reading contact me at <a href="http://astrologer.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evolutionary astrology reading</a>. I am also accepting a limited number of students for astrology classes.

Yes<br> DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes<br> DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes<br> BRIEF STATEMENT: I approach each astrological reading I do as a dialogue of learning and understanding with another – a gift that I hope will honor what I believe is a sacred profession. Cara is the Celtic word for “friend,” a name I believe reflects the spirit of engagement I encourage with my clients, offering astrological insight in support of individual freedom and choice. I am an evolutionary astrologer working in Santa Cruz County. I began my journey with astrology thirty years ago, teaching myself how to read charts and how to follow changing patterns in the sky as a young woman in my twenties. As the years passed, I learned and I absorbed, reading the classic studies in astrology and continuing to teach myself. Meanwhile, in the 1990s, I became a full-time college professor of art history, a field in which I earned a Ph.D. in my early thirties. My daily work as an art historian revolved around visual symbols, patterns and compositions – not unlike analyzing the visual workings of a birthchart – a type of symbolic mandala of the soul. Having a lifelong goal to write, teach and counsel in the professional realm of astrology, I continued my passion for study, eventually deciding to pursue more formal training as an evolutionary astrologer through the Steven Forrest Apprenticeship Program in 2014. It is a great honor to have Steven Forrest as a mentor and teacher. I immersed myself in the program, taking over a dozen workshops&nbsp;<span data-term="goog_1568444315" tabindex="0">in two years</span>, successfully completing a master certificate in 2016. In addition to ongoing work and study with Steven in the Apprenticeship Program, I regularly attend professional conferences and workshops in astrology, write astrological essays and strive to be an active participant in the growing, global astrological community.

I believe when someone books in with me they are wanting to make something knowable to ignite change in their life. Astrology is the science of Human nature giving us symbols as sign post to understand ourselves from within – meaning how do we tick. This makes it an amazing tool for discovering our hearts connection to ‘What has gone – to what is now – to where we want to travel too. When I began on this path I felt I was given a KEY to open doors and now it’s 26 yrs later and I’m still inspired and in awe of this profound knowledge system that has taken me on the most insightful heart beat of my life and I wouldn’t swap it for anything in the World. The multi dimensions of our life is like reading the pages of your own personal book giving us choice via the understanding one gains by having our charts interrupted by a qualified guide.</p>

First, we discover our personality. What are my strengths and weaknesses? Where must I build, and where must I release? What is my fundamental approach toward life, and how does it feel to me? Second, we journey into the invisible realm of our karma. What have I mastered in previous lives, and what are my pitfalls? How can I gain a sense of strength to conquer unchartered territory? And thirdly–and most uniquely—we learn how to dedicate our lives to Earth. In the final chapter of the interpretation we dive into our most fundamental drive toward life. We humans are a unique mixture of Earth and Universe, meant to hold the two together. We ask: What does Earth wish me to do with my life? How can I create a more harmonious marriage between Earth and Universe through my actions? Where in my chart does Earth teach me how to use her strength to grasp the hidden corners of universal truth? Readings last roughly two hours and cost $125.</p>

I am also happy to email written readings. <br>BRIEF STATEMENT: We are not in this World by chance! We are here by choice! For each of us has very specific lessons to learn that are different from another’s! We attract into our lives the people and situations we most need to learn from. How well we learn depends on our attitude – and the choices we make. Our birthchart is the blueprint of our uniqueness which sets us apart from every other individual on the planet. It contains clues to our gifts…and our challenges. Understanding ourselves through this blueprint is a wonderful (and ongoing) tool for growth. Evolutionary Astrology can help us lead a more empowered life and a more conscious journey. It can help us identify the patterns we are trying to work through; navigate the rocky shores and ocean swells that face us every day; heal and; realize our potential. It is one powerful tool. I believe in utopian altruism and my quest is to help others towards this ideal through the realization of their individual potential and innate spiritual nature. We need more awareness and light on the planet if we are to help raise the vibration of the Earth and create a healthier future.</p>

She holds certificates in Palmistry and Numerology and is a professional Member of the Tarot Guild of Australia. She teaches all these disciplines as well as conducting consultations and finds the synergy obtained from integrating these sources of wisdom can be awe inspiring. Sara believes that astrology presents you with a wonderful blueprint of the energy patterns that were created at your birth, to map out your soul’s potential in this incarnation. It provides the ability to understand how the current positions and passages of the stars in the sky can be used to optimise your journey through life. Evolutionary Astrology provides added insight into feelings and patterns of behaviour that have been carried forward from unfinished business in past lifetimes and looks at the areas of life where this can be brought to consciousness and healed this time around. Sara is strongly drawn to myth and goddess energy, she is currently researching the impact of a series of the more magical and oracular asteroids in the charts of individuals drawn to the healing and oracular arts.

Why am I here? How is it all connected? Can I get it all right in one lifetime? My journey into astrology to answer these questions has led me to explore many systems of astrology; the omen-based divinations of the Babylonians, and the Western astrological techniques from the Greeks to Sydney Omarr's little astrological cookbooks that I would religiously buy every January. Through it all, evolutionary astrology has come out the winner in answering all those questions I had. We 'come with directions', and if you take the time to read them, you find yourself more confident in making choices. You begin to understand yourself, to accept yourself...to know yourself.

Yes<br> BRIEF STATEMENT: Your natal chart provides an excellent tool by which to navigate your life’s journey, as astrology can open the door to greater insight, transform your outlook, and empower your future! My chart readings are designed to guide you along in your journey as you examine your life purpose, your soul’s desire, your hidden strengths and talents, your inherent challenges, and your past life karma. Learn how to navigate crossroads and crises in consciousness, and give yourself the gift of astrology by using your own chart as the best imaginable guide by which to live your life to its highest and happiest potential. A Forrest-trained astrologer, and student of archetypal, psychological, and evolutionary astrology, I have studied with Steven Forrest through his Apprenticeship Program, and at the Faculty of Astrology in the U.K., the Centre for Psychological Astrology in London, and the Astrological Society of Princeton. I have had the pleasure of studying with many of the best known names in astrology, including Liz Greene, Melanie Reinhart, Demetra George, Bernadette Brady, Rob Hand, Ken Negus, Brian Clark, Joyce Hoen, Micheal Lutin, Lynn Bell, and more. Astrology is my passion, and through it I have discovered that life is a matter of choice. My mission is to inspire, transform, and empower through astrological insight!

I am a counselor, doing my best work over time by using the chart as a guide to in-depth exploration of the inner landscape. My style is warm, humorous and earthy, and my emphasis is on your experience and perceptions rather than a rigid “definition” of your astrological patterns. I am particularly dedicated to supporting people in “taboo” areas, working with emotionally frightening and/or “socially unacceptable” material. It can be difficult to find compassionate yet honest ways of working with these subjects, relatively free of the Western social judgments about them. I believe that wholeness is the most core human desire, and nothing in the chart is inherently “good” or “bad.” It is an image of our own wholeness, and this image can be particularly valuable to those struggling with “marginalized” aspects of themselves. I am thrilled to be in the initial class of <a href="http://www.kepler.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kepler College</a>, a groundbreaking college of astrological history, technique and synthesis. My Kepler classes have deepened and developed my understanding of astrology’s underlying principles and lost methods, which I continue to weave into my psychological and evolutionary approach.</p>

The astrological chart as a map of consciousness and our potentialities is a useful tool that can be applied to any area of our lives.

Yes <br>DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes <br>DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes <br>BRIEF STATEMENT: I aim at making my readings feel like a talk with an insightful friend — someone who is compassionate and helpful, but who will also be honest with you. An astrology reading should strive to go much deeper into the birth chart and ask the ‘whys’ about your behavior patterns, the ‘what’s about your spirit’s life plans and goals, and the ‘hows’ in order to help you create the life you want. This is the philosophy that guides my readings, to not only strive to support you in making changes you want to bring about in your life but also to find the valuable things in you that are hidden and uncover them.</p> 
             <p>I use astrology toward the purpose of creating self-awareness in people, to enable them to see and honor themselves, and to have the courage to be honest with themselves to allow healing and change to take place where it’s needed. No one can tell you definitively who you are. Ultimately, the inner workings of any individual are mysterious and deserve to be examined and experienced with respect and reverence. It is sometimes by studying a reflection or interpretation of you that can lead you to deeper insight. That is all I ever hope for in every reading I offer.</p>

Yes <br> BRIEF STATEMENT: I am a Professional Astrologer, a PSYCH-K Facilitator, Reiki Practitioner and Intuitive Counselor. Astrology is an intrinsic part of my personal journey in conscious awakening. Its introduction provided the energetic shift onto the spiritual path I needed through satisfying a lifelong desire to know myself and understand human nature. That led to my initiation into spiritual wisdom by my first astrological mentor and then a subsequent mystery school. Having exposure to both frameworks at the same time provided the understanding that the astrological chart is a personal road map and enhancement to any spiritual practice, or modality for living your personal best and seeking spiritual awakening. Through Steven’s Evolutionary Astrology mentorship I’ve grown in my ability to communicate the chart’s symbolism and incorporate the intersection of spirituality and mythology as part of that. For the client my goal is to provide insight and perspective. Understanding how energy works and beliefs create our reality through the other modalities I work in brings a multi level enhancement to the astrological consultation. I offer a full selection of astrological services including packaged services. The deep insight astrology offers married with the rewiring of beliefs supported by PSYCH-K offers a potent energetic shift for true alignment in body, mind and spirit.</p>

I send a recording of the session to you.<br> DO YOU WORK BY TAPE?:Yes<br>BRIEF STATEMENT: Each of us is an incarnation of soul, on a unique journey to learn about what it’s like to live in bodies like these with others doing the same thing. At times we need to identify what that journey is all about, at other times we need to become willing to show who we know we really are. At still others we’re faced with looking our fears in the eye and choosing to live our lives anyway, and then there are times when we need parts of ourselves split off at some point in our karmic history to return so that we can proceed with what we came here to do. I combine evolutionary astrology, mediumship, channeling and shamanism to help you connect to what your soul is here to do.Each of us has a soul on a journey to discover what it means to live in a place like this in bodies like these, and there come times when each of us needs guidance and reflection to support that journey. Our personalities are expert at devising defense strategies that can keep us from living our soul missions, and my work shows you your strategies with clarity, compassion and humor, while offering practical routes for you to work through them and get on with what you came here to do.</p>

YES <br> DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? YES<br>DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? YES <br>BRIEF STATEMENT: The Soul in each one of us is something mysterious, magical and eternal. Though it often seems to remain behind the scenes, it is always trying to break through with a message. It wants us to be happy, creative and to live a meaningful life. We may receive its guidance through dreams, quiet listening or intuition. We may also receive its message through the astrological symbols. The symbols of the chart offer guidance on how to heal the pain of the present, as well as past life traumas, teaching strategies on how to release what you have outgrown, how to actualize and unfold your inner potential, and move forward with your soul’s intent this lifetime. I will discuss all of this in depth, including how the healing and self-actualizing process relates to family, life partners, career matters, personal growth, transformation and rebirth. I weave humor, allegorical stories and compassionate understanding into each reading. My ultimate goal is to use the language of the symbols to help you achieve greater self-awareness and feel empowered to make more enlightened choices. <br>I have studied and taught metaphysics for over 30 years. I have MA and BSc degrees from Washington State University, and ran a structural dynamics lab for over 20 years, having always been interested in where science and metaphysics meet. I have focused on the practice of astrology for the past 8 years, and provide natal and current event readings for individuals, as well as composite analysis of relationships and synastry readings for couples.</p>

             <p><strong>Brief Statement:</strong><br> My approach to astrology is all about self-study and transformation. “The stars incline, they do not decide” is the ancient saying. I truly believe that nothing is ever set in stone and that free will is our natural state. That said, we do have our karmic proclivities; some are experienced as cosmic toe-stubbers and others are situations of harmonious gracefulness. It’s my job as an astrologer to bring these proclivities to the client’s attention. Then, armed with greater awareness, the client is empowered to do the kriya (take the action) and make the changes which will bring balance to their creation.</p>

             <p>Evolutionary astrology is a wonderful tool for developing deeper self-knowledge, acceptance and honesty. I like to use it to bring together the sense of the cosmic wonder and down to earth practical life.I have been learning astrology for twenty years, including workshops and seminars at the Centre for Psychological Astrology in London, but really found the piece that I felt was always missing in the traditional astrology, when I came into contact with Steven Forrest’s evolutionary astrology. In those twenty years I have engaged intensively in my own spiritual and therapeutical work with the help of some wonderful teachers. The last five years as well as doing astrological counseling I have worked intensively with Nils Kercher in the project “African drumming and dancing as a way to stillness.”</p> 
             <p>Durch ihren Symbolismus fördert evolutionäre Astrologie Selbsterkenntnis, Akzeptanz und Ehrlichkeit und kann dadurch das Individuum unterstützen, konstruktive Lösungen für das eigene Leben zu finden. Ich nütze sie als ein praktisches Werkzeug, um die kosmische Perspektive des Ganzen mit dem alltäglichen Leben zu verbinden. Seit über 20 Jahren beschäftige ich mich intensiv mit Astrologie und habe u.a.an Seminaren am Zentrum für psychologische Astrologie in London teilgenommen. In Steven Forrests Ansatz der Evolutinären Astrologie habe ich den Aspekt finden können, der mir bei der herkömmlichen Atrologie immer gefehlt hatte. Diese 20 Jahre habe ich gleichzeitig — begleitet von einigen <br>wunderbaren Lehrern — meiner eigenen spirituellen und psychologischen Selbsterkenntnis gewidmet. Seit 1999 habe ich neben persönlichen astrologischen Beratungen auch gemeinsam mit Nils Kercher intensiv am Projekt “Afrikanisches Trommeln und Tanzen als Weg zur Stille” mitgearbeitet.</p> 
             <p>Evoluutioastrologia tukee itsetuntemuksen, rehellisyyden ja itsehyväksynnän tuomia yksilöllisiä valintoja. Minulle se on työkalu, jonka symboliikan avulla voin yhdistää maailmankaikkeuden ihmeen arkipäiväisiin tilanteisiin ja ratkaisuihin. Olen opiskellut astrologiaa kahdenkymmenen vuoden ajan ja osallistunut muun muassa luentoihin ja kursseihin Psykologisen astrologian <br>keskuksessa Lontoossa. Sen palasen, jonka koin aina perinteisestä astrologiasta puuttuvan, löysin kuitenkin vasta tutustuttani Steven Forrest in evoluutioastrologiaan. Nuo kaksikymmentä vuotta olen käyttänyt omien henkisten ja psykologisten muuttumisprosessien parissa monien suuresti arvostamieni opettajien peilissä. Viimeiset viisi vuotta olen astrologisten tulkintojen lisäksi työskennelyt intensiivisesti Nils Kercherin kanssa vetäen kursseja otsikolla “Afrikkalainen tanssi ja rummutus siltana hiljaisuuteen.”</p>

Sessions delivered by email in MP3 format or CD by request.<br>BRIEF STATEMENT:An astrology reading can be as simple as having a ‘look under the hood’ and finding out how your being is set-up, how it is working and, moreover, how it could work better. It can also be a little bit magic when someone approaches your chart with an eye to explore and put into action the highest possibilities for yourself, pushing you into an evolved version of living.</p> 
             <p>I lay the groundwork by noticing what you are strongly identified with, that is also disallowing you from telling your story in any other way. This is the beauty of the evolutionary approach where the roots of your ‘old stories’ are exposed, left in the sun to decompose and then can serve to enrich the soil of your soul. In my work with clients I combine this approach with practical techniques, love and humour. My influences in the study of astrology are wide including modern psychological, traditional and Vedic. I am also a Pilates Practitioner and bring my ever evolving knowledge of health and the body to my astrological practice. I provide readings for self-discovery, children and parents, relationships, health, horary and personal forecasts.

She uses an evolutionary approach, seeing each chart as the symbol of what the universe needed to call into being at the time of birth. For individuals, the chart reveals the soul’s purpose in this lifetime, what it is called to heal, change, evolve, and contribute to human consciousness. The archetypal nature of each symbol of the chart—planet, sign, house, aspect—means there is no “good” or “bad”, and no “cause” or “effect.” Evolution, change, growth is not only possible—it is called for. The symbols in the chart are reflections of natural affinities, energies, and patterns of behavior. When we integrate them we get a picture of a very unique life, with propensities, opportunities for experience, and most of all—choices. Deciding what choice(s) to make is often what creates anxiety, pain and confusion. Our choices are also what bring us a feeling of empowerment, fulfillment and meaning. Optimal choices enable us to grow into the most of who we are meant to be—giving us that internal YES! feeling of congruence with our true nature. A reading of the chart can be extremely effective in clarifying optimal choices. A reading can reveal what is being called to evolve, and give guidance as to how obstacles to change may be removed, healed, or integrated.</p>

Evolutionary Astrology is that branch and philosophy of astrology that appeals as much to my rational mind as it does to my heart. I don’t believe that our future is written in stone or in the stars – I believe that each of us has inviolable free will. Every day, with every action and decision, we use our free will to shape the potential of our birth chart into our destiny. I have been fortunate to learn subtle and varied interpretations of the astrological elements through deep conversations and readings with friends and loved ones and through dedicated study with my teacher, Steven Forrest. Every chart I’ve analyzed and felt has helped me develop a more profound appreciation and compassion for our fate and freedom as human beings, flawed and challenged in our unique ways, but infinitely powerful and limitless at at the same time. I love using Evolutionary Astrology to spot and bring to light the seeds of greatness in each unique individual who gives me the gift of sharing their birth chart with me.</p>

Apart from conducting consultations in Australia and overseas Marc is the co principal and teacher at the popular Sydney Astrology School. Astrology is a way of helping you create a life that is purposeful, fulfilling and satisfying.” Since the 20th century many Astrologers have realized that Astrology was not about ‘good’ or ‘bad’ fortune and predestined outcomes, but about understanding an energy pattern that connects everything. The emphasis shifted from fate to gaining insights, and using those insights to make informed choices – choices that align with these energy patterns rather than struggling against them. In essence, Astrology is based on the fundamental concept that you were born for a reason, with specific purpose and with a goal of attaining a joyful life. It rests on the fact that each person has a unique astrological chart which can assist him or her successfully navigate through life. As a professional Astrologer, it’s my job to help you gain understanding and assist you in your quest to live to your true potential.

My goal is to help you discover <em>who you are meant to be</em>—rather than who you are in comparison to others. Patterns between the symbols and planets in your birth chart reveal a metaphorical story of karma that’s come to fruition in this life, ready to be dealt with should you <em>choose</em> to do so. As your karmic story unfolds ‘through the chart behind the chart,’ it reveals opportunity for you to understand why and how this is important to your evolutionary path and self-discovery.</p> 
             <p>Additionally, I’m a <em>Bach Flower Remedy</em> practitioner having received my training in the mid 1990’s from the Dr. Edward Bach Foundation based in England. I incorporate this globally acknowledged therapy with my astrological consultations <em>where appropriate depending on your goals and desires</em>. I hold a Master of Arts degree from DePaul University, Chicago where I focused on the integrative model of healing between western medicine, eastern traditions and the application of the Bach flower remedies as an adjunct therapy for eating disorders and other emotional illnesses. My books from Polair Publishing(London) include <a href="http://gayemack.com/printed-works/"><em>Igniting Soul Fire, Spiritual Dimensions of the Bach Flower Remedies</em></a>, <a href="http://gayemack.com/printed-works/"><em>The View- Mind Over Matter, Heart Over Mind-From Arthur Conan Doyle to Conversations with God</em></a> (<em>contributing author along with Neale Donald Walsh and Nobel Prize nominee Dr. Ervin Laszlo</em>) and <em>Making Complementary Therapies Work for You</em>; I’ve also authored several articles internationally on Edward Bach’s work and very much look forward to working with you.</p>

Yes<br> DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes<br> DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes<br> BRIEF STATEMENT: I’ve been studying astrology for the past ten years, and practicing since 2007. As of June 2012, I also have a Master’s degree in Psychology and Spirituality with a focus in Depth Psychology. My focus in school was on apocalyptic – or Plutonian – passages, and the ways astrology and ritual might be used to assist us through these passages at the individual and collective levels. I use astrology to help clients understand their path and purpose, as well as their challenges, setbacks, and constructive ways forward. I also use astrology as a starting point through which we can dive into the delicious worlds of dreams, the alchemy of relationship, and uncovering unconscious contents. I see astrology as an integral component of shadow work, which lets us all shine our lights a little brighter! I thrive off of the creative challenge of helping individuals to create rituals that compliment their soul’s path and empower transformation in a powerful yet playful manner. I believe that we are all on this earth right now to uncover as much truth as we ca – to feel and heal our grief and our pain, and to celebrate the mystery that is the human experience. Astrology provides a profoundly direct way of accessing this level of healing and transformation.</p>

             <p>BRIEF STATEMENT: I first became interested in astrology when I was 14 years old and picked up my first astrology book. I was very skeptical, but became a convert after casting my father’s chart and seeing how much it fit him. I studied astrology off and on over the years while focusing on a career in science. In 2000, I attended my first Steven Forrest Apprenticeship Program, and ever since have been intensively devoted to working with astrology while still pursuing my Ph.D. in science. After teaching extensively at the college level, and at the gym (I teach spinning, indoor rowing, and will soon be certified as a personal trainer with the National Academy of Sports Medicine) I realized that my true calling was to combine my love of coaching clients to improve their physical bodies with the emotional, mental, and spiritual facets of life using astrology. I call myself an “astrological coach” for clients who are interested to identifying practical ideas for improving their lives on every level.</p> 
             <p>Steven’s philosophy really aligns with how I view the world: everything that you do, the way you think, your attitude, and your path is a choice that you make. You can take the high road or the dark road. You can stretch yourself and choose a life of joy, or stay stuck in a path that you are comfortable with but may no longer be working for you. Like Steven, I strongly identify with the idea that our karmic past has placed us on this Earth, here to learn how to “get it right” in this lifetime. Your astrological chart is key to understanding your past and future options. I look forward to meeting and helping you!</p>

The key to our spiritual evolution is to align the two; Evolutionary Astrology provides direction for this goal. Christine believes Evolutionary Astrology provides a unique opportunity for self discovery through our natal chart. If we can explore inwardly and release the potential we hold within, our soul has an opportunity to live in harmony with ourselves and also the planet. We can utilise our strengths and identify our life challenges with more skills to propel us on a journey of personal self discovery and life fulfilment. This awareness also helps us both personally and in deepening our personal relationships.</p>

YES<br> BRIEF STATEMENT: Padma Life Coaching was born out of my desire to help others who are looking to reclaim their Joy in life. To begin the process we start with your Astrology Blueprint. Astrology is the oldest science practiced by our ancestors and it is the road map of your life – the blueprint – and is formed by the placement of the planets at the moment of your birth. Having an Astrology Blueprint gives you the key to unlocking your gifts, propensities, past life unhealed wounds that you brought into this incarnation along with the pot holes in every aspect of your life.</p> 
             <p>So many people just let Life happen to them, thinking that they have no control – I used to “believe” this. The truth is: we do play a large role in what happens to us. It is our individual responsibility to decide whether we want to be active participants or just let life happen… I invite you to begin the journey of discovering your deeper self with an Evolutionary Astrology reading with me.</p>

Yes<br> BRIEF STATEMENT: I try to make my readings entertaining. It doesn’t mean that I shy away from difficult subjects (now that just wouldn’t be interesting), only that in my opinion a good astrological reading, like a good TV show, is not just about conveying the meaning. It’s an experience! And because it’s so often true that the way we approach something in life is the way we approach most other things, I suspect that wanting one’s astrological reading to be entertaining may lead to a more interesting life in general.</p> 
             <p>My best and most faithful clients are curious, mercurial people who don’t necessarily believe in astrology. Typically we enjoy each other’s company a lot.&nbsp;Oh, and I have a solid training in clinical and social psychology and a huge respect for scientific method, so some of the entertainment I provide is based in actual psychological research.&nbsp;</p>

Phone and in-person sessions are recorded and CD is part of the package.<br> BRIEF STATEMENT: Shamanic Evolutionary Astrology is my specialty. From astrology to shamanic technique it is likely that we will locate an avenue you can move along effectively which suits the current moment. It was during 1969 that I became interested in astrological technique. Over the last few years I have facilitated the shamanic technique into my living focus. Since 2006 I have facilitated a weekly astrological group which meets in Port Townsend, Washington. On the third Wednesday of each month I offer to the public @ Pippa’s Real Tea in Port Townsend an astrological consideration for the upcoming month.</p> 
             <p>The story of your life which comes to light through and astrological discourse can be invigorating as well as challenging. During the process you will have to face yourself and perhaps some of the issues you have been avoiding. As well, there will be moments of enlightenment and a hopeful and hearty chuckle at some of the foibles you put yourself through. Depending on the direction and depth you wish to go in, the conversation that we may share will occupy a couple of hours. What we will open up I consider sacred space and is never shared specifically with others.</p>

YES<br> DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? YES<br> DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? YES<br> BRIEF STATEMENT: The focus of my practice is on assisting the client in healing of spirit, soul and body. I have been an acupuncturist since 1988. I began very seriously studying astrology during my own crisis and quest of deepening my understanding of the evolution of consciousness at the beginning of my first Saturn return in 1985. I began by learning to cast charts by hand from Noel Tyl’s series of books, <em>The Principles and Practice of Astrology</em>. I have since then voraciously incorporated astrological principles into my one-on-one healing practice. I personally found that astrology is the best self-learning tool available. It also became apparent that the study of astrological archetypes helped in my understanding of Chinese Medicine. This combined with the realization of the fundamental truth that we are first and foremost spiritual beings is what was paramount in helping me through my own crisis of being. What seems to me of the most value in modern astrology is the Evolutionary approach of Steven Forrest, Jeffrey Wolf Green and Mark Jones. In my life and my healing practice I combine this with the one thing that I have studied longer and that is the Spiritual Science of Rudolf Steiner. The astrology based on his spiritual work is known as Astrosophy. In my practice I combine the wisdom contained in these systems with the ancient healing arts of acupuncture and Jin Shin Jyutsu. This enables working with a client on all levels of being including the physical. It is a powerful method of helping to restore wholeness. This requires a one-on-one hands on approach, but does allow for great flexibility in treatment possibilities.</p>

Claudia is the official Italian translator of Steven Forrest European Programs. Steven Forrest has been her first and only teacher and she really is very familiar now in constructing a karmic point of view. Through her experience she discovered that knowing is not enough, the soul must feel, and the unconscious must be heard and recognized in order to use our tools efficiently. She works with vibrations of sound for many years now. Bearing in mind that vibrations creates matter and the reality we live in, and that we are the vibrational manifestation of the solar system at the time of our birth, she developped after years of studying and practice a planetary constellations to balance the vibrations within the human psyche and to release the soul from the karmic influence shown in the nodal story. Through the comprehension of our birth chart we really can understand our fears and difficulties. Fears are real, even if we do not remember where they come from. The soul just feels the eco of that experience which still vibrates in the psyche. Her aim is to change that vibration, bringing it on the surface first in order to transform fears into our greatest potential. She lives in Switzerland but works in Italy as well. Her courses not only offer theoretical information but also a vibrational experience of the manifestation of our personal birth chart. She speaks Italian, English and French.</p>

Yes<br> DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes<br> DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes<br> BRIEF STATMENT: I believe that Astrology in general can serve as an extremely effective tool for glimpsing a bit of Order in what often feels like a Chaotic Universe. I further believe that Evolutionary Astrology in particular can offer us a real chance at using Astrology so as to experience profound healing, growth, and empowerment in our lives.</p> 
             <p>I worked in the past as a California attorney and for nine years as a publicly-listed biotech corporation’s Chief Financial Officer…but I feel much more of a natural kinship with metaphysics and wellness than I do with the law or finance. I relocated to the Providence, RI area in late 2016 in order to more fully focus on my real interests, and I now offer both in-person consultations and sessions conducted at a distance via email and Skype.</p> 
             <p>Please take a look through my website, and contact me directly to set up an appointment. I value every opportunity I get to help a client transform that impenetrable-seeming buzz of symbols called a birth-chart into a wellspring of useful self-knowledge. I look forward to working with you!</p>

I also enjoy the challenge of reading couples’ charts.</p>

A cosmic reflection of the human presence. Thru the mind of man, the mind of the universe comes alive and the gift of astrology, the seeing of oneself becomes available. A language of symbols, astrology can be mysterious to many. I feel it’s important to demystify the language and within a sensitive, caring, and open environment help the client understand the depth, range and pure potential of choice these planetary symbols offer.</p> 
             <p>The birth chart is the map of the lifetime, the story of the person; laying out the terrain of the life, revealing people and experiences, challenges and opportunity. Very importantly the purpose and path for soul evolution. The planetary cycles or “astrological weather” are the ever moving planets creating relationship with planets in the birth chart, providing further opportunity for experience and growth. The level of self awareness gained through understanding the planetary symbols, combined with free will, creative and conscious intention, astrology can be an insightful and empowering tool to navigate your life; creating one that is rich with personal meaning, joy, and authenticity.</p> 
             <p>My love and study of astrology began about 25 years ago in my mother’s living room. There I found and began reading “Sun Signs” by Linda Goodman. Many books and classes followed. In the late 90’s I found a book by Steven Forrest. In reading his work, I knew I’d found my true astrology teacher. In May of 2005 I began studying with Steven in his Apprenticeship Program and continue to do so. I have been a professional astrologer since 2003. All readings, long distance or in person are recorded on CD’s. Within the Albuquerque, NM and surrounding areas I give readings in person. For further information, please visit my website.</p>

Astrology as a spiritual science affords us many gifts. If life is a journey, whether for this lifetime or multiple lifetimes, astrology is then a veritable roadmap or GPS, of and for the soul. The natal or birth chart is our soul’s blueprint, and cannot be overridden or changed, but karma that has ripened within it can be softened or negated. Astrology, therefore, is our compass on this journey. It guides us on the path of our souls’ evolution, and shows the lessons we need to learn.</p> 
             <p>American Express once had a slogan, “Don’t leave home without it.” Knowledge and wisdom of the soul’s journey is a tool I wouldn’t “leave home” without. Throughout our lifetime(s), we encounter forks in the road which require choices. Astrology provides understanding, lending to more conscious self-awareness, and hopefully, more conscious choices. It helps us to see ourselves and others as souls vs. mere personalities. We begin to have more compassion and less judgment for ourselves and those around us. Our personalities begin to “soften”. Your path IS your Path. Everything that has come before this moment has been for the purpose of your soul’s evolution. As your guide, my goal is first, to help you understand your Self, and second, to assist you in making choices that support your evolution. It is my Life purpose. It would be an honor and privilege to serve you. Diane has been a certified alcohol and drug counselor (CADC-II) since 1996. She is also a certified massage therapist and certified yoga teacher in the Kriya lineage. She uses multiple esoteric approaches in her healing work including flower essences and gem elixirs.</p>

I have been working with individuals, couples and groups since 1984. Your questions may be considered on many levels, from the spiritual or soul level overview (channeled by Spirit and detailed through the Evolutionary Astrological approach), the emotional or psychological components, through to the physical, practical details of life and choices. I am well trained in psychosynthesis, a spiritual psychology providing powerful inner processes if you’re interested in integrating or shifting places where you feel stuck. While Evolutionary Astrology suggests past life themes and the direction for healing and soul growth, sometimes the personal experience of a past life regression can add healing and depth to the process. You may choose to schedule an astrological reading or a blend of these various modalities. Appointments are by phone (normally I call you) or in person.

             <p><a id="EVELYN2" name="jwalters"></a><strong>JESSA WALTERS</strong> <br> ADDRESS: Minneapolis, Minnesota<br> PHONE:&nbsp;<a href="tel:%28612%29%20916-4784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(612) 916-4784</a>&nbsp;<br> EMAIL:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jessa@jessawalters.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jessa@jessawalters.com</a><br> WEBSITE:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jessawalters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.jessawalters.com</a><br> LEVEL: 2<br> DO YOU DO LOCAL IN-PERSON WORK? Yes&nbsp;<br> DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes (I provide a recording of the phone session)&nbsp;<br> DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes&nbsp;<br> BRIEF STATEMENT:&nbsp;<br> BRIEF STATEMENT: Jessa received her MA in Philosophy and Religion from the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco, CA in 2006. She went on from there to live and teach at a university in South Korea for three years. In Korea she began receiving readings from a Forrest-trained astrologer and started to study this school of astrology on her own. The astrological readings and study quickly became a catalyst for the shifting and expansion of her consciousness. Combined with traveling extensively throughout Asia and steeping herself in Buddhist practice and yoga, those three years abroad were an incredibly fruitful, transformative time. The tone was set for returning to her place of birth, Minnesota, in 2011 to begin a year-long yoga teacher training program in Minneapolis, diving evermore into the depths of personal yogic practice and learning to share it with the community. Jessa is now a well-established yoga teacher, as well as co-founder/producer of the annual Minneapolis Yoga Conference. She also takes women to Bali each year on retreat, where she weaves together&nbsp;yoga, meditation and dance, evolutionary astrology and dream work, ritual and sacred ceremony. In May 2014, Jessa began Steven Forrest’s Evolutionary Astrology Apprenticeship Program in Southern California, which felt like a longtime dream finally coming into form. She is now officially certified and offering readings.&nbsp;</p> 
             <p><em>“The process of diving deeply into a person’s chart is the most intimate, joyous, fulfilling work I could ever imagine. The transformation of awareness that occurs during a reading is profound and continually fills me with awe and gratitude for having come upon this study and practice in this lifetime.”</em>&nbsp;-Jessa</p>

It has provided incredible insight to myself, and my family in helping validate our lives – as we live it; understand our strengths and weaknesses, and comprehend more fully the work we are meant to do in this lifetime. The birth chart is the map of our lifetime, the story of the person; the terrain of the life, revealing people and experiences, challenges and opportunities – it is as unique as a set of fingerprints. An accurate chart interpretation is not so much a way of predicting what’s going to happen tomorrow, or next year, as it is a way of learning to evolve more consciously on our spiritual journey in this lifetime, and for each of us to contribute to the evolution of humanity in some infinitesimal way. I look forward to helping you interpret the roadmap of your journey.</p> 
             <p><strong>Chart Rectification:</strong> I am also available for chart rectification. I have very reasonable rates and if you know your birth time within a 3-hour window, I can usually do a rectification for as little as $100.</p>

Yes<br>DO YOU WORK BY TELEPHONE? Yes<br>DO YOU RECORD YOUR SESSIONS? Yes<br>BRIEF STATEMENT: In the summer of 2000, I left a twenty year career in the film industry to study Evolutionary Astrology. A series of major events created a crisis that resulted in a strong curiosity about astrology, and I was fortunate to be led to Evolutionary Astrology. As I began to study, it seemed I was experiencing a past memory of astrology. This was a very intense time. After ten years I can honestly say that Evolutionary Astrology has helped me in a monumental way. It is entirely compatible with my spiritual path and enhances my spiritual path. For me it’s not so much a way of predicting what’s going to happen tomorrow or next year as it is a way of learning to be comfortable with now. Steven’s incredible insight has been invaluable in helping me understand what it is that I am here to resolve and where my focus can be in terms of my soul evolution. Discovering this focus for clients is vital to me as a counselor. Tomorrow will come. Next year will come. Where will the focus be?</p>
