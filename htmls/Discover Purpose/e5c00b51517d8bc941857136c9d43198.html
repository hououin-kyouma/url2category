Meditating deeply on these questions, ancient sages discovered four major forces at play that profoundly shape our day-to-day lives and guide us on a path to meaningful fulfillment.<\/p><p> The <em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/soul-s-desire/\">Purusharthas<\/a><\/em>, referred to in Vedic texts and within the great epics of the Ramayana and Mahabharata, are translated in Sanskrit as the \"goals of human existence\" or \"the soul’s purpose.\" These universal aims influence every thought and deed of our lives. They are <em>artha<\/em>, <em>kama<\/em>, <em>dharma<\/em>, and <em>moksha<\/em>.<\/p><p><strong>Artha<\/strong> is material welfare and the pursuit of the means we need to survive and prosper within the complex political and economic forces of our times. <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/aim-high/\"><strong>Kama<\/strong><\/a> is desire, our experience of enjoyment, pleasure, beauty, sensual satisfaction, love, and delight. <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/importance-identifying-shraddha-dharma/\"><strong>Dharma<\/strong><\/a> is right action in accord with natural law (Rta), service to the greater good, and the discovery of our true purpose, why we are here. And,<strong> moksha<\/strong> is spiritual realization and freedom.<\/p><p> Traditionally, yoga is most widely understood as the pursuit of moksha. Perhaps a more integrated vision of the four Purusharthas, and closer to their original intent, is that for such a complete spiritual ripening to occur, we need to integrate and balance all four, the foremost of which is dharma.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/your-heart-s-desire/\">Spiritual Conflict: Does Desire Make You Spiritually Weak?<\/a><\/p><h3>Dharma<\/h3><h3>Why am I here?<\/h3><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p><em>Happiness is not attained through self-gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose. <\/em><br tml-linebreak=\"true\"><em>—Helen Keller<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote><p> An Indian tale recounts how a king asked his assistant to go on a long journey in order to acquire a document important to the kingdom’s survival. The young man set forth on his journey, excited about the prospect of seeing new places and meeting new people. After two years he returned, anxious to tell the king about his myriad experiences and to offer him all the rare things he found. The king patiently listened to his long story and when the young man was finally finished, asked him, \"And where is the document you were asked to retrieve?\" Stunned by the question, the assistant realized that he had entirely forgotten the purpose of his journey.<\/p><p> This parable illustrates that no matter how many experiences we might have, if we don’t follow and fulfill our life’s purpose, the journey will be empty no matter how seemingly full. There are many different meanings for dharma, but in this context, dharma refers to one’s life purpose. It is why we are here, the deeper lessons we’ve come to understand, and the gifts we’ve come to offer the world. In the <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/history-of-yoga/first-book-yoga/\">Bhagavad Gita<\/a>, Krishna counsels a doubting and confused Arjuna: \"It is better to do one’s own dharma, however imperfectly, than to do another’s, however perfectly.\" In Vedic times, one’s role in society was prescribed depending on one’s caste, whether it was to be laborer, warrior, merchant, or priest. In modern times, especially in the West, when such roles aren’t defined, following dharma challenges us to listen to and follow our inner compass and the wise counsel of trusted spiritual friends.<\/p><p> Our understanding and practice of dharma changes throughout life and involves a continuous commitment to self-discovery. Dharma encompasses not only our responsibilities to our families and society, but also the inner lessons we’ve come to learn and the qualities we are here to embody. It is our offering of self to the world that no other person can express in quite the same way.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/teach/finding-your-dharma-as-a-path-to-yogic-healing-part-1/\">Finding Your Dharma as a Path to Yogic Healing<\/a><\/p><h3>Artha<\/h3><h3>What do I need?<\/h3><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p><em>Dharma is well practiced by the good. Dharma, however, is always afflicted by two things, the desire for profit (artha) entertained by those that covet it, and the desire for pleasure (kama) cherished by those that are wedded to it. Whoever, without afflicting dharma by profit, or dharma by pleasure, follow all three—dharma, profit and pleasure—succeeds in obtaining great happiness.<\/em><br tml-linebreak=\"true\"><em>—The Mahabharata, Book 9.60<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote><p> In many religious traditions, material wealth and spiritual pursuits are opposed to each other; to pursue one, you must forsake the other. The image of a trident-bearing ascetic wearing a loincloth can be contrasted with that of a radiant queen living in a sumptuous palace. How do we reconcile these seemingly opposite expressions of artha? When we reflect on our own lives, we may find that at times we move more toward renunciation (of the material) and at other times toward worldly engagement.<\/p><p> The outer circumstances aren’t necessarily indicative of what’s really going on. An ascetic may have deep attachment to the respect he gets from others for his renunciation and the queen may be able to renounce in a heartbeat the luxurious display of her domain. What is unique about artha is that it supports and is in service to our true dharma, whatever that may be.<\/p><p> However, for us, living in a strong consumer society, we need to be aware of how easy it is to be overwhelmed by the pursuit of material gain and the constant chasing after comfort. How many square feet do we really need to shelter ourselves? How much food do we need to stay healthy and fulfilled? There are so many ways in which we can become hijacked into pursuing far more than our essential needs. Our lives can toil in the continuous cycle of getting and spending. When we become clear about our dharma, then we can more easily discern what we really need as material support.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/meditation/mind-mapping-meditation-identify-shraddha-dharma/\">Mind-Mapping Meditation to Identify Shraddha + Dharma<\/a><\/p><h3>Kama<\/h3><h3>What do I want?<\/h3><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p><em>Wherever Beauty peeped out, Love appeared beside it; wherever Beauty shone in a rosy cheek, Love lit his torch from that flame. <\/em><br tml-linebreak=\"true\"><em><em>―<\/em>Jami<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote><p> In Indian mythology, Kama is often depicted as the god of love holding a bow and arrow aimed to resuscitate the sunken hearts of those in despair and tempt the mighty. Kama’s arrows are flower-tipped and his bow is described as the mightiest in the universe, though it is made simply of a sugar cane reed and a string of buzzing bees. At Kama’s appearance, pregnant storm clouds emerge from the horizon, flowers unfold their petals, and lightning splits the sky. Intoxicating fragrances envelop the land, and humans perform the oldest of rituals, the dance of fertility.<\/p><p> All that is born originates from kama. Nothing from birth to death occurs without kama. It is the yearning that draws us to the threshold of the temple and the fierce love that helps the yogi transform destructive expressions of desire. Kama is powerful and double-edged: his love arrows can open a closed heart or wreak havoc on even the most disciplined and accomplished of ascetics.<\/p><p> Kama can also be the cause of so much suffering. Desire in its unrefined aspect can be an insatiable hunger. When it is suffused with our dharma it is the natural experience, without too much clinging and attachment, of pleasure, love, and the sweet beauty of the world and the bounty of our relationships. Kama is healing in that it revitalizes our senses, softens the hardened focus of the mind, and brings a loving twinkle to our eye. It is the source of our creativity and the fullness of love that naturally desires to help all those who come into our lives.<\/p><h3>Moksha<\/h3><h3>Who am I?<\/h3><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p><em>The heart of the universe with every throb hurls the flood of happiness into every artery, vein and veinlet, so that the whole system is inundated with tides of joy. The plenty of the poorest place is too great: the harvest cannot be gathered. Every sound ends in music. The edge of every surface is tinged with prismatic rays.<\/em><br tml-linebreak=\"true\"><em>—Ralph Waldo Emerson<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote><p> Moksha is the full awakening to our real nature and the liberation from suffering. In the tradition of Patanjali and early Buddhism, moksha is a final yogic attainment expressed as the release from ignorance and an extrication from this world. In the tantric tradition, moksha is being free in the midst of the cacophony of the world, a continuing revelation and opening to the never-ending depths of wisdom and love. At its root, moksha is the universal desire for healing, well-being, spiritual understanding, and the experience of our true nature. It is the hidden knowing, the sudden whisper we may hear when things have gone most wrong in our lives or when we are truly receptive, reminding us of our unbounded divine heritage.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/meditation/stoke-your-spirit-achieving-true-meditation/\">Stoke Your Spirit: Achieve True Meditation<\/a><\/p><h3>Balancing the Four Purusharthas<\/h3><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p><em>The technique of a world-changing yoga has to be as uniform, sinuous, patient, all-including as the world itself.

             <p> The journey of yoga begins with a whispered question that lives within the silent depths of our hearts, a longing to know who we are and why we are here. Meditating deeply on these questions, ancient sages discovered four major forces at play that profoundly shape our day-to-day lives and guide us on a path to meaningful fulfillment.</p>

             <p> Traditionally, yoga is most widely understood as the pursuit of moksha. Perhaps a more integrated vision of the four Purusharthas, and closer to their original intent, is that for such a complete spiritual ripening to occur, we need to integrate and balance all four, the foremost of which is dharma.</p>

             <p> An Indian tale recounts how a king asked his assistant to go on a long journey in order to acquire a document important to the kingdom’s survival. The young man set forth on his journey, excited about the prospect of seeing new places and meeting new people. After two years he returned, anxious to tell the king about his myriad experiences and to offer him all the rare things he found. The king patiently listened to his long story and when the young man was finally finished, asked him, "And where is the document you were asked to retrieve?" Stunned by the question, the assistant realized that he had entirely forgotten the purpose of his journey.</p>

             <p> This parable illustrates that no matter how many experiences we might have, if we don’t follow and fulfill our life’s purpose, the journey will be empty no matter how seemingly full. There are many different meanings for dharma, but in this context, dharma refers to one’s life purpose. It is why we are here, the deeper lessons we’ve come to understand, and the gifts we’ve come to offer the world. In the <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/article/history-of-yoga/first-book-yoga/">Bhagavad Gita</a>, Krishna counsels a doubting and confused Arjuna: "It is better to do one’s own dharma, however imperfectly, than to do another’s, however perfectly." In Vedic times, one’s role in society was prescribed depending on one’s caste, whether it was to be laborer, warrior, merchant, or priest. In modern times, especially in the West, when such roles aren’t defined, following dharma challenges us to listen to and follow our inner compass and the wise counsel of trusted spiritual friends.</p>
             <p> Our understanding and practice of dharma changes throughout life and involves a continuous commitment to self-discovery. Dharma encompasses not only our responsibilities to our families and society, but also the inner lessons we’ve come to learn and the qualities we are here to embody. It is our offering of self to the world that no other person can express in quite the same way.</p>

             <p> In many religious traditions, material wealth and spiritual pursuits are opposed to each other; to pursue one, you must forsake the other. The image of a trident-bearing ascetic wearing a loincloth can be contrasted with that of a radiant queen living in a sumptuous palace. How do we reconcile these seemingly opposite expressions of artha? When we reflect on our own lives, we may find that at times we move more toward renunciation (of the material) and at other times toward worldly engagement.</p>
             <p> The outer circumstances aren’t necessarily indicative of what’s really going on. An ascetic may have deep attachment to the respect he gets from others for his renunciation and the queen may be able to renounce in a heartbeat the luxurious display of her domain. What is unique about artha is that it supports and is in service to our true dharma, whatever that may be.</p>

There are so many ways in which we can become hijacked into pursuing far more than our essential needs. Our lives can toil in the continuous cycle of getting and spending.

             </blockquote>
             <p> In Indian mythology, Kama is often depicted as the god of love holding a bow and arrow aimed to resuscitate the sunken hearts of those in despair and tempt the mighty. Kama’s arrows are flower-tipped and his bow is described as the mightiest in the universe, though it is made simply of a sugar cane reed and a string of buzzing bees. At Kama’s appearance, pregnant storm clouds emerge from the horizon, flowers unfold their petals, and lightning splits the sky. Intoxicating fragrances envelop the land, and humans perform the oldest of rituals, the dance of fertility.</p>
             <p> All that is born originates from kama. Nothing from birth to death occurs without kama. It is the yearning that draws us to the threshold of the temple and the fierce love that helps the yogi transform destructive expressions of desire. Kama is powerful and double-edged: his love arrows can open a closed heart or wreak havoc on even the most disciplined and accomplished of ascetics.</p>
             <p> Kama can also be the cause of so much suffering. Desire in its unrefined aspect can be an insatiable hunger. When it is suffused with our dharma it is the natural experience, without too much clinging and attachment, of pleasure, love, and the sweet beauty of the world and the bounty of our relationships. Kama is healing in that it revitalizes our senses, softens the hardened focus of the mind, and brings a loving twinkle to our eye. It is the source of our creativity and the fullness of love that naturally desires to help all those who come into our lives.</p>

             <p> Moksha is the full awakening to our real nature and the liberation from suffering. In the tradition of Patanjali and early Buddhism, moksha is a final yogic attainment expressed as the release from ignorance and an extrication from this world. In the tantric tradition, moksha is being free in the midst of the cacophony of the world, a continuing revelation and opening to the never-ending depths of wisdom and love. At its root, moksha is the universal desire for healing, well-being, spiritual understanding, and the experience of our true nature. It is the hidden knowing, the sudden whisper we may hear when things have gone most wrong in our lives or when we are truly receptive, reminding us of our unbounded divine heritage.</p>

At the time he heard it, Jon was a journalist whose favorite form of humor was cynical irony, and he had an ingrained distrust of words like <em>joy<\/em> and <em>bliss<\/em>. If you had asked him, \"Have you ever been happy?\" he would have called to mind a few great high school basketball games and maybe a rave he'd gone to, tripping on ecstasy, in 1993. Then he probably would have shrugged the question off, saying something edgy, like, \"Only idiots are happy.\"<\/p><p> But one day, in the yoga class he'd signed up for because his doctor told him it would be good for stress, the teacher described a posture by saying that it brought forth the innate bliss in the heart. \"Innate bliss?\" Jon thought. \"Not in <em>my<\/em> heart.\" Then the teacher started to read from the writings of an Indian guru: \"What we are looking for in everything is joy, ecstasy. But ecstasy is within you. Look for it in your own heart.\"<\/p><p> Since he was stuck in the posture with little else to do, Jon decided to bring his reporter's investigative skills to bear on the idea. He turned his attention around, with the intention to look inside and see if what the teacher had said had any possible basis in reality. He aimed his attention into the place where he thought his heart was and even tried to visualize the pumping muscle in his chest.<\/p><p> To Jon's surprise, something shifted. He felt a little current, a trickle of good feeling. The feeling then expanded into radiating warmth. Suddenly, he was ecstatic. And even more interesting, he knew exactly what ecstasy was, even though he'd never experienced it before (not counting the drug-induced kind). It turns out that joy is something that even the most hardened pessimist can recognize when he sees it.<\/p><h3>The Joyful Truth<\/h3><p> There are certain core teachings that can forever shift the way you see the world. \"Joy is within you\" is one of them. Even if you hear it in purely psychophysical terms, if you really <em>hear<\/em> it, it's going to help you recognize one of the most empowering truths there is: It is actually possible to feel happy regardless of how the world is treating you, or how horrible your childhood was, or the fact that all of your friends are more successful than you are. You can even, this teaching implies, be happy when you're failing at something or when you're sick.<\/p><p> But as with all the great truths, your understanding of what \"Joy is inside you\" means is crucial. If you don't understand<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> it deeply, you're likely to mistake superficial good feeling for joy. You might also attach your joy to the circumstances that triggered it, like that evening of chanting with Krishna Das, or the weekends when you get to hang out with a particular teacher, or romantic moments with your partner, or even time spent jogging or playing basketball. Then you become addicted to those particular actions, people, or situations. Or you might make the mistake I made for years and become a sort of bliss fascist, expecting yourself to be in a \"good\" state all the time and subtly beating yourself up when you aren't.<\/p><p> So, what are we really talking about when we discuss inner joy, and how are we supposed to approach it? In Sanskrit, there are basically four words for happiness—<em>sukha<\/em>, <em>santosha<\/em>, <em>mudita<\/em>, and <em>ananda<\/em>—each of which points to a different level of happiness. Together, they constitute a path that leads us to the kind of happiness that really cannot be shaken.<\/p><h3><em>Sukha<\/em> (Fleeting Pleasure)<\/h3><p> The word for ordinary happiness—the kind of happiness that comes from pleasant experiences—is <em>sukha<\/em>. It means \"ease,\"\"enjoyment,\" or \"comfort\" and is often translated into English simply as \"pleasure.\" Sukha is the happiness we feel when we're firmly inside our comfort zone. I live on the California coast, and there are days when I wake up in the morning and look out the window and feel, well, spontaneously happy. That particular form of happiness is less likely to be present when I'm, say, circling the San Jose airport trying to find a way into the long-term parking zone so I can make my flight. The point, as every inner tradition will tell you, is that sukha, joy experienced as pleasure, is basically unreliable. Any state that depends on things going our way can disappear in an eye blink.<\/p><p> There's a famous story by the writer Katherine Mansfield that perfectly describes this quality of ordinary happiness. A young wife is giving a party. As she surveys the scene she has created, she congratulates herself, because everything seems perfect—her house, the wine, the mix of guests, her nice husband pouring drinks for everyone. She realizes she is completely happy. Then she notices her husband whispering in the ear of a female guest and realizes he is setting up an assignation with the woman. Suddenly, the wife's happiness is transformed into the agony of loss.<\/p><p> The story is, of course, a profound yogic parable, an illustration of why the yogic texts make such a point of warning us about the fleeting quality of ordinary happiness. Ordinary happiness—sukha—is inseparably linked with its opposite: <em>duhkha<\/em>, or \"suffering.\" This pain-pleasure dichotomy is one of the basic <em>dvandvas<\/em>, the pairs of opposites that plague our lives as long as we live out of duality consciousness, the feeling of being separate from others and the world. Like hot and cold, birth and death, and praise and blame, sukha and duhkha inevitably follow each other, simply because when our well-being depends on external conditions, it will always come and go. This is one of the problems the Buddha noticed, the one that led him to formulate the first noble truth.<\/p><h3><em>Santosha<\/em> (Contentment)<\/h3><p> The simple yogic antidote to this problem—the endless chase after the mirage of permanent pleasure—is to go to the next level and begin to cultivate santosha, which the yogic texts translate as \"contentment.\" The <a href=\"/wisdom/462\">Yoga Sutra<\/a> considers practicing santosha essential, because it is the fastest way to still the agitation that comes from frustration, discomfort, and unsatisfied desire.<\/p><p> Implicit in santosha is the idea of being OK with what you have, accepting what you are, without feeling that you need anything extra to make you happy. Hard-core yoga texts like Vyasa's commentary on the Yoga Sutra actually associate santosha with the spirit of renunciation—the absence of desire for anything other than what we need. In this viewpoint, we can achieve real contentment only when we are willing to give up striving for what is out of reach, to stop expecting more of life than it can give us, and to let go of the mental patterns that destroy our satisfaction—like comparing our skills, character, possessions, and inner attainments with those of the people around us.<\/p><p> I recently heard from a friend who was laid off work six months ago and has yet to find another job. Practicing santosha is a big part of his strategy for salvaging his inner state. One way he does this is by reminding himself to accept things as they are. \"I make the calls,\" he told me. \"I send the e-mails. I make the contacts. Then I turn my attention inside, and I remind myself that the universe will always give me what I need. Once I've done that, then my mind can be calm about it. Sometimes I sit and breathe in 'Trust' and breathe out 'Trust.'\"<\/p><h3><em>Mudita<\/em> (Spiritual Happiness)<\/h3><p> Practicing santosha calms the mind, and when we calm the mind, there's a good chance that the next level of happiness—mudita—will begin to sneak through. In English, the closest translation of mudita is \"spiritual happiness.\" Mudita in its purest form is the joy that Jon experienced—the kind that comes from out of nowhere, like a message from our deeper self, and that actually has the power to change our state in an instant. It gives rise to a whole host of feelings, such as gratitude, exaltation, equanimity, and the capacity to see beauty even in things we don't ordinarily find beautiful, like sidewalk litter or fast-food hamburgers.<\/p><p> Mudita can be cultivated, and much of spiritual practice is aimed at generating this kind of joyfulness. In one yoga studio I know, the attendance at the weekly chanting sessions is higher than at any other program. Why? Because chanting generates mudita. So do certain yoga poses and <a href=\"/practice/meditation/\">meditation<\/a> practices, like mantra repetition and focusing on enlightened beings. The devotional traditions, like <a href=\"/practice/2661\">bhakti yoga<\/a> and Sufism, specialize in the art of cultivating mudita, which can become a powerful bridge into even subtler states of awareness.<\/p><h3><em>Ananda<\/em> (The Bliss That Passeth Understanding)<\/h3><p> When mudita deepens until it becomes our entire field of experience, we find ourselves in touch with the most profound level of joy: ananda. <em>Ananda<\/em> is usually translated as \"bliss,\" but in my opinion, the English word <em>bliss<\/em> is much too lightweight to convey what ananda really is. Ananda is ecstasy, rapture, a joy that wells up on its own from the very depths of the universe and connects us instantly to the vastness of pure being. Ananda, in other words, is divine power in the form of happiness. When you touch it, you know it—and you also know that you've touched the deepest level of reality.<\/p><p> According to the great nondualist philosophers of the Upanishads and the Shaiva and Shakta Tantras, ananda is actually God. My teacher used to say that when you feel ecstasy surging through your veins, you are experiencing God. You can find this same association of joy with divine experience in Sufi poetry, in the Kabbalah, and running like a rich vein through the writings of Christian mystics. C.S. Lewis called his spiritual autobiography <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Surprised-Joy-Shape-Early-Life/dp/0156870118/\">Surprised by Joy,<\/a> because all of his experiences of God's presence were experiences of absolute happiness. That's why cultivating joy is such a direct path to inner experience: It is not only a means, it is the goal itself.<\/p><p> To me, this insight is the real clue, the secret of how to follow the path of joy. Begin by taking what these great teachers say seriously. Try out their understanding that joy is actually present, inherent in you and in the world around you. Then look for the practices and attitudes that can help you open yourself up to it. Joy can arrive on your doorstep spontaneously. But it can also be approached step-by-step, through a combination of practice and self-inquiry.<\/p><h3>Making a Practice of Joy<\/h3><p> That's basically what Jon has learned to do. His initial state of unbidden joy didn't last—such states rarely do. A few days later, he found himself back in his normal state of mild depression and anxiety leavened with flashes of humor, and soon the experience of joy was more a memory than a reality. But Jon couldn't forget the experience, and he wasn't willing to dismiss it as a fluke. So little by little, he carved out a path for himself. He read Sufi poetry. He started a meditation practice. But the real shift he made was to choose to believe that his experience of joy came from a deeper level of reality than the difficulties, pain, and general dysfunction he saw in his own mind, on tv, and in the streets of his city.<\/p><p> Jon developed a self-inquiry process that went something like this: \"OK, I'm choosing to believe that I've got joy inside. But I don't feel it right now. So what can I do about that? What part of my attitude do I need to change? What practice can I do that might help trigger that joy?\"<\/p><p> He discovered, as most of us do in time, that it doesn't always work to approach joy frontally, demandingly. The Siddha guru <a href=\"http://www.siddhayoga.org/gurumayi-chidvilasananda/\">Gurumayi Chidvilasananda<\/a> once compared joy to a butterfly that will come and sit on your hand but that you can never grasp or hold. Instead of trying to \"get\" joy, we do better when we find practices and attitudes that attract it. Most of the clues we get from our teachers about how to work with the mind are actually practices for attracting joy. Lovingkindness practice, remembering to be grateful to ourselves and others for every little boon and even for difficulties, consciously letting go of grudges—all of these help displace the sludge that builds up around the heart and keeps joy away. Even more important is the practice of noticing the stories you tell yourself, monitoring your thoughts when they create painful inner states, and using the creative power of your own mind to create inner states that are conducive to joy.<\/p><p> So, taking it step-by-step, the process of cultivating joy could look something like this. It begins with the simple understanding that joy is real, and then continues with the decision to tune your mind and heart so they are open enough to feel it. Depending on your state, you might need to practice some form of santosha, which for me means noticing the thoughts and feelings, the anxieties or desires, that are currently agitating my body and mind, and then doing what I can to let go of whatever resistance to my current reality is causing the agitation.<\/p><h3>Cutting to the Chase<\/h3><p> The next step is some form of mudita practice—chanting, prayer, going directly into the heart center and letting the energy there expand, meditating with a loving image or visualization, offering prayers for the well-being of others, remembering a beloved teacher, or any of countless other practices.<\/p><p> In the Tantric texts, one core practice—I call it a cut-to-the-chase practice—lies at the heart of all of the above. It's very simple, it can be done anytime—while you're in the car, washing the dishes, or even reading this magazine—and it will shift your consciousness in a very short time.<\/p><p> Close your eyes and remember a time when you felt really happy. Then take yourself into that moment. See if you can get a feeling-sense of yourself in the situation. Perhaps you'll do this visually—by remembering where you were, what you wore, who was present. Perhaps you'll do it by invoking the feeling, asking yourself, \"What did that happiness feel like?\" and then waiting until the feeling-sense begins to make itself present in your body. Stick with it until you actually <em>feel<\/em> the happiness—even if only a little.<\/p><p> Then remove the memory of the scene or situation and just feel the feeling. Find the place in your body where the feeling is centered, then let it expand until it fills you. If you're very visual, it might help if you give the feeling a color—a warm one, like gold or pink. Or you might work with the breath, breathing into the feeling and letting it expand on the exhalation.<\/p><p> Sit with this feeling of happiness. See if you can hold it.

In order to experience and sustain this purpose, you must first establish a sense of what drives you, of who you are in the world. <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/history-of-yoga/first-book-yoga/\">The Bhagavad Gita<\/a> says that a person is what their <em>shraddha<\/em> is. The closest word the English language has to express the concept of shraddha is “faith.” However, shraddha is not as much a spiritual-based faith as a faith in oneself.<\/p><p><em>See also <\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/lifestyle/litmus-test-integrity-5-questions-ask/\">Sally Kempton’s 5 Question Integrity Test<\/a><\/p><h2>What Is Your&nbsp;Shraddha?<\/h2><p> You will know what your shraddha is because you feel it.

Your shraddha is what defines you as being you. One could say that your shraddha is reflected through your virtues and values, it is what defines your sense of Self, your character. Your character, or your nature, determines your destiny. It shapes how you perceive, live in, and are motivated in the world. When these values are dismissed or violated you may react very strongly.<\/p><p> These moments offer yogis the opportunity to practice <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/meditation/5-mindfulness-meditations-master-emotions-face-stress/\">mindfulness<\/a>, or try to create space between the stimulus and the reaction. There is much to be learned by observing and noting the actions, behaviors, people, and places that create these opportunities. These are your triggers, and they are indicators on the map that reveals your shraddha. What you strive for the most reflects what you value the most.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/yoga-off-the-mat-spirituality/deepak-chopras-4-step-mindful-practice-enrich-life/\">Deepak Chopra’s 4-Step Mindful Practice to Enrich Your Life<\/a><\/p><h2>What Is&nbsp;Your Dharma?<\/h2><p> When your deepest values are revealed, they illuminate your <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/teach/finding-your-dharma-as-a-path-to-yogic-healing-part-1/\">dharma<\/a>. Dharma represents your inherent purpose in life and it is directly related to your shraddha. The direct translation of the word dharma is “that which supports.” Your purpose supports your faith. This purpose is not necessarily where you derive your financial livelihood, but it is present in your life in some way. The more time you spend living your dharma the more satisfied and at home you feel within your Self.<\/p><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><h3>Let the beauty of what you love be what you do. —Rumi<\/h3><\/blockquote><p> Cultivating the wisdom to trust in your nature is developed through living in alignment with your truth.

And although she shares a lot of good times with him—dancing, cooking, and entertaining—Rosemary is clear that she doesn't depend on Robert to feel good about herself. Like many other people, she has already learned that lesson the hard way, through failed relationships.<\/p><p> \"Often, two people get together and hope the other will fulfill them,\" says Anna Douglas, a vipassana meditation teacher and one of the founding teachers of Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre, California. \"Often, a relationship can be a misguided search for our own completeness.\"<\/p><p> Most of us have been there—attracted to someone who strokes our deflated ego, lavishes extravagant gifts on our scraping—by existence, takes us to the parties we would not otherwise be invited to, or somehow seems to fill a hole we don't think we can fill on our own. \"At first they appear magical,\" says Douglas. \"Later you realize they have their wounded places and needs and unfinished business they're hoping you'll complete for them.\" And regardless of how much you have in common or how much love you share, a relationship can crumble under the weight of expectations that it will make both of you feel whole.<\/p><p> If you're on the hunt for a soul mate, your best move may be to take a break from searching online dating sites and instead commit yourself to your practice. It is possible to set the foundation for a great relationship—even when there's no prospective partner on the horizon—by examining your beliefs and habits and seeking the real truth about what will make you happy. In the end, as Rosemary discovered, finding a soul mate has less to do with meeting potential candidates than with feeling complete and whole in yourself.<\/p><h3>Practice Perspective<\/h3><p> Several years before she met Robert, Rosemary was engaged to Jay (not his real name), a charming and wealthy headhunter who had been her high school sweetheart. \"Here was a man who had everything and wanted me desperately. He was so affirming, loving, and devoted, it was like a drug,\" Rosemary says of their six-month long-distance romance.<\/p><p> She was struggling to make it as an actress in New York and living far from friends and family. \"He was living in San Francisco, where I wanted to settle,\" she says. \"He offered everything: a home, a car, a ring, living near my family and friends again.\" So she donned the ring, packed her bags, and moved west. But almost immediately, she began doubting him and the engagement. Some part of her recognized that her \"love\" for him was based on something more like desperation than a profound sense of connection. Less than a week after arriving at his home in San Francisco, she moved out and began the soul searching that helped her see the truth of who she was, which eventually prepared her to find her life's true love.<\/p><p> She was in her fifth year of practicing yoga, and taking a teacher training with Ashtanga teacher David Swenson, when she came to grips with leaving her fiancé. \"Back-bending<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> would crack my heart open, so I could grieve and actually feel what was happening and let it out. And Handstand helped me to heal. Partly it was the change in perspective. But it was also the ferocity of holding a posture past the comfort zone,\" she recalls. \"I was physically strengthening myself and emotionally burning through the weakness and sadness.\"<\/p><p> For the next year, Rosemary devoted herself to a deeply introspective Mysore-style Ashtanga Yoga practice. (In this form of yoga, students follow a prescribed sequence of poses at their own pace, without a teacher leading them.) \"I was very aware of my thoughts. I saw my desire to have my fiancé back—the validation and love and lifestyle. Then, little by little, the more I practiced, the more I realized that my desire for him was not going to be truly fulfilling,\" she says. \"My yoga training stripped my illusions away.\"<\/p><p> Bo Forbes, a yoga teacher, Integrative Yoga Therapist, and clinical psychologist in Boston, says Rosemary's experience is not uncommon; a committed <a href=\"/practice/\">yoga practice<\/a> can absolutely transform our relationships. \"Through our <a href=\"/practice/\">yoga practice<\/a>, we learn to look at ourselves, including the parts of us that are less evolved. Learning how to do this physically, with discomfort in an asana, helps us to do this emotionally,\" she says. \"If we can't sit with our emotions, we are more likely to act them out on ourselves or others.\"<\/p><p> If we can figure out how to solve our own problems and to love ourselves, we're not so needy. And that's when we can enjoy a great relationship for what it is, rather than because our partner appears to fill some need we think we have.<\/p><h3>Pattern Recognition<\/h3><p> Our culture and traditions school us to believe the opposite: that someday our prince (or princess) will come, that a relationship has the potential to solve problems like loneliness, that the right partner will make us feel whole. Popular romantic movies propagate the myth of another person completing us.<\/p><p> On the face of it, the idea of being \"completed\" by another seems deeply romantic. But it's a fantasy that can weigh down a relationship with impossible expectations. The truth is that while your partner can offer many things, he or she can't \"complete\" you. The only person who can give you a sense of security and an unshakable love of you is you. And though you may \"know\" this with your mind, sometimes feelings of unworthiness, insecurity, and incompleteness are so deeply buried that you aren't even aware of them or of how they influence your behavior.<\/p><p> Rosemary eventually realized that the unresolved pain of her parents' separation had fueled a stream of difficult relationships, including her engagement. \"I was so hungry for partnership and love,\" she says, \"that I would reason my way into staying in relationships that didn't work.\"<\/p><p> The root of Rosemary's unsatisfying relationships might be explained by the yogic concept of samskara—a pattern deeply ingrained in our subconscious that causes us to act out variations on the same theme again and again. \"Sam means 'complete or joined together,' and kara means 'action, cause, or doing,' so samskaras are the individual actions, ideas, or thoughts. Together, they constitute our patterns,\" explains Forbes. You can also think of a samskara in psychodynamic terms, as an unconscious groove that gets laid down early in your life and continues to be played again and again.<\/p><p> In relationships, these grooves keep you choosing partners for the same, often misguided, reasons. Maybe you look for somebody just like you (a mirror); maybe you choose partners who have some quality you wish you had (someone who is outgoing if you're shy, or someone with a big, happy family if yours suffered through a messy divorce); or maybe you unconsciously try to recreate or correct the dynamics of your parents' relationship.<\/p><p> \"The definition of one of these patterns is that you're not aware of it when you're in it,\" says psychotherapist Mark Epstein, author of Open to Desire: The Truth About What the Buddha Taught. \"Usually you don't recognize it until it's ruined some part of your life.\"<\/p><h3>Feel and Heal<\/h3><p> Such was the case for Simon (not his real name), 47, who repeatedly hooked up with depressed, angry, and unstable women who treated him badly. \"These women did not wear a sign on their foreheads saying, 'I'm a mess,' but my radar would just pick up on that,\" he says.<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> He sought counseling and realized he was continually pushing his feelings aside to take care of his partners, who tended to require a lot of emotional energy. He was drawn to people with \"more obvious and bigger baggage than my own, like actual clinical disorders,\" he says. \"So the focus ended up being on their problems, and I didn't have to look at my own.\"<\/p><p> Doing yoga and working with his therapist, Simon gradually learned to pay attention to his feelings. That changed his behavior. Last summer, for example, he pinched a nerve playing softball and was laid up in bed. His then-girlfriend raged at him for ruining her summer. In the past, Simon might have accepted this treatment. But his new awareness enabled him to feel his anger and hurt—and to express himself. His gut told him to end the relationship. Now that he's aware of his own emotional and behavioral patterns, he's able to keep himself from falling back into his habitual behavior. He finds that he no longer gravitates to women who mistreat him. He's not in a serious relationship now, but he knows that when a connection clicks, he'll be ready.<\/p><h3>Completing...Yourself<\/h3><p> Jenni Noetzli, 32, spent her 20s chasing creative, unstable musicians. She had a degree in biochemistry and was interested in becoming a doctor or lab researcher, even as she succumbed to intense infatuations with \"emotionally unreachable\" guys—many of whom were into drugs and lived the rock 'n' roll lifestyle.<\/p><p> Forbes says: \"If we come into a relationship from a place of lacking contentment, we end up looking for someone to fill us up to make those feelings go away.\" It's important to try to address our missing pieces on our own.<\/p><p> Jenni did. She took a break from dating and got serious about her yoga practice. After a while, she realized she had been squelching her own creative impulses, which kept manifesting in the guise of attraction to wild artists. Doing some soul-searching, she decided her true passion was not conventional medicine but acupuncture. She pursued it as a career and now practices in Minneapolis. Lo and behold: As soon as she began to find creative fulfillment in her own work, she stopped lusting after musicians. She is happily married to a fellow acupuncturist, and yoga is part of her daily life. \"I no longer feel my partner is an extension of my creativity,\" she says. Jenni and her soul mate are distinct individuals, complete on their own, who respect and admire each other.<\/p><p> If we examine our romantic desires and suspect that they take the form of unhealthy longing for completion, we need to create our ideal life so we aren't looking for someone else to do it for us. Nourishing the unsatisfied parts of ourselves, as Jenni did, is the key to becoming whole. Epstein, the psychotherapist, says that a regular meditation practice or therapy can help identify the patterns you're stuck in. \"If you expose the samskara to awareness, there's a natural healing,\" he says.<\/p><p> The reason meditation is so effective at rooting out these patterns, says Spirit Rock's Douglas, is that when you have no distractions, you can't avoid noticing your suffering. \"Meditation brings to the surface what's not working in your life,\" she says. And when you stay with the sensations of suffering, you begin to see what's causing the suffering—bringing awareness to your thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors. Like asana, meditation can also help you stop reacting to situations out of habit and can pull you out of a bad rut. \"Before doing something you might regret, you learn to pause and reflect,\" Douglas says.<\/p><h3>Slow Down<\/h3><p> To begin searching your soul, you don't need to retreat to a monastery. You can simply start a practice in which you commit to having compassion for yourself and to learning to sit with and observe your feelings. \"With many feelings, the impulse to turn it into a behavior is so strong that you're already in the action before you've even reflected on the feeling,\" Epstein says. \"By deliberately not acting it out, you're forced to be with the feeling.\"<\/p><p> Taking things slowly can be helpful, too. Stephen Cope, author of The Wisdom of Yoga: A Seeker's Guide to Extraordinary Living, suggests being mindful after getting involved with someone new. \"With relationships, when we're unclear, a very good practice is to slow things down,\" he says. Take time to reflect before accepting a date, or get to know someone as a friend before letting romance develop. A time-out allows us to better see the true nature of our desire for another, adds Cope.<\/p><p> Once you've found wholeness within, you'll see many more possible soul mates. Spirit Rock teacher Douglas says: \"I once told my therapist, complaining about my boyfriend, 'I don't think he's the right one.' She said one of the most helpful things a therapist has ever told me: 'Of course not. There is no right one.'\"<\/p><p> In fact, you may just want to ditch the idea of a soul mate altogether. The very term \"suggests there is another half who is going to complete you,\" says Douglas. \"But on coming into spiritual maturity, the thing that is most important to you is to be free and to love others, not to be looking for love.\"<\/p><p> When you feel content without a soul mate, that's when you may find it easiest to meet one. That's what happened to Rosemary. Nine months after splitting up with her fiancé, she wasn't looking for a new boyfriend. She just wanted to have a good time with her friends and joined them at a dance party one night. It happened that one of them knew Robert.<\/p><p> As he approached Rosemary's group, she was struck by the way he looked at her: \"We were in a crowd of people at a huge club, and he was looking directly at me. I thought, 'If I start dancing with this man, there's no end to it.'\"<\/p><p> Rosemary decided to go for it. \"The rest of the room dissolved. We didn't look at anyone else, and we danced together for two or three hours.\" Rosemary tore herself away only because she had a morning yoga class to teach. \"When you let go of the desire for someone to complete you,\" she says, \"only then can you be truly open to what's right for you.\"<\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci0207568d10392620","ci0207568dd00725bd"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci0207568dd00725bd","primaryImageId":"ci02075693501925bd","path":"/yoga-101/soul-mate","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci0207568d10392620"},{"$ref":"ci0207568dd00725bd"},{"$ref":"ci0207568d801a2620"}],"socialPopularity":0,"slug":"soul-mate","contentNodeId":"cn02075699600a2620","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2017-04-03T20:13:08Z","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-04-03T20:13:08Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci02075695405425bd","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","isNoindex":false,"title":"Helena Echlin","slug":"helena-echlin","disqusId":"f3785ba2-18a9-11e7-9076-0280f27e34ed","path":"/author/helena-echlin","migrationId":"ContentUserProfile:helena-echlin"},"teaser":"Sometimes you have to find yourself in order to find your soul mate.","promoTitle":"Soul Mate","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"facebook":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0}},"dek":"Sometimes you have to find yourself in order to find your soul mate.","migrationId":"ContentArticle:63946soul-mate","ownerId":null,"metaTitle":"Soul Mate"},{"authorProfileId":"ci0207568d702d25bd","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2007-08-28T23:59:45Z","sectionIds":[["ci0207568d10392620","ci0207568dd00725bd"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"metaDescription":"","id":"ci02075698c0012620","geoCoordinates":{},"objectType":"ContentArticle","isNoindex":false,"title":"Intro to Yoga Philosophy: Study Your Supreme Soul","editedTimestamp":"2017-04-05T18:31:23Z","disqusId":"156cc3c8-18aa-11e7-9076-0280f27e34ed","autoSaved":false,"tmlEmbeds":[],"sectionsLeafNode":["ci0207568dd00725bd"],"bodyTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>In the last issue we began a three-part series on <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/yoga-101/intro-yoga-philosophy-tap-heat/\">Kriya Yoga<\/a> from <a href=\"/wisdom/2208\">Patanjali<\/a>'s Yoga Sutra, starting with <em>tapas<\/em> (self-discipline). Now we'll address <em>svadhyaya<\/em> (self-study). Remember that while Kriya Yoga contains three distinct actions—tapas, svadhyaya, and <em>Ishvara pranidhana<\/em> (devotion)—they are not hierarchical. Each action contains the other two: Self-discipline, for example, not only prepares us for self-study but is also a means for self-study.<\/p><p><em>Svadhyaya<\/em> literally means \"to recite, repeat, or rehearse to oneself.\" The question is: Recite or repeat or rehearse what? According to Vyasa, a fifth-century commentator on the Yoga Sutra, svadhyaya involves the \"repetition of a sacred Mantra, the sacred syllable Om, or study of scriptures relating to Moksha, or freedom from bondage.\"<\/p><p> Svadhyaya thus has two aspects. The first is the recitation of mantras. Patanjali placed particular emphasis on the seed-mantra Om, which is the symbol of the higher Self or Lord. By reciting this sound, we can \"tune in to\" its source and, as Vyasa says, reveal the supreme soul.<\/p><p> The second aspect of svadhyaya is the study of sacred scriptures. Which ones? Patanjali was surely thinking of his own compilation of verses in the Yoga Sutra, but maybe also books like the Bhagavad Gita or the Vedas. The goal here wasn't to pile up intellectual lumber, but to use the material as a mirror for intense self-study. Nowadays we have access to many books and schools of thought, both Eastern and Western, ancient and modern, so our possibilities for this second aspect of svadhyaya are endless.<\/p><h3>Sound it Out<\/h3><p> You might think that the best way to recite a mantra is as loudly as possible, so all the deities in the universe will hear you. But the most effective way to recite is as quietly as possible.<\/p><p> Try this at the start of your next Pranayama or <a href=\"/practice/meditation/\">meditation<\/a> session: Inhale, and then, as you exhale, whisper a long, slow Om. Repeat for 10 to 15 breaths, feeling the sound reverberate in your skull and spread through your body.<\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci0207568d10392620","ci0207568dd00725bd"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci0207568dd00725bd","path":"/yoga-101/intro-yoga-philosophy-study-supreme-soul","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci0207568dd00725bd"},{"$ref":"ci0207568d10392620"}],"socialPopularity":1,"slug":"intro-yoga-philosophy-study-supreme-soul","contentNodeId":"cn02075698c0012620","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2017-04-03T20:11:03Z","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-04-03T20:11:03Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci0207568d702d25bd","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","isNoindex":false,"title":"Richard Rosen","slug":"richard-rosen","disqusId":"a9884f09-18a9-11e7-88b6-025a1927d20b","path":"/author/richard-rosen","migrationId":"ContentUserProfile:richard-rosen"},"teaser":"","promoTitle":"Intro to Yoga Philosophy: Study Your Supreme Soul","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":7.34809e-15,"velocity":8.5721e-8,"estimate":0.48904844498702005,"lastCount":1},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"facebook":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0}},"dek":"","migrationId":"dd3e54494ee9134edb15d4946f80246fba1d498d","ownerId":null,"metaTitle":"Intro to Yoga Philosophy: Study Your Supreme Soul"},{"authorProfileId":"ci0207568e301525bd","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2012-11-26T17:14:04Z","sectionIds":[["ci0207568d10392620","ci0207568dd00725bd"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"metaDescription":"According to the Vedas, your soul has four distinct desires, collectively described as purushartha, \"for the purpose of the soul.\"","id":"ci020756af20022620","geoCoordinates":{},"objectType":"ContentArticle","terms":[{"isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-04-03T20:11:30Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci0207568f200d25bd","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"rod stryker","vocabularyId":"cs0201e562c00025a6:terms","editedTimestamp":"2017-04-03T20:11:31Z","disqusId":"b931332c-18a9-11e7-88b7-025a1927d20b","path":"/tag/rod-stryker","slug":"rod-stryker","displayName":"rod stryker","migrationId":"Term:post_tag:terms:rod-stryker"}],"isNoindex":false,"title":"Use Intention to Harness Your Mind","primaryImage":{"altText":"3 women on beach in warrior two","height":450,"cloudinaryVersionId":1491250431,"defaultCaption":"","id":"ci0207569800292620","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"3 women on beach in warrior two","primaryPhotoId":"ci0207569800292620","hasFaces":true,"width":800,"publicId":"MTQ2MTgwNzE5NzI0MTQ0MTYw","format":"jpg","bytes":314964,"migrationId":"ContentPhoto:66918"},"editedTimestamp":"2017-04-05T18:31:13Z","disqusId":"ead25b04-18aa-11e7-88b9-025a1927d20b","autoSaved":false,"tmlEmbeds":[{"$ref":"ci0207569800292620"}],"sectionsLeafNode":["ci0207568dd00725bd"],"bodyTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><div tml-image=\"ci0207569800292620\"><\/div><h3>Uncover your personal blueprint for happiness and let it guide you to bliss.<\/h3><p> Happiness. We all seek it. There is no more basic or universal drive than the desire to <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/2565\">be happy<\/a>. It is inherent, something we are compelled to want by virtue of who and what we are. Everything that human beings have accomplished and aspired to, our every endeavor, has been and always will be rooted in the impulse to satisfy our longing for happiness. We desire love, pleasure, beauty, friendship, accomplishment, wisdom, and power. Each of us longs for an abiding sense of purpose and meaning, peace, health, and security. At some level, we also aspire to freedom, to a greater capacity to shape our destiny, and to a connection with something greater than ourselves, which some call Source, Self, or God.<\/p><p> As the 13th-century poet Rumi observed: \"The wings of humankind is its aspiration.\" Aspiration was responsible for the creation of language, society, culture, science, architecture, the world's spiritual traditions, and even walking on the moon. Everything that humanity has accomplished is the legacy of its enduring desire for fulfillment.<\/p><p> The yoga tradition provides one of humankind's most effective systems for achieving happiness in every aspect of life. In the same way that the physical practice of yoga so effectively benefits your body and mind, the larger science of yoga is similarly powerful in unlocking the vast potential of your body, mind, and spirit to help you achieve your best life imaginable. Yoga's supreme objective is to awaken an exalted state of spiritual realization, yet the tradition also recognizes that this state does not exist in isolation from the world and worldly matters. Thus, the science of yoga teaches you how to live and how to shape your life with a commanding sense of purpose, capacity, and meaning. In short, yoga has less to do with what you can do with your body or with the ability to still your mind than it has to do with the happiness that unfolds from realizing your full potential. There may be no more important step to achieving ultimate fulfillment than accepting what the Vedas teach us about desires—that some desires are inspired by your soul.<\/p><h3>The Four Desires<\/h3><p> According to the Vedas, your soul has four distinct desires, which are collectively described in the tradition as <em>purushartha<\/em>, \"for the purpose of the soul.\" The first of these four desires is <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/for_teachers/1032\"><em>dharma<\/em><\/a>, the desire to become who you were meant to be. It is the longing to thrive and, in the process, to fulfill your unique purpose; it is the drive to fulfill your destiny. The second is <em>artha<\/em>, the desire for the means (such as money, security, health) to help you fulfill your dharma. The third desire is <em>kama<\/em>, the longing for pleasure in any and all forms. The fourth is <em>moksha<\/em>, the desire for spiritual realization and ultimate freedom; it is the intrinsic desire to be free from the burdens of the world, even as you participate fully in it, and to experience a state beyond the reach of the other three desires.<\/p><p> According to the Vedic tradition, the four desires are inherent aspects of your soul, or essence. Your soul uses them to fulfill its unique potential. Learning to honor the four desires allows you to thrive at every level and leads you to a complete and balanced life. It's important to understand that, from the viewpoint of the Vedas, all four kinds of desires, including desires for material prosperity, if pursued mindfully, can be spiritual because they can pave the way for your soul to express itself on Earth. Of course, not all desires lead to happiness. Desires can and do result in pain and frustration. However, according to the ancient tradition, attachment to desire, not desire itself, is the underlying cause of practically all of our pain and suffering.<\/p><p> The tradition also speaks at great length about the necessity of understanding your life's deeper purpose, because true happiness is dependent on your fulfilling it. Indeed, it is my observation that the failure to develop a clear understanding of their life's purpose is the reason many people are unable to achieve and sustain the happiness that they, deep in their hearts, seek. The challenge we all face is to learn how to take into account the full measure of who we are and use the positive force of all four of our soul's desires to lead us to our best life.<\/p><h3>The Power of Intention<\/h3><p> The place to start harnessing your power to determine your destiny, to achieve any intention as well as lasting fulfillment, is your own mind. According to the Vedic tradition, the most profound way to affect the course of your life is by harnessing the power of resolution or intention, which in Sanskrit is called <em>sankalpa<\/em>.<\/p><p> Sankalpa is the compound of two Sanskrit words: <em>kalpa<\/em>, which means \"a way of proceeding\" or, more revealingly, \"the rule to be observed above or before any other rule,\" and <em>san<\/em>, which refers to a concept or idea formed in the heart. Thus, sankalpa means determination or will: an intention, a conviction, a vow, or most commonly, a resolution—one that reflects your highest aspirations. In practical terms, a sankalpa is a declarative statement, resolution, or intention in which you vow or commit (to yourself, your teacher, a priest, or even God) to fulfill a specific goal.<\/p><p> The ancient concept of sankalpa is predicated on the principle that your mind has a measureless capacity to affect the quality and the content of your life. The ancient traditions—including Veda, <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/2240\">Tantra<\/a>, and yoga—venerated the mind and appealed to the Divine for the mind to be filled with \"auspicious thoughts,\" because they saw the mind as the chief architect of our lives. In other words, they viewed your mind as the ruler of your fate. \"The mind is everything. What you think, you become,\" said the Buddha.<\/p><p> We are all familiar with the concept of intention or resolution. It is said that the average American makes 1.8 resolutions per year. We create intentions to lose weight, find a more rewarding career, get organized, or attract the ideal partner. We resolve to change our diet, be more disciplined, work harder, work less hard, spend more time in nature or with our families, enrich our spiritual life, stop smoking, be a greater force for good in the world, or do any one of countless other things we aspire to accomplish. However, it's critical to note that research shows that at least 80 percent of us do not achieve our resolutions. Despite all that you may have heard or read in praise of the limitless power of intention, this statistic means that fewer than one in five of us achieve what we set out to achieve.<\/p><p> What explains this failure to fulfill our resolutions? One very important reason is that we too often focus on fulfilling our desires without giving much thought to how our desires serve the greater meaning and purpose of our lives. Another reason, from the perspective of the Tantric tradition, is that there is a science to manifesting intention, and if you don't apply it, you will likely end up as part of the 80 percent who don't see their resolutions fulfilled.<\/p><p> A sankalpa, by definition, focuses your mental and energetic resources and, in the process, the forces of nature, toward a specific end. I've worked with people who have successfully applied sankalpa to achieve everything from healing a life-threatening illness to enriching their spiritual life or finding their dream job.<\/p><p> Now comes the critical question: How do you identify the specific desire that would best serve actualizing your potential? More specifically, what—if you could achieve it in the next 6 to 18 months—would enrich you and, in the process, contribute to fulfilling the meaning and purpose of your life? At first glance, the answer might seem obvious. If you're financially strapped, wouldn't you just create a sankalpa to make more money at your current job, find a better-paying one, or win the lottery—in other words, a sankalpa that focuses on achieving a desire in the realm of artha (finances and material security)? Not necessarily. When it comes to desires, the obvious answer isn't always the right one. That's because until you learn to do otherwise, the obvious answer almost always comes from your intellect, and your intellect isn't completely capable of knowing which intention will best serve you. Your soul, however, has a way of always knowing what you need to serve your higher purpose and, at the same time, what your next best step should be in order to experience the lasting happiness you seek. The point is, we all know, more or less, what we want; we don't always know what we need.<\/p><h3>Choosing Your Right Desire<\/h3><p> One of my students, Victoria, was in her mid-50s when she was told she would never again walk without the aid of a cane or crutches. A few days earlier, she had been hit by a car, which broke her hip and several ribs, and crushed the bones in one of her legs.<\/p><p> Victoria had, in the past, worked with the process of The Four Desires and fulfilled several sankalpas, including successfully creating and navigating a challenging career transition. Her intention now was to use her power of resolve to help herself heal. Unwilling to accept the doctor's prognosis, she assumed, quite logically, that her sankalpa should focus on artha—which entails health and well-being. Her goal was to learn to walk comfortably again, resume playing golf, and even dance. In combination with her sankalpa, I suggested to Victoria that she use <a href=\"/health/1372/\">Yoga Nidra<\/a>, an extraordinary deep-relaxation technique that empowers sankalpa.<\/p><p> A month or so later, Victoria and I spoke. The work she was doing was not having the effect on her body that she had hoped for. I was tempted to ask her to be patient but stopped short when she acknowledged something that her relaxation practice had revealed: Being completely dependent on those around her had forced her to see something that until then she had been unwilling to admit, which was that her boyfriend of 14 years had long been distant and unsupportive; now that she really needed him, he was more distant and less nurturing than ever.<\/p><p> Despite being \"together\" with him, Victoria had felt alone for a long time. She realized that she needed to heal her relationship with relationship. She recognized that she needed to focus her attention on the fulfillment of kama, the second desire, which relates to love, intimacy, and relationship. The more we spoke, the more obvious it seemed that Victoria's first step to healing was less about her body and more about her heart.<\/p><p> If she was going to walk again, she had to be strong enough to \"walk away\" from a less-than-nurturing relationship. I helped her craft a new sankalpa. Her resolve would no longer be \"I am completely healed from physical injuries.\" Her new resolve became \"I feel loved. I stand, walk, and dance happily on my own, surrounded only by people who care for me.\"<\/p><p> From the moment she refocused her sankalpa and began to methodically apply it, Victoria's physical healing accelerated. Almost instantly, she felt different. She was now inspired and uplifted; most important, she was now prepared to face the physical challenge of learning to walk again and stand completely on her own. Less than two years later, Victoria not only stands without a cane but walks, plays golf, and practices and teaches yoga. Her former boyfriend is no longer part of her life. Victoria's story shows that when you collect your resolve, commit all of your resources, and direct them properly, you can create lasting and meaningful change.<\/p><h3>Seek Within<\/h3><p> So how do you know when you've chosen the correct focus for your sankalpa? Consider Matthew 6:33 from the Christian New Testament: \"Enter the kingdom of Heaven and righteousness and all things shall be added on to thee.\" The Vedic scriptural source, Chandogya Upanishad, conveys the exact same principle this way: \"His desires are right desires, and his desires are fulfilled.\" The terms \"righteousness\" and \"right desires\" point us back to the fact that the right desires are in line with our higher purpose. The Sanskrit term for such desires is satyakamna, which means \"true desire.\" The will to act on such desires is called satyasankalpa, or \"true resolve.\" How do you find your satyakamna, your true desire? The answer is to ask your soul. Steeped in soul, you no longer have to try to distinguish \"thy\" will from \"my\" will; soul is where universal will and individual desire merge. As Lord Krishna states in the Bhagavad Gita, \"I am desire itself, if that desire is in harmony with the purpose of life.\"<\/p><p> If you have little or no <a href=\"/practice/meditation/\">meditation<\/a> experience, you might assume that the soul is accessible only to those few who have dedicated their lives to finding and experiencing it. The good news is that this is not the case. One of the greatest yogic texts, the Yoga Vasishtha, puts it this way: \"This Self is neither far nor near; it is not inaccessible nor is it in distant places: It is what in oneself appears to be the experience of bliss and is therefore realized in oneself.\" In other words, anytime you experience profound happiness or bliss in your life, you are actually experiencing your soul. You may not know it, but the joy you are feeling is coming from you. It is you. The key is to learn to be able to access it whenever you want. This is where the practice of meditation comes in.<\/p><p> It's possible for anyone, in a single meditation session, to get at least a glimpse of stillness—and of a unique kind of contentment, the contentment that is your soul's nature. This is a critical point in achieving both spiritual and material fulfillment since, according to Vedic wisdom, we are each born with a blueprint to achieve a full and contented life. Your soul holds that blueprint, and the higher aspects of your mind—specifically, your intuition—are the means by which you can read that blueprint and let it guide you to fulfill its master plan.<\/p><p> Thus, by learning to apply the simple steps of meditation that I will lead you through (see the sidebar, \"Inquire Within,\" on page 109) and by learning to \"see\" those desires that are inspired by your soul, your desires can become the means by which your short-term goals, in any of the four categories of desire, become your way of manifesting your soul's overriding purpose, or dharma.<\/p><h3>The Path to a Fulfilled Life<\/h3><p> \"If you cling to a certain thought with dynamic willpower, it finally assumes a tangible outward form,\" said <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/slideshow/sneak-preview-awake-life-yogananda/\">Paramahansa Yogananda<\/a>. \"When you are able to employ your will always for constructive purposes, you become the controller of your destiny.\" The vows you hold dear, when you are deeply committed to them, speak directly to the universe, compelling it to act on your behalf. When such conviction is linked to dharma, the aspiration to become the best you can be, you will be led to a life of joyous fulfillment and accomplishment. Strengthened and focused by your sankalpa, or resolution, you will eventually learn to see how all things, all experiences—even those that are challenging or might at first appear to be obstacles in the path to achieving your desires—are actually helping to guide you.<\/p><p> In the process, you'll develop faith. As you become more capable and powerful in the service of a higher ideal, your resolutions will help you become a more powerful force for good in the world and enable you to realize the ultimate promise of yoga, which the Srimad Bhagavatam, one of India's most revered texts, describes this way: \"A human being is born to dive deep into the stream of life, find the hidden treasure, and attain eternal fulfillment.\"<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> Eternal fulfillment is both an art and a science. When you learn to skillfully apply the science, you become an artist. Your heart's deepest desires become your brush strokes, and the life you were meant to share with the world becomes your finished canvas.<\/p><h3>Inquire Within<\/h3><p><em>This meditation will help you listen to your soul as it points you in the direction of your true desires:<\/em><\/p><p><strong>Close Your Eyes.<\/strong> Become aware of your body. Bring your attention to your breath. Become aware of your effortless breathing for one to two minutes, until you feel still.<\/p><p> Now, bring your attention to your forehead in the space between your eyebrows. As you hold your attention there, become aware of your body breathing. Relax. Don't force or try to shape your breath.<\/p><p> Allow your awareness to connect your breath to the point between your eyebrows. When you notice the body breathing in, your awareness moves from the point between your eyebrows to the midbrain, a point roughly between your temples that is sometimes called the third eye. When you notice your body breathing out, sense your awareness moving from that point back to the point between your eyebrows. Continue to feel your awareness move from one point to another on the movement of your breath. As you breathe in, awareness moves from the point between the eyebrows to the midbrain. As you breathe out, awareness moves from the midbrain to the point between the eyebrows.<\/p><p> As your mind settles, feel the practice becoming more effortless; feel a growing sense of calm.<\/p><p> When you experience this, become aware of presence slowly unfolding in the midbrain. Continue to watch, feel, and listen.<\/p><p> Once you enter into a rhythm of deep peace and effortlessness, begin to sense that your awareness, at the point between your eyebrows, moves in and out on its own, independent of the breath. Eventually, stop thinking about the breath and just be aware of a kind of effortless pulse moving in and out of the third-eye center. Gradually feel a sense of bliss unfolding, your whole being flooded with a boundless sense of contentment and joy. Don't try. Just be aware and, at the same time, completely relaxed. Contentment will continue to unfold the more completely you let yourself go into effortlessness.<\/p><p> Now, become aware that the source of this contentment and joy you are experiencing is actually you. Continue letting go until you feel that you are the source of joy and bliss. In the final stage of this practice, you are completely absorbed into a state of joy and bliss, such that you no longer experience being separate from the universe of which you are a part. Eventually, you experience being bliss itself—unbounded, you are the bliss that the ancient teachings tell us is the nature of all things.<\/p><p> Now, established in this state, tune in to your \"wisdom center\"—the place of knowingness within you. For many people, it's in the gut. For others, it may be in the heartor third-eye center. The important thing is to just settle and tune in to a feeling of knowingness and certainty within you. Resting in a deep state of contentment, experience the part of you that knows exactly what you need and what you don't need. Feel connected to the inner core of truth that is always ready and fully capable of guiding you to your best life.<\/p><p> Continue to rest in contentment as you pose the following question to your higher Self. Calmly ask: \"Which one of the four desires, if it were to be fulfilled in the next 6 to 18 months, would best serve my highest purpose, or dharma?\"<\/p><p> Allow your inner voice to provide you with an answer that pinpoints the particular desire that will best serve your highest purpose. Don't let your rational mind take over this process; it must be organic and intuitive. The response from your soul will be decisive and clear.<\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci0207568d10392620","ci0207568dd00725bd"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci0207568dd00725bd","primaryImageId":"ci0207569800292620","path":"/yoga-101/soul-s-desire","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci0207568f200d25bd"},{"$ref":"ci0207568dd00725bd"},{"$ref":"ci0207568d10392620"}],"socialPopularity":9,"slug":"soul-s-desire","contentNodeId":"cn020756af20022620","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2017-04-03T20:11:15Z","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-04-03T20:11:15Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci0207568e301525bd","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","isNoindex":false,"title":"Rod Stryker","slug":"rod-stryker","disqusId":"b01cd27b-18a9-11e7-88b6-025a1927d20b","path":"/author/rod-stryker","migrationId":"ContentUserProfile:rod-stryker"},"teaser":"According to the Vedas, your soul has four distinct desires, collectively described as purushartha, \"for the purpose of the soul.\"","promoTitle":"Use Intention to Harness Your Mind","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":8.52778e-15,"velocity":9.2346e-8,"estimate":0.8226453175289237,"lastCount":1},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"facebook":{"acceleration":6.79367e-14,"velocity":7.37745e-7,"estimate":7.587546709700462,"lastCount":8},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0}},"dek":"According to the Vedas, your soul has four distinct desires, collectively described as purushartha, \"for the purpose of the soul.\"","migrationId":"ContentArticle:1141soul-s-desire","ownerId":null,"metaTitle":"Use Intention to Harness Your Mind + Fulfill Desires | Yoga Philosophy"},{"authorProfileId":"ci0207568d002e2620","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-01-11T22:26:31Z","sectionIds":[["ci0207568d104f2620","ci0207568d90322620","ci0207568e801225bd"],["ci0207568d10392620","ci0207568dd00725bd"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"metaDescription":"Discover the Enneagram, a personality assessment that can help you see what’s keeping you from realizing your most authentic, highest self.","id":"ci020756a1503b2620","geoCoordinates":{},"objectType":"ContentArticle","isNoindex":false,"title":"Who Am I?

But in the real world, ingrained patterns and personality traits can get in the way. Enter the Enneagram, a personality assessment that can help you see what’s keeping you from realizing your most authentic, highest self. Here’s how to use it, along with your yoga practice, to change course.<\/h3><p><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/people/people/coral-brown/\">Coral Brown<\/a>, a yoga teacher and licensed mental-health counselor in Rhode Island, uses the word “co-dependent” to describe her previous romantic <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/lifestyle/balance/relationships/\">relationship<\/a>, which lasted more than a decade. But at the time, she didn’t realize she was in such a pattern of over-giving that she was losing herself. While her <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/poses/yoga-sequences/\">yoga practice<\/a> helped shine a light on this tendency, Brown says studying the Enneagram—a four-decade-old personality-assessment system—also revealed that it was time to move on from the relationship. “The Enneagram enabled me to really see my core patterns,” says Brown, “ultimately helping me meet my needs in a healthier, more conscious way than ever before.”<\/p><p> The name Enneagram stems from the Greek words ennea, a prefix for “nine,” and gramma, meaning “to draw.” The system’s icon is a nine-pointed star, each point representing a distinct personality type. Most Enneagram experts agree we are all born with one dominant personality type (or number), which largely determines how we learn to adapt to our environment and the people in it. The Enneagram surfaced in the United States in the 1970s, riding the tails of the human-potential movement (think therapy, encounter groups, and primal scream). Since then, therapists, spiritual teachers, coaches, and even businesses have used the Enneagram as a tool to stoke authenticity, expose core motivations, and ultimately reduce interpersonal conflict. How can a simple personality test do all this?<\/p><p> “There’s resistance to change within all of us, and the Enneagram describes what that resistance is about for each of us,” says Peter O’Hanrahan, a leading international Enneagram teacher and trainer. “As a result, this system gives you very clear information about what you need to work on.” To wit, when Brown learned more about her Enneagram number—a Two—she was better able to see her core pattern of giving to others to feel good about herself, and that realization gave her a choice: do something about her blind spots, or ignore them. She chose to act. “I left my partner, and I found more of my own identity in my <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/teach/\">yoga teaching<\/a>,” says Brown. “I was more aligned with my truer purpose and nature.”<\/p><p> Susan Piver, author of the meditation primer <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Start-Here-Now-Open-Hearted-Meditation/dp/1511365420\"><em>Start Here Now<\/em><\/a> and a <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/meditation/\">meditation<\/a> teacher who leads retreats on the Enneagram, says the kind of alignment Brown experienced is what yoga is about at its core. “The Enneagram will tell us what we cannot see about ourselves—our ways of being that stem from our most wounded selves, which create confusion as a result,” says Piver. And if you’re willing to look at these wounds, which are almost always rooted in unexamined pain, you can start to chart a new, more authentic course forward, she says. “At a certain point—especially if you’re on a spiritual path—you have to do this,” Piver says. Read on to find out how.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/chakras-yoga-for-beginners/quiz-chakras-out-of-balance/\">Quiz: Which of Your Chakras Is Out of Balance?<\/a><\/p><h3>Self-Inquiry: Who Am I?<\/h3><p> The work of the Enneagram begins with figuring out your number, which essentially represents how you present yourself to others, where your attention goes when you quiet down, and what triggers your behaviors. Piver, for example, is a Four, which means her chief issue is envy. “Before I knew I was a Four, I used to think that what I longed for would make me happy,” she says. “Now, I’m able to see the longing itself as a sign that I’m unsettled, unhappy, or hurt, and that I can turn my attention within instead of looking for something outside. This helps me notice when I need to take better care of myself.”<\/p><p> In addition to revealing negative patterns and deep wounds, the Enneagram also highlights your greatest strengths. For example, when Piver’s envy is brought into balance, it becomes the more evolved version of itself: equanimity. “Envy and equanimity are on a continuum,” she says. And these continuums exist for all of the numbers, which means that regularly trying to find balance between your strengths and blind spots is the key to living a more aligned, authentic life.<\/p><p> Even better, all of this self-reflection comes with improved communication with other people. That’s why Piver calls the Enneagram an <em>upaya<\/em>, <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/yoga-101/sanskrit/\">Sanskrit<\/a> for “skillful means.” While she cautions against using the system to label someone, she says it can be a helpful tool to navigate communication blocks. For example: “My partner is a One, and Ones are focused on right and wrong,” says Piver. “I’m a Four, and Fours are focused on meaning. If we get into an argument, I want to talk and understand, but I can’t do that with him until I acknowledge what went wrong—that I see where the misstep happened. That is very useful to him because everything in him wants to get to the bottom of the right and wrong in order to fix it.” Once Piver’s partner’s needs have been addressed, they can then have the kind of conversation that also works for her.<\/p><p> Ultimately, the Enneagram can help us release the tight hold we have on our version of things. “It’s hard to understand a person’s makeup when you are only looking at it through your own lens,” says Piver. “But what if you were told, ‘Here are nine lenses—which one do you think this person is looking through?’ It gives you a way to let go of expectations so that a more genuine exchange can transpire. It generates compassion.”<\/p><p><em>See also <\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/ayurveda/whats-dosha/\">Quiz: What’s Your Dosha?<\/a><\/p><h3>Put the Enneagram Into Practice<\/h3><p> Yoga offers the perfect training ground to explore the nuances of your Enneagram type. When you know your number, you can start to use the Enneagram to let wash away what <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/who-was-patanjali/\">Patanjali<\/a> called the “layers and imperfections concealing truth.” “It’s an incredible companion [to yoga] that covers territory yoga doesn’t address,” says Michael Cohen, founder of the <a href=\"http://mikecohenkirtan.com/kirtan-training/\">Kirtan Leader Institute<\/a> and a certified Enneagram practitioner. “Yoga talks in broad terms about how to transcend our limitations; the Enneagram gives incredible detail about what that means.” For example, each number has a corresponding somatic pattern. “For Fives, Sixes, and Sevens, poses that bring energy to the lower body and the feet are very important because these types tend to leave their bodies by going up into their heads,” says O’Hanrahan. Once you know your type’s patterns, he says, you can customize your yoga practice to support the work you’re doing to escape your old grooves (or <em>samskaras<\/em>, in Sanskrit) and form new ones that serve you better.<\/p><p> To that end, Brown has paired a pose with each Enneagram number to accentuate both the challenges and the possibilities for that number. Determine your type, then use your pose and <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/slideshow/13-major-mantras-memorize/\">mantra<\/a> to continue your self-inquiry so that how you do asana reflects how you do you—with awakened clarity and compassion.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/whats-your-yoga-style-types-of-yoga-quiz/\">What’s Your Yoga Style?

It was a last-straw moment to beat any others, and I was either going to freak out—yell at the dogs, curse my husband for being unavailable, and stomp around the house wondering why all these things had to happen at once—or find a way to draw on the tools <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/who-was-patanjali/\">Patanjali<\/a> provides in the <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/yoga-101/philosophy/yoga-sutras/\">Yoga Sutra<\/a> to accept the situation with as much grace as I could and figure out how to get through it with as little suffering as possible. So, I opted for the latter, managed to laugh a little, put the dogs outside, and cleaned up the mess. This, I realized in that moment, is why I do yoga.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/the-power-of-atha/\">Yoga Sutra 1.1: The Power of Now<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"><\/a><br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> One of the greatest things I’ve learned from my teacher, <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/lifestyle/meet-the-innovators-t-k-v-desikachar/\">T. K. V. Desikachar<\/a>, is that the true value of yoga is found when you apply it to your daily life—especially in those messy moments (say, when your dog decides to have at a dirty diaper). <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/yoga-101/beginning-journey/\">The Yoga Sutra of Patanjali<\/a>, widely regarded as the authoritative text on yoga, is not just for contemplating on the mat. The sutras are meant to be put to the test and practiced in your work, leisure time, and in your role as a parent, partner, and friend.<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci0207568d304b2620\" tml-image-caption=\"\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><h2>The Yoga Sutra, explained<\/h2><p> This ancient yogic text is traditionally presented as a guide for refining the mind so one can reach the highest states of concentration and focus. This focus is a means to an end: It leads to a clearer perception and the ability to know the Self, which ultimately results in independence from suffering. The 195 short verses are believed to have been compiled sometime around 350 CE by Patanjali, whom traditionalists also credit with writing texts on <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/health/ayurveda/\">Ayurvedic medicine<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/yoga-101/sanskrit/\">Sanskrit grammar<\/a>. Very little is known about the man Patanjali. In fact, it’s unclear whether Patanjali was an individual or simply a name created to represent several people. Yet while factual details about Patanjali are scant, the Yoga Sutra and its lessons are still with us today.<\/p><p> The 195 sutras are divided into four books, or padas, which cover four broad topics: what yoga is (<em>samadhi pada<\/em>); how to attain a state of yoga (<em>sadhana pada<\/em>); the benefits of yoga practice (<em>vibhuti pada<\/em>); and the freedom from suffering (<em>kaivalya pada<\/em>) that is the eventual goal or result of a consistent practice. The word sutra comes from the same root as “suture,” or thread—each concept is compact and discrete, but it can be woven together with others to present a full tapestry of meaning.<\/p><p> Though composed of few words, each verse is rich with meaning and depth, so that the most <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/advanced/\">advanced student<\/a> can continue to gain new insights even after years of study. Every carefully chosen word has clear meanings and connotations, which is why the sutras are best learned from an acarya, or “one who travels the path”— an experienced teacher who can help you appreciate the layers of complexity in the text and apply their meaning to your life.<\/p><p> While Patanjali is concerned primarily with calming, focusing, and refining the mind, the ultimate reward of putting the sutras into practice is that you feel better at every level of your human system, and the potential impact of this on your day-to-day life is limitless. When your mind is less agitated, you experience less anxiety and <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/slideshow/15-poses-help-sleep-better/\">sleep better<\/a>. When you have clearer perception, your confidence increases as you make fewer mistakes. Your relationships become more fulfilling as you take more emotional risks and connect with others from a place of knowing yourself more deeply. When you are more connected with your own needs and tendencies, you can take better care of yourself, whether that means eating more healthfully, finding a new job, or getting enough rest.<\/p><p> Admittedly, putting the sutras into practice off the mat can be especially challenging, but it’s a worthwhile endeavor, and starting with the eight sutras will give you a brief introduction to the transformative power that Patanjali’s simple but fundamental principles can have in your daily life. Consider them tools that are so universal in their approach and applicability, everyone can benefit from them, regardless of their background, experience, or beliefs. If you’ve never contemplated the Yoga Sutra, think of these eight verses as an entryway for accessing the support Patanjali has to offer you in your own life. Perhaps they’ll serve as an invitation to learn more.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/slideshow/sneak-preview-awake-life-yogananda/\">Why Paramahansa Yogananda Was A Man Before His Time<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"><\/a><\/p><h2>Put in the practice<\/h2><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><h3>1.14 <em>sa tu dirgha-kala-nairantarya-satkara-adara-asevita drdha-bhumih<\/em><\/h3><h3>To achieve a strong foundation in our practice, we must practice over a long time, without interruption, believing in it and looking forward to it, with an attitude of service.<\/h3><\/blockquote><p> Whenever you undertake anything new, whether it’s a <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/lifestyle/balance/relationships/\">relationship<\/a>, a job, or a course of study, Patanjali advises you to recognize that there is going to be some effort involved. You must consciously create the foundation you hope to build on. Becoming a parent, starting a business, studying piano, taking up <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/lifestyle/cross-training/yoga-and-climbing/\">rock climbing<\/a>—whatever you’re undertaking, if you approach it with the attitudes described by this sutra, you will experience more joy in the activity itself and you’ll create a solid foundation on which to build the future.<\/p><p> The first guideline Patanjali offers is dirgha-kala, or “long time.” This means recognizing that what you are undertaking cannot be perfected overnight, that you have to commit over time to get lasting results that you are happy with. Nairantarya, the next guideline, translates as “no interruption,” which addresses your continued commitment to the process. Your efforts must be wholehearted; an attitude of a little bit here and a little bit there is not going to help you reach your goal. Imagine trying to learn how to play the piano without practicing regularly, or trying to lose weight while <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/food-diet/\">eating healthfully<\/a> only once in a while.<\/p><p> Satkara, the third guideline, means belief in what you are doing. If you approach a task with uncertainty, or with the attitude that your endeavor will fail, you set yourself up for disappointment. Patanjali advises that if you believe in what you are doing, your efforts will have greater impact. If you’re an activist lobbying for stricter clean-air protocols, for example, you have to believe in the cause if your efforts are going to effectively inspire others to support your work, and it helps you maintain your own momentum and enthusiasm.<\/p><p> Adara refers to the fact that you must look forward to what you’re doing. Whatever you set out to do, Patanjali advises that, on some level, you must enjoy the job at hand. Even if what you’re doing is difficult or tiring, there can still be joy and satisfaction in the effort if you know that you are experiencing something positive from it. Adara is important because, without it, you are prone to burnout or to abandoning your commitment.<\/p><p> Lastly, Patanjali mentions asevita, meaning that you must approach each endeavor with an attitude of service. You can do this by asking yourself, How can I best serve my work? My relationship? This practice? If you are <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/lifestyle/balance/parenting-motherhood/\">parenting<\/a>, one way you can serve that practice is by making sure that you get enough rest, time for yourself, and healthful food, so that when you are with your kids you can be at your best. Service to your efforts might mean getting a good night’s sleep before making a big presentation at work. Or it could simply mean approaching your work—whether it’s volunteering at a nonprofit or running a huge international corporation—with a positive attitude.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/yoga-s-greater-truth/\">The Roots of Yoga: Ancient + Modern<\/a><\/p><div tml-image=\"ci020756ace01825bd\" tml-image-caption=\"\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><h2>Get to know your true self<\/h2><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><h3>2.17 <em>drashtr-drshyayoh samyogo heya-hetuh<\/em><\/h3><h3>The cause of our suffering is the inability to distinguish between what is the truth (what perceives) and what appears to be the truth (what is perceived).<\/h3><h3>2.23 <em>sva-svami-saktyoh svarupa- upalabdhi-hetuh samyogah<\/em><\/h3><h3>The inability to discern between the temporary, fluctuating mind and our own true Self, which is ­eternal, is the cause of our suffering, yet this suffering provides us with the opportunity to make this distinction and to learn and grow from it, by understanding the true nature of each.<\/h3><\/blockquote><p> Patanjali says that the cause of suffering (<em>heya-hetuh<\/em>) is the inability to distinguish (<em>samyoga)<\/em> between two entities—the Self, or seer (<em>drashtr<\/em>), and the mind (<em>drshyam<\/em>), which includes your thoughts and emotions. Distinguishing between the two closely related entities—and understanding the role of each and the relationship between them—is a central goal of yoga and the key to your happiness and peace. Think of it this way: Imagine you’re a personal assistant who works closely with your boss and functions as her representative in public. Now, think about what would happen if you began to feel and act as if you were the boss, eventually forgetting to consult or even recognize your boss. Obviously, some problems would likely occur if this distinction were blurred. So, think of the Self, or seer, as the boss, and the mind as the boss’s instrument or assistant, recognizing the distinct role each one plays. That’s when you will acquire clearer perception.<\/p><p> Of course, one might say that Patanjali recognizes the value of both entities. It’s not that the mind is bad or the Self, or seer, is better. You need your mind, emotions, and identity to live in the world, just as you need your inner compass, or <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/can-see-clearly-now/\">true Self<\/a>.<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> What’s crucial is discerning the role of each and making sure that each entity is acting according to its proper role. The good news is that while the difficulty of distinguishing these two entities can be frustrating, and can even cause you a great deal of discomfort and pain, Patanjali says that the suffering that results when you mistake one for the other actually helps set you on your road to greater clarity.<\/p><p> The mistakes you make, and the pain you feel as a result, serve to guide you toward a greater understanding (upalabdhi—literally “to obtain or go near”) of both the true nature (<em>svarupa<\/em>) of the mind and the true nature of the Self, or seer—“the external that is seen and the internal that sees,” as T. K. V. Desikachar describes them. It is only through this increased understanding of the nature of each and the relationship between them that you are able to differentiate between the two, and hence prevent future suffering.<\/p><p> Instead of being too critical of yourself when you make a mistake, the message here is that you can let go of self-blame, regret, and criticism. By holding on to those thoughts, you are only making yourself more miserable, adding suffering on top of the suffering, so to speak. Patanjali is concerned with the present: You are here now, so it’s irrelevant how you got here, whose fault it was, or how badly you messed up. The important thing is that your mistakes give you a chance to learn something about yourself and to potentially do things differently the next time.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/yoga-101/live-your-yoga-discover-yamas-niyamas/\">Live Your Yoga: Discover the Yamas + Niyamas<\/a><\/p><h2>Walk in someone else’s shoes<\/h2><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><h3>2.33<em> vitarka-badhane pratipaksha-bhavanam <\/em><\/h3><h3>2.34<em> vitarka himsadayah krta-karita-anumodita lobha-krodha-moha-purvaka mrdu-madhya-adhimatra duhkha-ajnana ananta-phalah iti pratipaksha-bhavanam<\/em><\/h3><h3>To avoid hasty actions that may be hurtful, we must practice trying to imagine or visualize the opposite of our first, instinctual reaction. We must see things from a different point of view and weigh the potential consequences.<\/h3><\/blockquote><p> Often, Patanjali’s most powerful advice broadens your view, shifting your frame of reference or offering a new vantage point from which to see things (<em>pratipaksha- bhavanam<\/em>). These shifts might seem simple, but they can have a profound impact on your experience. Patanjali advises that to avoid doing harm by acting hastily, you must try to “visualize the opposite side.”<\/p><p> Patanjali is quite specific in these sutras, explaining that hasty actions that cause harm to others can happen in three ways: You hurt someone directly (<em>krta<\/em>: I am angry, so I kick someone); you hurt someone by way of someone else (<em>karita<\/em>: I ask my friend to kick another on my behalf); or you approve, encourage, or feel glad about harm done to another person (<em>anumodita<\/em>). Patanjali explains some reasons that people harm others, including greed (<em>lobha<\/em>), anger (<em>krodha<\/em>), and delusion or infatuation (<em>moha<\/em>). He then warns that, whether you harm someone a little bit (<em>mrdu<\/em>), an average amount (<em>madhya<\/em>), or a great deal (<em>adhimatra<\/em>), the result for you is the same: endless suffering (<em>duhkha<\/em>) and a lack of clarity (<em>ajnana<\/em>). To avoid this, practice pratipaksha-bhavanam.<\/p><p> Patanjali is a realist. He is not saying that you should not have legitimate feelings, or that you should judge yourself for feeling the way you do. He is reminding you that if you think badly of another, that person doesn’t suffer—you do. If you actually harm another person, you will likely suffer as much as, if not more than, the person you harm.<\/p><p> Patanjali offers this advice not so that you can become the citizen of the year, but so you can be happier and more fulfilled. It might sound selfish, but the most supportive thing you can do for the world is to focus on your own personal growth and transformation, and then act from that place in the world.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/slideshow/ask-expert-three-must-reads-beginner-yogis/\">Ask the Expert: What Are 3 Must-Reads for Beginner Yogis?<\/a><\/p><div tml-image=\"ci02075693c00525bd\" tml-image-caption=\"\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><h2>Tap into your inner strength<\/h2><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><h3>1.20<em> shraddha-virya-smrti-samadhi-prajna-purvakah itaresham <\/em><\/h3><h3>For those of us who were not born into states of higher consciousness or knowing, we must cultivate self-confidence and conviction to help us maintain our persistence and strength, and to remember our direction so that we may attain our goal of a focused mind and clear perception.<\/h3><\/blockquote><p> Often translated as “faith,” <em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/importance-identifying-shraddha-dharma/\">shraddha<\/a><\/em> is more appropriately translated as “self-esteem,” “personal conviction,” “self-confidence,” or “determination.” If you are consciously making an effort to achieve greater clarity (<em>itaresham<\/em>), your conviction (<em>shraddha<\/em>) will be followed by the strength and persistence (<em>virya<\/em>) to remember your direction (<em>smrti<\/em>) and to reach your goal of total and clear understanding (<em>samadhi-prajna<\/em>).<\/p><p> Practically speaking, shraddha is your inner strength; when you’re lost in the woods and it’s getting dark, shraddha is your deep inner trust that you will find a way to make a fire, get warm, and find something to eat. It’s the guiding force inside that urges you to keep putting one foot in front of the other until you come out of the woods. This resource is one of your greatest assets—a way to help you connect to your own true Self or the place of quiet light within.<\/p><p> Later, in sutra 1.22, Patanjali indicates that shraddha is apt to wane and fluctuate. We all have days when we feel more confident and self-assured, and days when we doubt ourselves. Shraddha is unique to each person: You might have just a little bit, or you might have a lot. The potential to cultivate shraddha is within you, though you might not be aware of that potential, or use it to your advantage. The right support (a good teacher, friend, partner, or mentor) can help you cultivate and strengthen shraddha.<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> Most daily challenges aren’t as dramatic as being lost in the woods. But if you’re facing a stressful time at work or dealing with an illness or a difficult relationship, it helps to remember that within you is the strength that can carry you through the hardest of times. Even if things become so difficult that you forget your inner strength, it is still there.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/yoga-religion/\">Is Yoga a Religion?<\/a><\/p><h2>Align your attitude<\/h2><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><h3>1.33<em> maitri-karuna-mudita- upekshanam sukha-duhkha- punyapunya-visayanam bhavanatah-citta-prasadanam <\/em><\/h3><h3>An attitude of friendliness toward those who are happy, compassion toward those who are suffering, pleasure and delight at those who are doing good deeds in the world, and nonjudgmental watchfulness toward those who do harmful deeds will help us to attain a peaceful and balanced mind.<\/h3><\/blockquote><p> Recognizing that you can change your mood by shifting your attitude is an important step toward easing suffering. But implementing the attitudes Patanjali suggests is not always easy. Patanjali says you should feel friendliness (<em>maitri<\/em>) toward those who are happy (<em>sukha<\/em>). This seems like obvious advice, but how often, when others are happy, do we find ourselves <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/nothing-to-envy/\">feeling jealous<\/a>, or bad about ourselves, with thoughts like “Why didn’t I get that raise? Why didn’t I win the lottery? Maybe that person cheated! They don’t deserve it!”<\/p><p> Likewise, Patanjali says you should have compassion (<em>karuna<\/em>) for those who are suffering (<em>duhkha<\/em>). But instead of compassion, you might feel responsible for saving them, guilty about their misfortune, or fearful that what happened to them could happen to you.<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> When others are doing good deeds in the world (<em>punya<\/em>), instead of feeling joy (<em>mudita<\/em>), you might feel critical of yourself for not doing the same, or even suspicious about their motives or integrity. Perhaps most difficult of all, Patanjali says that you should try to maintain an attitude of nonjudgmental watchfulness or observance (<em>upeksa<\/em>) toward those people who are doing harmful deeds in the world (<em>apunya<\/em>). This can be extremely challenging. How often do you jump in and place blame, taking sides without knowing the full picture?<\/p><p> Patanjali uses the word upeksa intentionally: He’s not telling you to hide your head in the sand, but to observe from a safe distance and with nonjudgment. If you can adopt these attitudes, you will receive the blessings of a calm, peaceful, and balanced mind (<em>citta-prasadanam<\/em>). And through this, your path will become clear.<\/p><p> Remember, the Yoga Sutra is a guide to feeling better in daily life, not to becoming a saint, and sometimes the best action isn’t the most heroic one. I once got between two dogs that were fighting to break them up. Without thinking, I tried to pull the dogs apart and ended up getting a bad bite. Had I not reacted so quickly, I might have thought of a better solution, like using a stick to separate them, or asking for help from someone more experienced. Similarly, if you witness an injustice on the street and get in the middle of it, you’re putting yourself in a position of conflict, and could become injured. But if you observe, trying not to pass judgment, you will be able to respond more clearly and act effectively while preserving your peace of mind and your personal well-being.<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci020756ad001725bd\" tml-image-caption=\"\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><h2>Find your inner compass<\/h2><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><h3>1.29<em> tatah pratyak-cetana adhigamo’py antarayabhavas ca <\/em><\/h3><h3>Those who have a meaningful connection with something greater than themselves will come to know their own true Selves and experience a reduction in those obstacles that may deter them from reaching their goal.<\/h3><\/blockquote><p> Once you are linked with something beyond your own identity, two things happen, says Patanjali: First, the inner consciousness (<em>pratyak-cetana<\/em>) is revealed (<em>adhigamah<\/em>) as the Self; second, the obstacles that deter you on your path (<em>antaraya<\/em>) are reduced and eventually extinguished (<em>abhava<\/em>). Coming to a place of independence from these obstacles of the mind facilitates a deeper connection with your own inner compass—that quiet, peaceful place within. When you are connected to this inner compass, you are better able to handle the twists and turns of life. You don’t take things so personally. Your mood generally remains stabler. You see things more clearly, and so you are able to make choices that serve you better. As Patanjali says, it is almost as though you become independent of the effects of whatever is occurring around you. You can experience it without absorbing it or identifying with it. You have the distance and perspective to see that what you’re experiencing is not who you are, but rather something that’s happening to you, and you can therefore move through it with greater ease.<\/p><p> I experimented with this soon after a friend’s wife died, when he started shouting at me one evening in front of a group of people. Somehow, without effort, I understood that he was not really angry at me. I recognized that he was in fact extremely sad about his wife’s death, and, even though he was saying terrible things to me, my ego did not step up and feel humiliated. Nor did I get defensive and retaliate by saying terrible things back to him that I would later regret.<\/p><p> Instead, I had an awareness that extended beyond my own immediate experience, which, while it certainly wasn’t pleasant, was not devastating or even hurtful because I was clear that it was not about me. I did not feel anger, embarrassment, or any of the other things I might have felt had I been acting from my <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/yoga-101/sophisticated-ego/\">ego or emotions<\/a>. Instead, I felt deep compassion and understanding for my friend. I knew he did not want to hurt me, and I knew how much he was hurting.<\/p><p> The results of putting the principles of the Yoga Sutra into practice show up in moments like this, when you least expect them, with gifts of clarity and compassion. It’s here, in your relationships with others, in your moods, in your reactions to life’s situations, that you know your yoga practice is working, helping you to stay anchored, calm, and stable.<\/p><p> In these moments, you are able to respond from a place of love and trust, of compassion and nonjudgment. You shine from your center as a result of being connected to something deep within you as well as beyond you. When you are connected to your core and acting from that place within, you will find that you can handle almost any situation with much greater ease and clarity.<\/p><p><strong>Kate Holcombe is founder and executive director of the nonprofit Healing Yoga Foundation in San Francisco and a longtime private student of T. K. V.

Learn to accept this gift, and you'll feel reborn.<\/h3><p> Of the many crisis calls I've received, one in particular stands out. A good friend had awakened one morning to a note on her pillow: Her husband was leaving her for another woman. Though the marriage had been rocky at best, she was devastated. \"Why did this happen to me?\" she sobbed. \"I just want to be married again!\"<\/p><p> When things fall apart, as they did for my friend, it's tempting to try to piece them together as quickly as possible and get your old life back. Yet when you do that, you miss what a crisis can offer: an awakening to what's not working in your life, an opening to the potential for change.<\/p><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p>A spiritual initiation—an exceptionally difficult life passage that shakes your foundations and makes you question your purpose—is just this sort of sea change. It's an opportunity disguised as loss; a chance to strengthen the thread of awareness that connects the outer part of your being to the inner, to descend deeper into the soul.<\/p><\/blockquote><p> It's human nature to avoid the emotional roadblocks that pepper the path to spiritual maturity, to seek instead the slow and steady pace of the ordinary traveler. Yet reaching higher spiritual ground requires an extraordinary traveler. It demands the kind of sea change that arrives at key junctures and can transport you to a higher level of spiritual functioning.<\/p><p> A spiritual initiation—an exceptionally difficult life passage that shakes your foundations and makes you question your purpose—is just this sort of sea change. It's an opportunity disguised as loss; a chance to strengthen the thread of awareness that connects the outer part of your being to the inner, to descend deeper into the soul.<\/p><p> As a psychologist, yoga instructor, and yoga therapist, I have helped many clients through initiations. Going through this process, I've noticed that yoga, which helps reveal the workings of the mind, provides tools to help you navigate an initiation and jump-start your progress on the <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/yoga-101/yoga-off-the-mat-spirituality/\">spiritual path<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Stay Aware Through&nbsp;Spiritual Transitions<\/h2><p> Spiritual initiations are transitional; they leave you between worlds. Like a snake undergoing a brief period of blindness after shedding its skin, you're temporarily sightless: You're neither your old self nor a new one. This amorphous, transitional feeling can be challenging—and it can manifest itself in all areas of your life.<\/p><p> A client of mine in her late 50s who had been on the verge of a life change for years came to me with acute anxiety and insomnia. During class, I noticed she moved through the transitions between poses with her eyes closed. She similarly \"spaced out\" during life transitions, hurrying through or avoiding them, which built up internal pressure. The mission during spiritual initiations is to slow down and look straight into your soul, and to root out the <em>kleshas<\/em>, the afflictions of spiritual ignorance that can block your progress.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/practice-section/breathwork-for-anxiety/\">Beat Anxiety with Breathwork<\/a><\/p><h2>Heed the Call to Awaken Spiritually<\/h2><p> The feeling that your life is coming undone is the call to awakening that begins an initiation. The call can take many forms: illness or accident, betrayal by a spouse, the death of a loved one, an urge to enter psychotherapy or to begin a period of self-examination, the recognition of an unhealthy situation or relationship. This is an opportunity to transcend the lament \"Why is this happening to me?\" and to seek a greater purpose behind the crisis. During this acute phase you'll most likely experience a klesha called <em>asmita<\/em>, which is a disruption of the ego, or sense of \"I am,\" and a tendency to cling to old definitions of Self: the Provider, the Responsible One, the Caretaker, the Black Sheep, the Boss, the Martyr, and so on. When you answer the call to awakening, you leave behind, at least for a while, this familiar territory and may feel unmoored.<\/p><p> You can counter this instability by centering yourself with <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/yoga-101/types-of-yoga/restorative-types-of-yoga/\">restorative yoga<\/a> and by connecting with your breath, either through formal <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/category/types/pranayama/\">pranayama<\/a> (breath control) or by simply focusing on the inflow and outflow of your breath. Imagine that thread of awareness connecting your outer mind with your deepest inner Self; with each exhalation, descend further down that thread of awareness into the center of your being. This growing connection to your deepest Self will help during the most difficult parts of your awakening.<\/p><h2>Face the Void Between Yourself and Your Self<\/h2><p> As you leave your unhealthy world behind, you may experience a profound sense of separation. This letting go has a parallel in your yoga practice; you may need to temporarily relinquish your usual form of yoga in exchange for a more grounding, internally reflective practice.<\/p><p> One of my yoga therapy clients, diagnosed with cancer, struggled to maintain his vigorous vinyasa practice while exhausted from chemotherapy. If he couldn't practice vinyasa, he felt, it wasn't worth practicing at all. Gradually he realized his harsh mental attitude was interfering with his recovery. He began a restorative practice and discovered that its quiet and calm gave him needed support, helping him mobilize his inner resources toward healing.<\/p><p> This is where another klesha, <em>dvesha<\/em> (an aversion to pain), comes into play. Your challenge now is to take a good look at the way you've been living and to weed out old habits and beliefs that once fortified your ego but no longer serve you: an abusive or lifeless relationship, an addiction, a history of powerlessness, overwork, or the glare of self-hatred, for example. As you do this, you're left to face the great canyon of emptiness that lies underneath. While it can be frightening, facing this inner void clears the slate, making way for change and regeneration.<\/p><p> To renew and conserve energy, you can cultivate <em><a href=\"/wisdom/459\">pratyahara<\/a><\/em> (a turning inward of the senses), which is the fifth of the eight limbs of yoga. Pratyahara helps you sit with pain without being consumed by it or overidentifying with it.<\/p><h2>Explore&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Dark Side<\/h2><p> Now you're ready for an extraordinary pilgrimage into the depths of your own Underworld. Here, you simultaneously suffer the death of who you thought you were and encounter your shadow side: the parts you keep hidden, the qualities, behaviors, and motivations that may be difficult for you to acknowledge.<\/p><p> The tasks of facing the Underworld and your shadow provoke the klesha called <em>abhinivesha<\/em>, which is a fear of death and the tendency to cling to life. Though painful, the death of the ego is essential so that, like the mythical phoenix, you can rise from the ashes and come to life again in a more mature form. Suffering and death break through the defensive structures that frame our personalities, so we can get closer to our souls.<\/p><p> To emerge intact from this stage, it's helpful to explore <em><a href=\"/wisdom/461/\">samadhi<\/a><\/em> (the eighth limb of the yogic path), a total absorption with the Divine, or deepest Self. You can do this most effectively in <a href=\"http://yogajournal.com/poses/482\">Savasana<\/a> (Corpse Pose), which normally comes at the end of a yoga practice. All too often, we shortchange Savasana, thinking perhaps we can't afford to lie and rest; yet it creates a space for the blending of all eight limbs of yoga for the awakening of our deepest Self. A student recently confessed she'd been leaving class just before Savasana; in the midst of a traumatic breakup, she feared it would feel too \"deathlike,\" that her feelings of grief and loss would overwhelm her. But Savasana's full surrender to the process of death was just what she needed. Realizing it could help her move on, she began to enter Savasana earlier in her practice and stay in it longer.<\/p><h2>Find the Oasis<\/h2><p> The contraction and suffering experienced with the death of the ego can close your heart and make you feel dry, barren, and exiled. This may seem like a spiritual wasteland, but it's one of the richest and most verdant paths of your awakening. Although you might not yet see it, the seeds of your new self are sprouting beneath the soil of your awareness. This is often when the klesha <em>avidya<\/em> (ignorance or delusion) is stimulated: You can't see what you'll grow into. You may also have trouble recognizing the last stage of your transition for what it is—a passage through the birth canal.<\/p><p> Instead, avidya compels you to rush into your fledgling spiritual self, to restructure your life, to build a new ego and end this seemingly endless period of waiting. To contain the tension of waiting for your new form, you can call upon <em><a href=\"/practice/meditation/\">dhyana<\/a><\/em> (meditation). Dhyana teaches patience, so you can sit with whatever is present and act in the context of mindfulness. It helps you tune in to the voice of the soul and let that voice guide you.<\/p><h2>Begin Again and Again<\/h2><p> Finally, after all this waiting, you move through the birth canal and are reborn. This is when the klesha called <em>raga<\/em> (attachment to pleasure) gets stirred up. Now that you've moved away from suffering and death, you're loath to reexperience it. You may rush to form an attachment to your new identity. Yet if you're interested in spiritual development, you don't want to get too comfortable. If spiritual maturity is truly your priority, you must be ready to leave the comfort zone and begin again and again, as many times as it takes. Don't get distracted by the siren song of raga.<\/p><p> A spiritual initiation is like a carving knife—it cuts and pierces, but also refines and reshapes you. Initiations allow you to reinvent yourself completely, to give yourself over to something greater. They are windows through which you can glimpse who you really are and what's possible for you. They're not just an emotional necessity; they're a spiritual imperative.<\/p><p> As you learn to recognize and accept the extraordinary power of change and develop the art of surrender, you'll be rewarded with an awakening of the natural alignment between body, mind, and spirit that already exists within you.<\/p><h2>The Karma of the 5 Kleshas<\/h2><p> According to the Yoga Sutra (Book II), there are five kleshas, or afflictions, that, like clever sorcerers, can knock you off balance or sidetrack you in your quest for spiritual evolution.<\/p><h3>Avidya<\/h3><p> The inability to see things for what they are; this causes you to mistake transient, ego-related matters for permanent, soul-related ones.<\/p><h3>Asmita<\/h3><p> The tendency to overidentify with your ego; this keeps you from connecting with your soul.<\/p><h3>Raga<\/h3><p> The flame of desire that causes addiction to pleasure; this discourages you from leaving your comfort zone for more evolved territory.<\/p><h3>Dvesha<\/h3><p> The aversion to pain; this creates a quicksand-like cycle of misery and self-hatred that sucks you under and suffocates your will to evolve.<\/p><h3>Abhinivesha<\/h3><p> The fear of death or a clinging to life; this dilutes your focus and interferes with your ability to experience the spiritual freedom that is the goal of yoga.<\/p><p><em>Also see&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/importance-identifying-shraddha-dharma/\">Find Your Purpose Using Shraddha and Dharma<\/a><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci0207568d10392620","ci0207568dd00525bd"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci0207568dd00525bd","primaryImageId":"ci020756a710182620","path":"/yoga-101/awakening","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci0207568d10392620"},{"$ref":"ci020767eee00025bd"},{"$ref":"ci0207568dd00525bd"},{"$ref":"ci0207568dd00725bd"},{"$ref":"ci0207568e401725bd"},{"$ref":"ci0207688760002620"}],"socialPopularity":12,"slug":"awakening","contentNodeId":"cn020756aa90032620","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2017-04-05T18:34:57Z","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-04-03T20:11:20Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci0207568e800c2620","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","isNoindex":false,"title":"BO FORBES","slug":"bo-forbes","disqusId":"b30d48bc-18a9-11e7-9076-0280f27e34ed","path":"/author/bo-forbes","migrationId":"ContentUserProfile:bo-forbes"},"teaser":"A personal crisis can be a gift on the path to spiritual maturity.

It is the same every morning. Somewhere between sleep and waking, a certain ground-level awareness begins to creep in. I could call it by different names: a feeling of smallness in the face of the universe, an awareness of the inevitability of <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/kleshas-fear-of-death-abhinivesha/\">death<\/a>, or—increasingly these days—a parental concern for the son and daughter still sleeping in bed nearby.<\/p><p> When I was younger, I could sometimes wake without this feeling. Now it is my constant companion. Some people insist that peace of mind be the fruit of spiritual practice. There is truth in that, but it isn't the kind of peace that refuses to acknowledge the basic situation you find yourself confronted with in life. Eventually all that you love and all that you hold onto will simply pass away. I am reminded of a verse from the Psalms: \"His breath goes forth, and he returns to the earth; in that very day his thoughts perish\" (Ps.146:6). That is why I wake saying <em>Namu-amida-butsu<\/em>: \"I entrust myself to Amida, the Buddha of Immeasurable Light and Life.\" There's nothing else to do.<\/p><h3>The Way of the Name<\/h3><p> Of course, reciting the name of Amida is a matter of personal conviction. I arrived at that practice after a decade-long struggle, during which I called on all sorts of other names—from Jesus to Tara, Allah to Avalokiteshvara. In retrospect, any of them would have worked had I been able to surrender to them. For me, in the end, it was Amida, the primordial <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/lifestyle/back-to-buddha/\">Buddha<\/a> who, according to the Pure Land Sutras of Mahayana Buddhism, vowed countless eons ago to save all beings <em>without distinction<\/em>—without regard to whether they were good or evil, wise or foolish, happy or sad.<\/p><p> That was the key point for me. I had lived long enough to know how often in life I acted against my better nature and how powerless I was in most cases to act in any other way. That was what the Buddha called <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/lifestyle/seeds-change/\"><em>karma<\/em><\/a>, and I was quite certain, after 20 years of Zen practice had failed to eradicate it, there was no way I could ever become free of it on my own. I tried taking my karma before various different \"names,\" but for whatever reason I never had the sense that any of the <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/video/video/who-s-your-deity/\">deities<\/a> or bodhisattvas they signified were willing to accept me as I was. Until Amida. Amida seemed to say, \"Come as you are.\" And for some reason I could, and I did. I make no special claims for Amida. The \"name\" you surrender to is an individual matter.<\/p><p> Having said that, I think it is important to find <em>some<\/em> kind of name to call on and some way of calling on it. Otherwise you are likely to find yourself surrendering to \"the will of the universe\" or some other kind of daytime talk-show abstraction. To <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/yoga-off-the-mat-spirituality/get-carried-away/\">surrender<\/a>, you have to have something to surrender to; it doesn't work surrendering to something you can't call out to and from which you can't reasonably expect a reply. This is one reason why meditation practices the world over, if they don't already consist of the mantra-like repetition of a divine name, find some way of incorporating such a name—in their liturgy at the very least.<\/p><p> Think of it this way: If you fall forward, you can always catch yourself by putting a foot forward. In fact, that is exactly what you do when walking. You fall forward and catch yourself over and over again. That is how you accomplish most things in life, walking here or there under your own power, doing whatever it is you do. But what about falling back? When you fall backward, it is impossible to catch yourself. If you are to be caught, someone or something else must do the catching. This is an excellent metaphor for death—physical or spiritual. To die in either case, you must fall backward—into a realm you cannot see. To do this you must have the sense there is something there to catch you, some \"other power\" that can save you when you cannot save yourself. Otherwise your <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/4-secrets-overcoming-fear-stepping-outside-comfort-zone/\">fear<\/a> of annihilation is too great to allow for such a fall.<\/p><p> Naturally, there are those times when you fall because you can't help it, and sometimes that is how you come by your \"name.\" Twelve Step meetings are filled with stories like this. They are common as well among born-again Christians, who frequently talk about being saved by Jesus when they least expected or deserved it, usually as the result of a <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/meditation/meditation-personal-renewal-with-elena-brower/\">personal<\/a> crisis or some other kind of \"fall.\" That is not the kind of falling backward I am talking about here, however, because it is impossible to practice that kind of fall. It happens or it doesn't, and in either case you have no say.<\/p><p> There is another kind of falling back in which you <em>do<\/em> have a say because you have a practice, and that practice is saying the name. This type of practice, which I think of as the \"Way of the Name,\" exists in some form or other in virtually every major spiritual <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/reading-list/\">tradition<\/a>, and so there is no need to convert to Buddhism to practice it. You could as easily say the Jesus prayer of Orthodox <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/meditation/guided-meditation-christian-tradition/\">Christianity<\/a> (\"Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me\") or the Hail Mary of the Catholic Church, both time-honored ways of falling backward into the arms of God. In <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/uncategorized/yoga-and-islam-reconcilable-differences/\">Islam<\/a> there is the practice of reciting the 99 names of Allah, and there are variations of this same practice in Hinduism and Sikhism. Nearly all of these practices, including the <em>nembutsu<\/em> (the recitation of <em>Namu-amida-butsu<\/em>), make use of prayer beads of one kind or another, either as a way of keeping track of how many prayers one says or simply as a reminder to pray. It is here that the Way of the Name finds its most practical, hands-on expression.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/yoga-religion/\">Is Yoga a Religion?<\/a><\/p><h3>Counting the Ways<\/h3><p> In the Japanese Buddhist tradition, such beads have two names—<em>juzu<\/em> and <em>nenju<\/em>—each of which suggests a different approach to the Way of the Name. The word <em>ju<\/em> means \"<a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/slideshow/find-perfect-mala/\">bead<\/a>.\" <em>Zu<\/em> means \"to count,\" and <em>nen<\/em> means \"thought.\" Thus, <em>juzu<\/em> are \"counting beads,\" whereas <em>nenju<\/em> are \"thought beads.\"<\/p><p> Counting beads are used as a way of extending and maintaining one's practice of the Way. You begin by reciting the name a given number of times each day (often on the advice of a master or spiritual friend), then increase the number gradually until you are saying the name more or less continuously throughout each day. A famous example of this style of practice comes from the nineteenth-century spiritual classic <em>The Way of a Pilgrim<\/em>, in which the anonymous author begins reciting the Jesus prayer 3,000 times a day on the advice of his staretz, or elder, using a knotted \"prayer rope\" to keep track of how many times he says it. After a few weeks, the staretz gives him leave to say 6,000 <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/answer-to-your-prayers/\">prayers<\/a> a day, and shortly after that, 12,000. At that point he instructs the pilgrim to recite the prayer as often as possible without bothering to keep track of the number of recitations: \"Simply strive to devote every waking moment to prayer.\"<\/p><p> At its best, bead-counting practice results in an every-moment awareness of the Divine. Like the vine that begins as a small shoot and by midsummer covers the entire length of a fence, these counted prayers have a natural way of multiplying themselves until suddenly, after some months or years of practice, it seems one's whole life bursts into flower. But it can also become a purely mechanical exercise, in which case it does little more than tranquilize the mind.<\/p><p> For a while I said the Jesus prayer as many as 12,000 times a day. It wasn't possible to do much else on days when I said the prayer that many times. And then, paradoxically, it was actually harder to keep my mind on Jesus than when I was saying a more modest number. I kept calculating how many times I had said it—say, by noon—and wondering if I would make it to 12,000 by the end of the day. Finally I felt too foolish to continue in this way. Unlike some of the other practices I'd undertaken, I lacked a spiritual director for this <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/slideshow/experiment-one-yoga-skeptic-six-classes-change-mind/\">experiment<\/a>, and it seemed wise to forego such an unauthorized assault on heaven.<\/p><p> Not long afterward, I discovered the nembutsu (nem is a variation on<em> nen<\/em>—thus, nem-butsu means \"to think on Buddha\"). In the nembutsu tradition of the Jodo Shin-shu (\"True Pure Land School\") of Buddhism, the beads are called nenju, and generally are not used for counting.<\/p><p> Similar in most ways to the \"power beads\" that became popular in America a few years ago, they are worn on the left wrist during religious services or private devotions. When one chants the nembutsu, the hands are brought together, palm to palm, with the beads encircling both hands. While chanting Namu-amida-butsu, one makes no conscious effort to enter into a meditative state through mantra-like recitation, nor is there any effort to visualize Amida Buddha seated on a lotus throne in his Pure Land. One simply expresses gratitude for Amida welcoming all beings just the way they are. In this way the meditation happens on its own—less the result of intention than of simple trust.<\/p><p> It is here, in my opinion, that the Way of the Name finds its ultimate expression—not in nembutsu practice per se, but in any practice which, through <a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/uncategorized/my-journey-to-faith/\">faith<\/a>, accepts as already given that which we seek, whether it be called mercy, rebirth in the Pure Land, divine union, or oneness with reality as it is. If surrender is what is called for in the end, then there is nothing to do but fall. There is no need to put it off by counting to a million. The Way of the Name consists in saying it—and believing it—here and now. It is not really hard. You fall anyway in the end. The difference between falling then and falling now is a life of gratitude, humility, and love.<\/p><p><em>See also&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/seeing-spirituality-everything-om%25E2%2580%258B-omg/\">Seeing the Spirituality in Everything from OM​ to OMG<\/a><\/p><p><strong>About our author<\/strong><\/p><p> Clark Strand is a former Zen Buddhist monk and the author of <em>Seeds from a Birch Tree: Writing Haiku and the Spiritual Journey and The Wooden Bowl: Simple Meditation for Everyday Life<\/em>.
