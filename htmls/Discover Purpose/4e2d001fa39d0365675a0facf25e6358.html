Any one person will encounter times in their life when they feel stuck or trapped. Friends can offer some help but often the friendship itself disallows you from receiving the appropriate help, challenge and insight needed to make the appropriate changes or adjustments.<br> <br> My work centers on marriages in crisis, the effects of affairs, the damage of pornography addictions, the hopelessness of mood disorders (depression, anxiety etc,), the frustration of inappropriate anger and the paralysis caused by low self-acceptance. Equipped with an honors degree in clinical psychology and certified as a pastoral counselor, I am able to help my clients from not only a clinical perspective but also a spiritual one as well.<br> <br> Involvement with our Mood Disorder Program, author of a manual on marriage and currently writing a book on marriage are just some of the extracurricular activities I am involved with. Married with five children I also have the experiential understanding that furthers my ability to help you or your marriage get back on track.</span> </p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> <strong> &nbsp; </strong> </p> </td>

               <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 14px;">This is a quote that has guided me through the years. For me, helping my clients re-gain their self-esteem and thrive is the most satisfying experience.</p> 
               <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 14px;">Life is not always easy. Families are not perfect. Babies don’t come with instructions. Through emphatic listening and some psychoeducation together we will find alternatives. &nbsp;Despite all difficulties loving and caring will always get you through.</p> 
               <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 14px;">Over 20 years in the mental health field I have gained a vast experience treating problems such as:&nbsp; Child development issues (feeding problems; toiletry training; sleep disturbances); school phobia; gender identity issues; divorce; blended families; separation anxiety and attachment disturbances; discipline and anger management; depression; grief; abuse and trauma. I have worked and volunteered at very different settings: Agencies; Hospitals; Schools; Correctional institutions, etc. always advocating for children suffering from any type of abuse. Since I was trained abroad I did my internship and final thesis at the Sexual Abuse Clinic of the Children’s Psychiatric Hospital in Mexico City, I received an award on my thesis because I was a pioneer on the subject. I graduated and continued my formation as a Child and Youth Psychoanalytic Psychotherapist. I started my private practice always reserving space for children victims of abuse. My studies have been assessed as equivalent by University of Toronto, I am a Registered Psychotherapist and a member in good standing with OACCPP.</p> 
               <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 14px;">Recently I have worked helping adult clients recovering from MVA, and conducting CBT groups for women victims of Domestic Violence. Recovery from trauma can be tough. My consistency and caring patience has helped me and my clients to achieve that recovery even in some very difficult cases.</p> 
               <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 14px;">I welcome the opportunity of sharing your story, your suffering and your successes overcoming life’s turns, just give me a call.</p>

Going through it alone is optional. The last 10 years of working with youth, adults, couples and families has taught me the importance of strong relationships to help weather the storms of life. My Bachelors Degree in Psychology and Masters Degree in Counselling from Trinity Western University focused on marriage and family therapy because relationship difficulties, anxiety, depression and addictions are best understood in the context of our closest relationships. In our sessions together, I strive to create a safe environment where we can talk about the messy partsof life in an open and honest manner. I present a menu of options for treatment and trust you to know which is going tobe the best fit in your own life at this time. From there I take a practical and supportive approach to helping your each your goals. </p> <p>Marriage: There’s nothing that compares to the feeling of finding that one special someone you want to <em>annoy </em>the rest of your life. If you’re having problems in your marriage, you are not alone. Come explore techniques proven to decrease conflict, minimize stress, and increase intimacy and enjoyment of your marriage. Whether working through tough issues, such as infidelity or abuse, or seeking to increase communication skills, I can support you through the hard work of building a relationship that lasts a life time. Relationships are worth fighting for, and I’m in your corner.</p> <p>I utilize Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy when helping individuals work through Mental Health Disorders (Anxiety, Depression, Anger Management, Borderline, or Bipolar). The goals focus on increasing emotional regulation and assertiveness skills – being able to ask for what you want and need from others in an honest and respectful way, as well as learning to tolerate hard emotions like anger, hurt, and disappointment when people do not respond as we hope. These essential skills build and maintain strong relationships. I take great joy in hearing my clients’ reports of employing these skills to gain better relationships with their family and friends during our time together. </p> <p>When working with addictions, I take a harm reduction approach. I help you gain more information about the substance you use, or the compulsive behavior you engage in, so that you can make informed decisions. I make no presumptions thatyou will want to completely quit these behaviors, as they often serve an important function in your life. Rather I strive to help you make choices that minimize the harm of these substances and behaviors, while increasing your knowledge and awareness of what role they’ve played in your past so that you can choose how big their role is your future.</p> <p> <em> “If you’re goingthrough hell, keep going.”</em>– Winston Churchill</p> &nbsp;</td>

Then I had another. And another. At first, I thought they were nothing. Then, suddenly, they were everything. It wasn’t until I reached out to my guidance counsellor that I realized how much I wanted, and needed, help. Some time later, when the tough days were becoming increasingly rare, I was able to recognize that the counsellor to whom I had been referred had saved my life. More than that, I knew that if I wanted to feel accomplished in this life, I would use my own experiences with depression and anxiety in order to help those who came after me.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I have spent years studying counselling and working within the mental health and addictions fields and while my experiences have helped teach me and change me, the one thing they have not changed is my desire to work with and support individuals. Working with a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology from Brescia University College and a Masters in Counselling Psychology from Yorkville University, my counselling focus often reflects the beginning of my own journey as I seek to support children and adolescents who may be experiencing their own string of tough days. In this way, I strive to make individuals feel safe as they share their stories, so that we can work together to identify and build on the skills and qualities they already have to overcome their struggles. Though I do most of my work in cognitive behavioural therapy and narrative therapy, I also have experience with and enjoy working with exposure therapy, attachment therapy, family systems therapy and Christian therapy.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If you are experiencing your own struggles, I would love to meet you and work with you so that you can overcome the struggles that are so uniquely yours.

I started role-playing as a counselor to my peers and later on in life chose psychology as a profession. After graduating with a Master’s degree, I was lucky enough to start working with families and children in school settings for seven years. My focus was on helping children adapt to daily stressors, challenges and milestones of growing up, while collaborating with their families to ensure that their needs are met. I went on to work with adults in a therapeutic setting focusing on challenges that arise from tackling Anxiety and Depression for two years. I am currently working towards promoting mental health and well-being of vulnerable populations who have experienced loss, trauma and displacement. <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span>Although I am eclectic with my approach to counseling, most of my formal training has been in the CBT framework.

But, dear friend, you don’t have to journey alone. You don’t have to struggle through this difficult time by yourself… let us journey together.</span> <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">People are created with a greater resiliency than they realize… and it is my passion to support and strengthen people through the rough patches along the way. Having completed my B.A. in Psychology and wrapping up my M.Div. in Clinical&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Counseling</span>, I utilize a strength-based approach to psychotherapy. Through an integration of interventions from Cognitive Behavioural&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Therapy&nbsp;</span>(CBT), Narrative&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Therapy,</span> and Family Systems Theory, I have worked with individuals at various life stages struggling with issues which include: anxiety, depression, anger, trauma, abuse, self-injury and more.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I also work with couples to develop their communication skills when resolving conflict in their relationship. My approach involves utilizing premarital and relationship counseling&nbsp;tools (such as Prepare-Enrich) and theoretical frameworks (such as the Gottman Model and Emotionally Focused Couple&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Therapy</span>) to establish a safe space for partners to share their thoughts and feelings; thereby, allowing them to journey together more fully.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Though it can be difficult to see past this dark stretch of the road, this is not the end. There is a light which this shadow cannot overcome. So let us journey with hope, for in the words of Francois Jacob, “It is hope that gives life meaning. And hope is based on the prospect of being able one day to turn the actual world into a possible one that looks better.”</span></p> </td>

Soon, I realized that couples work was incomplete without knowing the nuances of the dance of intimacy, where a lot of dynamics play out. As such, I became proficient in sex therapy&nbsp;to compliment my couples’ work, and learned that it was the ultimate body language. So I delved deeper into sexual issues such as safety, comfort, mutual understanding, meaningful connection, trauma, abuse, miscommunication, and how we define ourselves via our intimate relationships and become defined by our sexuality – e.g. while we say we have a cardiac condition or were diagnosed with diabetes or cancer, when it comes to sex we are impotent, inorgasmic, infertile, unfulfilled, and so on. Since sex is such a crucial part of our being – which can bring us the greatest joy or pain, depending upon the context – I made it my mission to provide a safe and non-judgmental place for individuals to open up and share their deepest fears, debilitating perversions, traumatic wounds, and addictions that ruin God’s plan for our bodies. While I’ve done a lot of individual psychotherapy and couples work around various issues for over seven years, what has given me the greatest joy is helping people get back on the right track, after infidelity, sexual trauma, sex or porn addiction, body image issues, child abuse, and sexual dysfunction and/or misconduct have ruined their lives.&nbsp;<br> <br> Beyond my private practice, I’ve been a media personality for ten years, as a host of various radio and TV shows, workshop leader, public speaker, advice columnist, and media expert on critical issues. Due to my strong voice, I was asked to host a call-in show after Sue Johanson’s retirement nearly four years ago. As such, I’m currently hosting Sex @ 11 with Rebecca – a twice-weekly, live, call-in TV show, with over 500 hundred hours of TV and another 500 hours of radio experience. The questions I get indicate a great need, since there are many who remain trapped in dark places for their entire lives, not knowing that help is at hand.<br> <br> </span> </p> </td>

Life offers us all mountain top and valley experiences, which provide opportunities to discover, learn, grow and even develop greater relationships.

A story that shapes who you are. Oftentimes people don’t feel permission to share their story. My hope is to create an environment where you are able to share freely without feeling like you are being judged or like you are the only one who has struggles. My goal is for you to better understand yourself, and also to learn tools for how to become more confident in who you are created to be. Sharing our stories helps us understand who we are, what drives us, and where we need to go. I would be honoured to listen to yours.&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 21.92px;">If you're reading this and have an underlying anxiety that therapy is for the weak or “weird” let me assure you that we all have imperfections and our own struggles. My hope is to create a safe place for you to share these imperfections. Getting counselling is not a sign of weakness, but it is a sign of strength. Admitting that you can’t figure it out alone is a bold step in gaining breakthrough in your life. When we humble ourselves to ask for help and decide to be vulnerable we are almost always rewarded in unexpected ways.</p> <p style="line-height: 21.92px;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 21.92px;">Please feel free to contact me as I would be happy to connect with you. It would be my joy to help you live your life, and live it to the fullest.</p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>

Everyone has a special set of circumstances, or an ordeal that they either have or are trying to live through. These can take the form of one big barrier or event in our life that changes everything; or they can be small day to day things that just wear you down. I am someone willing to listen to your story. I can come alongside you to help you as you find your voice, face these challenges in your life, and grow in your confidence to overcome them.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">As an Art Therapist, I understand that sometimes words are not enough to express exactly what you are going through. I will guide you through therapeutic art making to help you find those words, find your voice, and build a stronger sense of self in the process. Don’t worry if you are not artistic, Art Therapy is for anyone from all walks of life. It is the process of self-discovery that is important, not technical skill. Art Therapy can provide a playful, non-threatening way to tackle tough problems and discover hidden strengths you may never have known you had.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">My motto in life is, “You can’t be strong for another person until you learn to be strong for yourself.” I understand too well, the need to “do it all”. The first step to finding inner strength is asking for help. This is a courageous act that does not indicate weakness, but rather an understanding that you need someone to help shoulder the burden so that you can heal and regain that strength you have always possessed.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">My training has its foundation in psychoanalysis, but utilizes a multi-faceted approach that can be adapted to your needs and preferences. Some of the approaches that can be used are Narrative Therapy, Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy, Person-Centered Therapy, Strength-Based Therapy, Family Systems Therapy, Jungian Analysis, Didactic Therapy, Dream Analysis, and Play Therapy. If you are not comfortable with Art Therapy, I offer regular Talking Therapy as well.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">My education is an Honours Bachelor of Arts Degree with a double major in Art and Psychology, and a minor in Social Work from Redeemer University College, as well as a Master’s Equivalency degree (DTATI) specializing in Art Therapy from the Toronto Art Therapy Institute. I am also a standing member of OACCPP, and CATA.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">“In the midst of difficulty lies opportunity” ~ Albert Einstein.</span></p> <br> &nbsp; </td>

People experience difficulties along their journey, but also find a way to carry on past these difficulties. I believe that as a therapist, I am given the opportunity to walk alongside people and help them access the triumphs of their past to help them overcome their present difficulties. As with any journey, self-discovery and individual growth are promises that exist through relationship. I understand that it can be difficult to speak to someone about personal difficulties and that is why I believe the work I do is a privilege, and as such I treat every individuals’ words as sacred.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been trained as a couple and family therapist, but I have also worked with many individuals. With regard to family work, I focus on adolescents and preadolescents. I know that adolescence is a confusing and hectic time in any individuals’ journey, as it is the time that independence and self-discovery are at the forefront of every decision. I have found that my work with families and adolescents has been some of the most rewarding work I have done. With regard to couple work, I focus on helping partners’ foster stronger communication. Both individuals have their separate life journeys, which they have decided to share with another person or persons. In my work with couples, I am given the opportunity to help them make their relationship function such that they can move forward on their journey together.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an&nbsp;honours&nbsp;BA in sociology, which provides me with an approach to working with my clients that goes beyond individual concerns and takes into account external forces that affect, make difficult and contribute to the self-discovery of individuals on their life journey. I am&nbsp;an&nbsp;MSc. (Masters of Science) candidate who has completed my course work in the field of couple and family therapy, and am working on my thesis, which is exploring men’s understanding and experiences of intimacy. I am a motivated and goal-oriented individual who will help you achieve your goals and help you become the person that you want to be. &nbsp;</p> <br> &nbsp; </td>

I first completed an Addiction Worker program and then went on to achieve a Master of Arts in Counselling Psychology.&nbsp;&nbsp;My background enables me to bring a broad collection of life experiences and “tools” into my work, and demonstrates that change, while not always easy and sometimes even harsh, is possible at any stage in life.&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;">Male and female adults and adolescents (16 and older).</p> <br style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;"> </td>

I believe it is how we respond to these universal experiences that shapes who we are and the direction of our lives. Trauma – no matter how it comes – keeps our brain stuck on repetitive responses and unhealthy choices. Change the response, and we change our lives!</span></p> <p>Because of the way my brain works, I can’t help but integrate the principles of faith, human behavior, brain functioning, health and biology, and family and organizational systems that I have studied. Using these principles, and helping you understand how your brain works, we can discern the patterns and responses in your life and develop better emotional coping skills so that together we can bring about new choices and power to you. </p> <p>One unique treatment approach available to you, EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) therapy, can also help your brain get unstuck from the automatic emotional responses that keep us repeating the same behaviors and block us from using new information when we have experienced trauma. This is a simple but powerful psychological exercise we do in the office together to turn on the healing processes that your brain already knows. </p> <p>RELATIONSHIPS, INTEGRATION, WHOLENESS, JOY </p> <p>These goals are possible, and my delight is helping people find the hope and courage to pursue them while providing a safe place to confront and overcome the damaging experiences that have kept us stuck.” </p> <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dr. Cathryn Harris received her B.A. in Applied Social Science and Psychology from Concordia University, Montreal, and received her M.A. in Marriage, Family and Child Therapy and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from Biola University, California. She is certified in EMDR therapy, Critical Incident Stress Management, and the Amen Method for improving brain functioning. In addition to providing outpatient psychotherapy for over 30 years in private practice, she has experience as Clinical Director for a day treatment center for the chronically mentally ill and their families, and for a faith-based outpatient counseling centre. Cathryn has supervised MFT interns for over 25 years, and will soon complete her certification as an AAMFT approved Clinical Supervisor. She loves training, teaching, and consulting, and has provided countless educational workshops and coaching to teachers, religious leaders, employers, managers and their organizations. </span></p> </td>

Life is full of ups, &nbsp;downs and challenges that we are often not prepared for. I believe it’s not how many times you get knocked down, &nbsp;but the greatest accomplishment is how many times you get up and get going and who you become while picking yourself back up. &nbsp;What happened yesterday no longer matters each new day gives you a fresh start to get back on track and to have the courage to rebuild yourself the way you desire.</p> <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Raleway, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; letter-spacing: 0.3px; background-color: #ffffff;">Marie’s goals are to be able to understand and to work with techniques that will help people heal their mind body and soul that will contribute to change their circumstances.</p> <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Raleway, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; letter-spacing: 0.3px; background-color: #ffffff;">Studies have shown that it’s not just the technique that helps people heal and change, but it’s the relationship created between the therapist and their clients. I believe this is the most important aspect in therapy. It is to build a nurturing, secure, non-judgmental healthy relationship and environment. Overall, I strive to pair specific techniques from a variety of therapeutic approaches with a specific client’s needs, empowering them to find hope, meaning, and purpose in life. I use a variety of techniques, which focus on a strong therapeutic alliance with empathy, genuineness and respect.</p> <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 14px; color: #333333; font-family: Raleway, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; letter-spacing: 0.3px; background-color: #ffffff;">“Gratitude is a form of wisdom. It is patient, loving, hopeful, and rigorously honest. It denies nothing, and it overlooks nothing. It looks reality full in the face and says: This is true, this is me, this is my situation, and I have the opportunity to build from here.
