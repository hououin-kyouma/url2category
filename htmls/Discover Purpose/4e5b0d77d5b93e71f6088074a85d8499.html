           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the heart of Rick Perlstein’s essay, “What’s the Matter with College?” seems to be the observation that college students no longer see themselves in a world apart from the rest of America, that they don’t spend these four years in a whirl of jazz, beat poetry and political activism that the masses cannot initiate but can only react to. As a senior at a large research university I can say that my experience affirms Mr. Perlstein’s suspicion. But I cannot say that this change has been a loss to the nation.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When I began that long and exhausting process known as “the college search”, I had my own visions of a bohemian paradise, of meeting peers with whom I could debate politics, philosophy and art long into the night. Oberlin College was the site of my college ideal; it was small, politically left-leaning and academically rigorous, and it had a history of racial and sexual inclusivity. It was also my father’s alma mater, and he had the same fond memories of his time there that Mr. Perlstein’s beatnik friend recounted so wistfully – for my father, college was a haven from his parents, the place where he met his oldest and best friends and the intellectual mecca where he turned his interest in Spanish literature into a passion.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Oberlin’s cost ($45,500 for tuition, room, board and fees for the school year 2007-2008, compared to $3,000 when my father attended) and its selectivity deterred me from even applying. By the time I arrived at the University of Pittsburgh, though, I had realized that I couldn’t have expected much from college even under ideal circumstances. As Mr. Perlstein suggests, my life and the lives of many college students today did not begin when we left home. I grew up in the District of Columbia, and moreover at a small, private, liberal high school. In eighth grade my classmates routinely staged impromptu musical sessions in Dupont Circle. In my senior year a good number of us walked out of classes to protest the invasion of Iraq. Granted, my high school experience is not the norm, but it is an exaggerated version of the state of high-schoolers today: Awake to political realities, to artistic possibilities – to the world in general. Schools offer a far greater variety of courses than they did 40 years ago; the Internet provides us with a glimpse of the world beyond our towns. Whatever awaited me in college could at best be more of the same; I could not expect a fundamentally different experience.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Although I had trained myself to expect little from college, I was still disappointed initially. One night several of my Honors College co-residents and I gathered in someone’s dorm and engaged in a tentative, contrived dialogue about something relatively heavy – maybe Bush, maybe Aristotle – and eventually one of us interjected excitedly, “Hey! We’re having a real college conversation!” We all laughed, straining under the weight of our desire to achieve the intellectual heights that our parents had reached in college. It did not feel like self-discovery. It felt like struggling blindly for an ideal that was no longer there.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I will never fully understand the sense of discovery and freedom Mr. Perlstein and his peers felt during their four years, but I know that college is very different today. One cause of this change is the fact that today a college degree is nearly a prerequisite for any salaried job in America, so it attracts a much greater number of students, including those who are more interested in an accounting career than in John Stuart Mill or the beauty of quantum physics. Most of the students I’ve met at college are here so they can make good money later, not to find the most obscure jazz dive.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Another cause of the change is universities’ institutionalizing the self-discovery that students used to facilitate, well, themselves. Pitt boasts an astonishing array of programs designed to expose students to art – gallery crawls, local plays, concerts, ballets – on the cheap, and offers free meals before the events and mandatory discussions afterward. Our student organizations include, of course, the Campus Democrats and the Campus Republicans, but also the Black Action Society, the Rainbow Alliance, the Campus Women’s Organization, the International Socialist Organization, the College Libertarians and a chapter of the ACLU. All these outlets for student activism receive University funding (though in drastically disparate proportions) and most routinely host events on campus (again, with free food to attract the student body). Pitt is not devoid of self-propelled activism or art but, because the University makes it easy for students to get involved in school-sanctioned activities, independent projects are marginalized.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And, partially as a result of colleges’ determination to “schedule students’ self-exploration”, as Mr. Perlstein puts it, costs have risen astronomically. Almost everyone I know at school has a job to pay for the costs that loans wouldn’t cover, and most work closer to 20 hours per week than to 10 (whereas my father, who took out a $1,000 loan to pay for Oberlin, worked 12 hours per month to earn extra spending money). It’s hard to schedule a never-ending philosophical discussion in the dorm lounge around four weekly bartending shifts and 15 credits of schoolwork. The increasing cost and necessity of a college education have created an environment in which the average student has not only less inclination but less time to pursue the “heady atmosphere of cultural and intellectual tumult” that our parents recall with such nostalgia.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In exchange, though, students have a much greater interaction with the world around them. Rather than wrapping ourselves in a cocoon of fevered separateness, we are engaging with those outside the university setting. When the cost of summer classes forced me to work as a waitress, I got to know the people who still generally do not go to college: the dishwashers who didn’t graduate from high school; the line cooks who had children in their teens; the servers who are on parole till 2015. You can’t meet, and learn from, these people in a dorm lounge. In interning for a Pittsburgh non-profit dedicated to educating the city about energy conservation, I not only learned a lot about how poverty interacts with energy use, I contributed to progress in the struggles to conserve energy and to fight poverty. No one can say anti-war protests didn’t have a significant political impact in the Vietnam era, but activism these days finds its expression in cooperation with non-profits and, yes, corporations, and it does substantial good.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Students these days acknowledge that their post-college lives will be different – less time for partying, perhaps – but they’re spending their college time in large part preparing for the future. Whatever loss this may be to us personally – and my general sense of nostalgia for the era I will never know tells me it is a big one – the nation certainly benefits. We are no longer a cultural marker for the masses; instead we work with them and on their behalf. However much the academic community has to teach the world, the world has at least as much to teach us, and venturing out of our ivory tower will benefit everyone.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Let’s create something! This is what college means to me. There has to be something to the fact that some of the most popular courses at my school are in the creative writing department, that the highest profile clubs are not concerned with politics but with the arts. In college, we’re always making things. We edit magazines, we write poetry; we choreograph and dance, we draw and paint. We do this all the time. We are nearly obsessed with building something all our own. But there is more to this: we are engaged in the manufacture of optimism.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I spent a good part of my freshman year feeling disappointed by college. As a new undergraduate, I felt a lack, for the most part, in the place of the dissent and engagement and intellectual political discourse I had so expected. I still feel this lack sometimes, especially when I consider that many of the political conversations I’ve had have taken place in classes called things like American Political Thought, and Civil Liberties. For the first few months of college, I thought that a relative absence of political change-making meant an absence of any sort of change-making at all; had I written this essay a semester ago, my conclusions here would have been much less optimistic. But now I’ve gained some distance from those first few semesters, and can look back on my experiences with all the wisdom of a nineteen-year-old college sophomore.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Some of the most informed people I met on campus I met on the editorial staff of a campus arts and features magazine. They read newspapers and countless magazines, and can discuss at length pretty much anything going on in the world or the country. They have opinions, too, and educated opinions at that; a generation ago, they might have devoted their time to protests and political outrage. Instead, the editorial staff of Greenlight will spend upwards of seventy-two hours straight on final edits alone. The magazine was founded three years ago by students, and today bases its worth on its ability to promote discussion among undergraduates. Part of what is going on, I think, is that our self-imposed units and methods of measurement of involvement have changed. Today, we don’t judge impact on explicit political action alone; we understand that a great impact can also come from creating something and sharing it with others.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As much as we might see the American experience as increasingly fractured, college can never be anything but an incredibly collective experience. In college, everyone is learning about something, and everyone is learning together and all at once. We spend half our days studying literature or history or engineering, half our days immersed in thought in class. But the greatest thing about college is that we are not content to stop at the consumption of the ideas of others presented to us by our professors; we want to make something ourselves. We are directing short films, we are writing plays. Every college student has a handful of friends they would consider artistic. But in delegating all creative responsibility to our supposedly, apparently quirkier friends, we’re selling ourselves short. This is not to say that my school doesn’t have its fair share of future investment bankers who and I stereotype heavily, here still cite their perfect SAT scores in proclaiming their self worth. But I would still be hard pressed to name any friend, any acquaintance at my school who was never involved in the creation of something new. In college, it’s the creating, it’s the making that won’t stop.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In this way, the undergraduate experience itself is a metaphor. Those of us who attend college will invariably graduate, or at least leave school; the rest of our lives will be at least partially defined by the consumption of information passed on to us by others, by newspapers, by politicians. What college teaches us to do is to hear, to learn, but then to expand. What I hope for myself and others is that when we graduate from college, we will move beyond our undergraduate experiences but continue, over and over again, to look around us, to connect with others, and then to build something together. It’s impossible, too, to write off the powerful currency that is the sharing of things we ourselves have created or more simply enjoyed. For many, there is no happier conversation than the sharing of books or movies or music we love. To bring this truth much closer to the undergraduate experience, in college we are forever talking about something we or a friend of ours has create d. We share what we love, and we share enthusiasm; in doing so, we band together towards the creation of more new things. As long as college continues to be a great arena for creating and sharing and enjoying, it will continue to be essential in its role in the generation of new ideas.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Most of us in college now, myself included, grew up and came of age in an era of broken things and people and politics. This is no different from any other time, really Americans base their history on tragedies and triumphs, and not much in between but what is different now is that on campuses protest and public dissent seem less of a constant, less of a defining feature. I am troubled by the political disconnect, even the apathy I sometimes see among my fellow students. I don’t quite know what to say to those who miss the constant demonstrations on campus quads in the names of various causes, much less those who worry about poor turnout among student-aged voters.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But I am also troubled by the suggestion that college campuses have withdrawn from making any sort of change, or from being any sort of definite force in the national consciousness. All around me, I see students working: to make something new, towards forging new modes of self-expression. It is just that their methods are often less direct than they perhaps used to be. Where one generation might have protested, or spoken out in some similar way against the actions of the government, we instead want to build something new in the place of what has been torn down or destroyed. Today, it seems, to create something new and positive and beautiful and maybe even apolitical can be just as subversive. To choose artistic creation over dissent is itself a political choice.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I hope that we’ll someday try directness; someday, of course, we’ll have to. But to return to the optimism being created on campuses every day and all the time: maybe by optimism, I mean something a little more like a confidence in our own abilities to build our future. In college, we practice making things to share with others; we practice making things to better our collective experience. At least a few of the generation in college right now will someday have a hand in running the country. What we’ll bring with us is a willingness, a desire to make something newer and greater: politically, socially, culturally. Even better, we’ll bring with us a knowledge of the joy of creating something together as we hurtle forward, onward, and hopefully upward.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I am in college now, so there is a low probability that I was born in the 1960’s. Each decade is remembered by particular traits. Along with the psychedelic movement and funky age, the 1960’s was known for youthful radicalism. Obviously in many decades that have come by, the “bone of contention in elections have differed.” I do not think it is peculiar this time around.” Maybe the college experience is less critical to the nation than it was a generation ago. I believe the factors leading to these changes are natural and not a deliberate action. The issue of terrorism, the phenomenon of celebrities and probably the internet are some natural causes.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The internet is a wild jungle. One of my lecturers referred to the situation as ‘anarchy.’ Young people now get much vital information in any form from the internet. The wide belief is that unlimited access can only come good. But when people can actually study online and many institutions have more online libraries than real books, it limits the idea of ‘college life’ experienced a generation ago among budding.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Celebrities absolutely rule the world. Youths are bombarded with the wild thoughts of taking pictures alongside their famous celebrities and sports personality. Youths (who are quite an impressionable) hear stories of very wealthy business men who dropped out of college to pursue successful careers. Examples from all works of life include Kanye West, who attempts to mock the idea of college as incompetent. He creatively uses the names of his albums to play down the importance of college in our society.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When people hear the story of Bill Gates, they strive to be like him, and since he did drop out of Harvard University, it serves as an incentive to further push away the importance of college.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Activities like recent terrorist attacks on the nation have taken the nation over. These days, news stations predict what is potentially going to happen in the world of terrorist attacks. The focus of the nation moves from college to terrorist fear.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">These three are big main answers, and I strongly belief these factors are to blame for this part of the era.</p>

            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Absolutely, the college experience is less important than it was a generation ago, but conversely the experience you gain from college is indispensable when one leaves college for the work force. Quite simply, the college experience as our parents knew it has become obsolete. As Perlstein hints, the internet has replaced college as the main way to find out about “taboo” subjects. College students don’t need to go to college anymore to expand their cultural awareness–they can do so in their bedrooms at a lower cost (after all, surfing the Net doesn’t cost one thousands of dollars a semester). The “generation gap” as the boomers define it, has also changed. A generation ago, your parents were your parents; they saw their job as parenting, disciplining, and the like. Thus, this provided ample ground for generation gap confrontations. You went to college, and experienced things your parents didn’t let you see, do things your parents didn’t let you do. But somewhere along the line parents stopped being parents–they became friends, providers. When you have been provided for, your every whim indulged, why rebel against your parents. Our generation doesn’t hate our parents, and we don’t want to; our generation doesn’t want to rebel. We’re busy wrapped up in our own little lives, which have been cultivated by our parents. The idea of rebellion is foreign, mostly because it would involve leaving a security bubble that many of our generation have existed in since they were born.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The whole purpose of college has changed as well. College has merely become the next in a long line of processing plants for you to enter the workforce. Before, you left high school, and discovered yourself, your passions, at college. College was where you found out what you wanted to do in life. Now, many of the present generation have been on a set path before high school. In middle school you start on a path to being a doctor, or biologist, or whatever–you take the appropriate classes in high school, which function as a test run for similar classes in college. College now essentially serves as the final stage for students, the place where the unrefined meat of the student body is created into neat little societal sausages. As Perlstein suggests, college no longer suggests a break with pre-collegiate life, only a slightly different version of present life. College has become just another faceless bureaucracy in a long line of faceless bureaucracies. The world is quite literally turning into the movie Brazil, or Pink Floyd’s The Wall, where one really is “just another brick in the wall.”</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Another reason for college changing is that the world we live in has undergone immense changes since the heyday of the 1960’s. Our generation has a war, but unlike Vietnam, there’s no draft to make Iraq an intimate threat to us. You have the choice to serve, or not to serve. If you choose not to, you can keep the threat of war distant and tucked away while you comfortably watch “Grey’s Anatomy” in your dorm room. Many of the great civil rights questions have been answered. Whites interacting with blacks, women in the workforce–these are no longer shocking things, but in many places, the norm. That is not to say there aren’t still problems–there are, but not to the point of the country literally tearing itself apart over such problems. In short, we grew up in a world that is the byproduct of the boomers, for better or worse. For us, things have always been this way, and presumably always shall be. We’re young, and we have no attachment to a time before our own because, unlike the boomers, we weren’t around to experience it. To the boomers the 1960s represents the cornerstone of their legacy, along with getting Erectile Dysfunction and adult diaper ads on primetime TV. To us, its ancient history, no more familiar or relevant than World War II and the Great Depression were to our parents.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This essentially boils the problem down–the boomers don’t understand why we don’t pick up their mantle and “really do something,” or that our generation has a lack of activism. The paradigm facing the older generation is that they made fighting the establishment into the establishment. We’re rebelling, in a sense, by not doing what our parents did, because there was a time for it, and the time has passed. In our cushy little lives, what do we have to rebel against? Boomers have yet to figure out that time has moved on and that they have become obsolete, mostly by their own doing. Civil rights and women’s rights were, and still are tremendous achievements. But nearly everything else the boomers did has affected us in slight less positive ways, and changed the way we think. The boomers initiated the sexual revolution and gave us AIDS and genital herpes. The boomers became money hungry in the 1980s and created the mass market media culture that they now decry has sucked the will out our generation. Drugs are no longer totally taboo, and we have many more in our time than there were a generation ago. In rewriting the rules to fit their own agenda’s, they’ve tried to, ironically, do what they fought against–conform our generation to their views.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thus our generation approaches college in a wholly different light. We’re not going to college to learn, we’re going to create a career. College equals a higher paying job, if countless statistics and survey’s are to be believed. The country has changed from a manufacturing base a generation ago where one could do reasonably well without a college education, into a job market increasingly based on higher education. In short, we (i.e. my generation) want stuff. And the only way to get stuff is with money. And in order to get money, the prevailing wisdom is that one goes to college and from there lands a well paying job.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In closing, the older generation decry’s the change in college from a generation ago. It is arguable that it is of their own doing. Selfish, self-centered boomers begat selfish, self-centered kids. The boomers created the materialistic society we call home, yet are perplexed that we aren’t rebelling against it. In a sense the boomers forever changed their landscape, and are now reaping the benefits and harms. College has changed because boomers changed it–and their kids are merely adapting to an environment that is not of their own making. We do have a political and social consciousness, but we too often limit ourselves to thinking in our own little spheres of comfort and tempering it with hollow materialism. Perhaps saying that there is no generation gap is wrong–it’s just different, and perhaps we realize it, but our parents don’t.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I graduated this June from one of the largest schools in the country, The Ohio State University. I sat, sweltering in the midday sun, slowly burning in the shape of my mortarboard cap as the ceremony dragged on for three hours. Finally, cranky and dehydrated, my class peers and I were herded to grab our degrees and hustled out of the stadium. I had never seen my entire class in one place together and the number of people was unbelievable. Ten thousand people, all receiving their degrees on the same day. And I had to ask myself, why were we all here? What is so important about this piece of paper that was placed in my hands by a very rushed Dean of Humanities?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I was told that college would be the greatest experience of my life. I would be free to choose my own path and I would find out exactly who I was. But on campus, it didn’t seem as though the student body was working too hard on discovering itself. Those who wanted to continue to graduate school were far too focused on their grades and contacts to do much else. The rest of my peers seemed to be only working towards that piece of paper, and usually for their parents, or simply because they knew that nowadays, it is an absolute necessity.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the past, not everyone went to college. It was the best and brightest that made their way to the hallowed grounds of higher learning. Today however, everyone is told they must go, or else risk lifelong poverty in a menial job. The intense pressure to get into college is only matched by the intense pressure felt by those who realize later that their bachelor’s will mean little in their chosen fields. A bachelor’s degree, which once meant a great achievement, today is as absolutely necessary as a high school degree. Or so we’re told.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In truth, no one absolutely needs a bachelor’s degree to live. In fact, some of the most successful people in their fields today may not have one. The internet and the rise of computer technology has opened an entire field to people with drive who don’t need a degree, only personal motivation. So why does America’s youth flock in mass droves to college every autumn?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In my own experience, I find that college today has become a business, and a highly profitable one at that. Beginning in high school, the average student pays to take the standardized tests required by admissions, if not classes and books to prepare. Then come the onslaught of application fees, entrance fees and tuition, which even at state schools continues to rise higher and higher. And finally, there is the price of books, which in and of itself smacks of racketeering. As a student, I was relieved when my textbooks were only $300 per quarter, and lucky when I was able to sell them back for a quarter of their original worth. Imagine my surprise when I went to the bookstore and was told that my books had no value. How could a book have no value?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But since everyone is told they must go to college, it becomes easier to raise prices on everything associated with it. My generation’s desperation to attain their degree means that they will pay rapidly rising tuition, even at state schools which were created so that all could afford a college education. When colleges raise their selectivity and standards (often code for raising their tuition), they become the means to chain those who are told they need them. Students sign on for decades of debt for a degree that many couldn’t care less about.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So when people ask what is wrong with this generation, its lack of idealism and motivation to change the world, all I can answer is that we are too deep in debt to care as much as we should. I am one of the luckier ones that managed to earn a scholarship to pay for my tuition, but still ended up with a chunk of debt that will take years to pay off. And when I head to grad school in the future, I will have a debt that will dog me for a long part of my adult life. But in my chosen field, I have been told that I will need a master’s degree just to gain a foothold in the job market, as a bachelor’s just isn’t what it used to be.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It’s not that college is less important than it was twenty or thirty years ago. College will always be a place where people are exposed to new experiences and discover what they want to do in life. But when college becomes about grades, test scores and just slogging through towards a piece of paper, it loses its original meaning. College should not be a debt factory, pushing undergrads through to a life of monthly statements for a massive loan. Despite my disappointment in my own undergraduate experience, I still feel that college is an important part of young adulthood that should be open to everyone. But the pressure put upon high schoolers, as early as their freshman year, must be stopped. People should choose to go to college, not be coerced. And it is essential that college remain accessible to those who choose to go, particularly in financial terms.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When I walked out of Ohio Stadium as a new graduate, I admit I was clutching my degree like a life preserver. And I proudly display it where I know everyone will see it (on top of the television, as I feared it would wrinkle in the bathroom). Maybe it’s too soon since my own time as an undergrad to have completely made up my mind how I feel about that leather bound piece of paper. But I still encourage my younger sister to look into college, despite her teenage nonchalance. Though my time at the university was not what I expected, I received an excellent education that will remain with me for the rest of my life. I just hope that my sister will be able to avoid the pitfall of debt that so many of us graduates seem to find ourselves as we emerge into our new lives.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Look into the offices of the baby boomer crowd and see past the neatly pressed suits, ties, and Botox injections; look into the time when their days were spent fighting the powers that be. Pressing the boundary of known independence not for the gratification of being the rebel without a cause but the satisfaction of being apart of a movement. Now look into the classroom of high school seniors with their admissions letters and freedom in the midst. Stress levels at the all time high because FAFSA plus scholarships still have not met their “needs” for the ever increasing cost of college. Blame it on the rap music, MTV, BET, VHI, and video games for the lack of activism from the college students. Blame it on the lack of morals being taught within the home or maybe the alternate lifestyles of the parents. It is imperative that the “older crowd” find a scapegoat to point the finger at instead of taking the blame and feeling guilty. Could this notion be the answer to all of life’s problems? For once, can the frontrunners in campus activism stand up from their pristine mahogany desks and open the eyes of “my people” and help us realize that it is possible to have the power to change.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I have never been denied the right to go to the school of my choice nor have I been told that this opportunity is not fit for my sex. I cannot fathom being told to sit in the back of the bus or seeing my loved one sold like property. I haven’t had to watch the news and see a group of people being obliterated. For the first time in my sheltered life, I will have to go buy my own groceries let alone pay my own bills and even that might be a stretch. I stand firm when I say, now is the time for change. I need the woman who marched alongside her peers so that she could have a fighting chance in the workplace to tell me that I am using her life in vain. I need that man from Atlanta, Georgia whose “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” was scrutinized in my AP English class to tell me that I have turned his dream into a nightmare. The only problem is they can’t. Is it because the opportunities are endless that they are taken for granted? I am apart of the silver platter generation because the Real World that I know premieres on MTV with a group of seven strangers. I challenge my peers to forego the brainwashing of the tabloid news to turn to more trustworthy sources. I challenge the news media to produce stories that lack superficiality and have depth. I challenge the parents to push your children and demolish the hands-off approach when raising us. The college that the 1960’s student knew hasn’t gone far. It is shielded from our eyes because the issues aren’t addressed.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Campuses are priding themselves on exclusivity and competitiveness. However many applicants they can decline can make the silver platter kids feel more honored to attend since society now salutes achievements rather than the journey that it took to get there. Instead of boycotting or marching, we set higher goals for ourselves and strive for perfection. Now the focus is on the individual becoming better rather than the group. We took one extreme and took it to the other end of the spectrum. Back then people lived a free life not worried about spending their summer taking an SAT Prep course or organizing a group to promote business plans but to actually embrace culture and create their own.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Natasha Denson, a graduate student in the Prairie View A&amp;M College of Nursing doesn’t spend her days organizing a peace effort for third world countries who cannot receive quality medicine not because she doesn’t care but because she doesn’t have time to embrace her career endeavors without a professional mindset. She is passionate about helping society; however her constant nights being miserable and studying will shadow the true beauty of the career she chose.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Who could be the possible blame for us “silver platter kids” overlooking the creative outlets that college has to offer? Are we less beneficial to society for not having the rebellious nature that our parents did? Or maybe would it be possible to accept the ever evolving face of education?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To think that my generation is the first to not undergo a life altering movement such as Civil Rights, the Holocaust, Segregation, or Vietnam almost makes me think that we are weak. Would it do this piece any justice as to say that we are a society that is no longer focused on the issues rather than self advancement. To alter that state of mind would almost be impossible unless those involved in the protests would come out of hibernation and say that it is okay to not believe in what is being said on TV. Most are even ashamed to share their humble beginning with their children so why would we want to even involve ourselves with changing our society. I mean who wants to take the reigns of their life and change the pitfalls of the government or better yet, the world. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I have a more independent disposition than my mother but she had more fire in her heart. Music had meaning and the news had purpose. People were respectable and children had manners. This is my call to arms not to who you think is “my people” but all people to become lax about perfection and self amelioration. Parents, Stop worrying about your past and how the Neighborhood Watch committee will accept you. Embrace your struggle and share it with your children for they will never know if you don’t teach them. Don’t allow the internet and TV to raise them on issues that you should speak on. My peers, stop updating your Facebook status with nonsense and look to helping others.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What’s the matter with college? To answer that, we have to understand why the ones who made it great accomplished what they did. They were not feeble minded and scared. They tested standards. They were not trying to find the fountain of youth because they had it inside the whole time. Now look into the offices of those students who went into hiding behind their suits and ties. Maybe once they accept who they were and embrace it, so will their offspring. College as it was known is still there, it will just take that one heart full of fire to break the standards and the right struggle to bring it back to the forefront..</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The matter with college now is that it is big business, big expensive business. Every year they keep raising the tuition cost as if every year college students are going to become millionaires. Well I have been in college for three year and I’m still not a millionaire. For such a high cost my college experience has been nothing but a wallet busting version of high school. You still have the test and the papers and the teachers who either don’t know what they are doing or need to retire, but now that you’re in college you get to have a huge loan attached to your name when you graduate or should I say if you graduate.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The college institution has been alive and kicking for many years. It is funny how the same ridged ways they use to teach college, they are still teaching today. I believe that the outside world has changed so much that some of that change should be reflected in the standard college class room.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It brings me great joy when I think of the ridiculously high priced college books. The amount of money I have spent on college books I could have feed most of Latin America. As if to insult you further students are given a fraction of the text book cost if they decided to sell the book back to the school. Many of my fellow students have decided to keep their books instead.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Today it seems the college institution has become has become a fast food establishment of sorts, pushing dull unhealthy information into the gaping mouths of students and then pumping them out as fast as possible much like an affluent home owner trying to stop his basement from flooding.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Maybe when the U.S. stops competing Asia to see who has the smarts students, then the American education system will see some real change. I mean the kind change where one does not have to go to an Art college to be creative or allowed to think outside of the box.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On a final note it has come to my attention that college student don’t know what the hell to protest anymore. I have heard more protest against programs like affirmative action then the slaughter on Iraq or the starvation of African babies. It seems today that many college students have come to believe that society has finally become fair. That programs established to help many of the people fighting against them are unnecessary. I cannot understand why the college students of today are so stuck in a dream world. Why are students more concerned about keeping a minority from getting his or her entrance spot than trying to keep their fellow military students alive or trying to stop the world from becoming one giant disease infested pool party (reference to global warming for the clueless).</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Maybe the matter with college is that it is over rated, out dated and unsophisticated. Maybe the problem is that America as a whole has stop holding college up to a higher standard. Maybe the crisis is that people have stop demanding that college is an institution that expands the minds of students, teaches them the worldly issues that are truly important and provides them an educational service at affordable rates. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Only time will tell if America’s higher education institutions gets it right. Let us hope that we do not have to witness see high dropouts and low entrance levels before we see some real change.</p>

            <address class="byline author vcard"></address> 
           </header> 
           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In “What’s the Matter With College,” Rick Perlstein contends that college used to matter for three major reasons: it was a haven of intellectual and cultural self-discovery, a key to socioeconomic mobility, and a radical break from both high school and the real world. Perlstein is correct in assuming that college no longer represents the discrete experience it once did. However, he does not account for the fact that it no longer should. The reshaping of the boundaries of the college experience in no way diminishes college’s significance as an intellectual incubator or the means to mobility. College still matters: if anything, it matters more today.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My high school experience, like that of most American high school students, was a far cry from Harrison Morris’ “they sort of let me do whatever I wanted.” Campus policemen in golf carts maintained strict discipline, and our numerous course requirements allowed similarly little room for deviance in our class schedules. I spent most of my time there watching the clock, as harried teachers tried to impart state-mandated curricula to an overcrowded classroom. Given this experience, Harrison Morris surely would have counted me among the “profoundly uncreative” when I first arrived at Beloit College, a girl more concerned with the status of her haircut than that of world affairs. Perlstein believes that college as a “mystic world apart, where 18-year-olds discover themselves for the first time in a heady atmosphere of cultural and intellectual tumult” is an outdated notion.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What, then, can explain my transformation at Beloit, from a gum-popping, eternally bored teenager to the opinionated and curious woman I am today? Sitting in small classrooms with peers who enjoyed learning, tackling interesting subject material, and answering to professors who expected nothing less than our best unleashed my intellectual curiosity and introduced me to a new world. Colleges that change lives are far from extinct.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Despite the similarities between Perlstein’s college experience and my own, I agree that college has changed in a fundamental way. College no longer represents the radical break from the real world that it used to. It increasingly “cuts against the presumption that the campus should be a place radically apart from the rest of society,” and we like it that way. Is this necessarily a negative? Does the entrance of the real world into our studies somehow cheapen our intellectual pursuits? I argue that it does nothing but enhance them. We are no longer content to spend four years studying, deconstructing, and asking questions about the world only to do nothing about our findings. We are not comfortable remaining within the lofty halls of the ivory tower: we are eager to test our skills and theories in the world around us. Our desire to do so makes sense in context. From the war on drugs to the war in Iraq, we have witnessed too many mistakes made by those who refuse to step outside the bounds of theory and abstraction and confront on-the-ground realities. Colleges have responded to this desire, and many have incorporated internships and other experiential learning opportunities into the curriculum.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Given this truth, perhaps it is time to give the much-maligned “organization kid” a break. Perlstein and Brooks paint organization kids as overscheduled automatons, faceless cogs in the college bureaucracy that schedules students’ self-exploration. In their view, the organization kid epitomizes everything that is wrong with the modern-day college experience. Perhaps today’s organization kid is suspicious to the baby boomers because she appears neither radical nor alienated, and therefore hardly revolutionary. But please don’t let her exterior fool you.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The baby boomer generation is now the establishment. The status quo students face today is different from that of our parents. Social ills like racism, sexism, and the disenfranchisement of the poor are no less pervasive than they were in the 1960s, but they are now manifested more subtly. As our society evolves, so must our methods of promoting social change. Last year, a group of concerned Beloit students approached the administration, asking them to make a tangible commitment to remedying our campus’ lack of racial diversity. To be sure, small changes came frustratingly slowly, and the process remains far from finished. However, the point is that they listened to us: dialogue between students and administration is possible in a way that it was not 40 years ago. Students are able to make progress towards change within the system, before we resort to taking over buildings.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I am an organization kid, replete with the impressive credentials. I make no attempt to hide that my ultimate aim is to become a cog in the great American bureaucracy, for it is that bureaucracy that holds the power in our society. Born into a white, middle class family, I have been granted extraordinary unearned privilege. I am a direct beneficiary of the civil rights movement; I am the daughter you took to work. I am aware of the great debt I owe society. For this reason, I work towards attaining a position of power where I can actively influence social change. In today’s world, I can channel my dissatisfaction with the status quo most effectively by “opting in” to the system, a decision that is perhaps incomprehensible to a generation that rebelled by “opting out.”</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">During the last weeks of our senior year, members of our Sociology class complained that we were sick of the college’s hypocrisy, the slow pace of bureaucratic change, and the sense of confinement on a small campus we had grown eager to escape. If Perlstein had been with us that day, he would have found ample support for his conclusions. Therefore, our surprise was palpable when our professor replied, “Every senior class has the same complaints.” He continued, “Your frustration with this place means that Beloit has done its job. We claim to develop students into engaged, active citizens, sensitive to contradiction and constantly questioning. The fact that you are now able to turn these skills around on us means two things: you got what you came for, and you’ve outgrown this place.” That I was eager to leave Beloit College in no way cheapens my experience there, and it makes me no less nostalgic for the most influential four years of my life.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yeah, I’d say college still matters.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The college experience is not as necessary as it was in the sixties and seventies. Society has changed and we have changed with it. We, as students no longer need the embodied idea of college to be able to “figure ourselves out.”</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Because of this, students are no longer molding colleges. Colleges are molding students. College is, essentially, a means to a career. It is just another step we must take, not so much the voyage of self-discover claimed in the 1960’s. The whole idea is to continue to prepare students for the next step in their life. In high school, we are prepared for college. College…internships. Internships…assistant job. Assistant job…associate job. Associate job…etc. Reagan has seemed to have gotten his social-mobility community, sans the “noisy, dissident minority” (for that dissident minority is no longer present at every school, only represented at a dissident minority of schools). Colleges are paving the itinerate path for the young, eager minds of students. But why on earth, you may wonder, would students allow this to happen?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It’s because you don’t have to discuss your ideas with other people. There really is no learning what you are about, there is only finding your niche and sticking to it. And how do you do that? The media will tell you, no need to put in any effort. Want to support Bush? You’re Fox news. Want to oppose Bush? You’re CBS news. Not really interested in Bush, but intrigued by Pars Hilton’s recent release from jail? WB11 news. Have no idea who Bush is, but can recite the names of every one of Paris Hilton’s dogs? E! “news.” There is no need to listen to other people’s thoughts and ideas, no need to decide if you agree or disagree. All you have to do to find a friend is match your category. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“What news channel do you watch?”</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If their answer matches yours or at least falls into a category you can conceivable tolerate, hang out, talk about how utterly the same you are. No match? Walk away, this person will only offer opposition (not growth!). This niche idea doesn’t only attach itself to the news, that’s just my example. TV, music, people, everything has a genre, everything is categorized.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Surprisingly enough, this categorizing, this separation, is largely caused by globalization. Everyone can talk to everyone who can talk to everyone. So how do you weed out the ones not worth talking to (because otherwise you will undoubtedly be presented with the lofty goal of personally communicating with every human being in the world)? You find your niche. And in you’re niche you live.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the “old days,” for college students anyway, your niche was your college. Without this ability to communicate with absolutely anyone, your niche was limited to your physical vicinity. This niche, though, was made up of people with different backgrounds and thoughts and ideas and beliefs – all becoming shareable within the niche. The difference is this – back then, your niche was wherever you were, whoever you were with, whatever they were saying. Your niche was physical. Today, your niche is more or less intellectual. Why bother talking to the person who lives in the dorm room next to you when you can talk to people who already “know you,” already “get you” on your little wired-up PC. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is, of course, not true for everyone. There are always exceptions. Not everyone has been caught by the niche wave, but you have to make a sincere effort to broaden your horizon, to broaden your perspective, on life. Some people do this by going abroad. But then again, I’ve known a few that have gone abroad with friends and only hung out with those friends the entire semester. Same niche, just a change of scenery.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Now it may be obvious that I may not think this intellectual niche business is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but I’m not completely knocking it. After all, I am a product of the intellectual niche society. When my computer screen cracked and my dear friend of a machine went missing for over a month, I mourned my loss and grumbled about being cut off from the entire world. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There are, in fact, positives to this trend. With these technologies, you have more options. Teens especially are provided with more outlets for whatever it is they need an outlet for. You have more options. But with these options, people tend to limit themselves. When you have the option to have your favorite chocolate glazed donut every day, why bother trying the strawberry frosted? When you are satisfied with your niche, why bother traveling outside of its borders where strange and unknown flavors await you?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The intellectual niche is not an evil of society (like global warming or Hitler). It’s just an inevitable consequence of an ever-changing society. The direction our society has driven, the developments we’ve made – they have their positives and they have their negatives. Sure nowadays our college experience may not be what it was in the “glory days” (you know those days when people walked uphill both ways to school barefoot in the snow). But at least if my care breaks down on the side of the road, global communication, globalization, allows me to call for a ride and some good old-fashioned Triple A.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As I said, society has changed, and we have changed with it. I may never have the ideal 1960’s college experience. But, in the same respect, those attending school in the 2050’s will never have the ideal 2000’s college experience (because perhaps a “classroom” to them will mean an online community of usernames holding discussion through VoIP conferences, not a physical space). And people like myself will sit around grumbling about the glory days. You know, back when college was college.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As colleges and universities nationwide train the future All-Stars of the American workforce, today’s society witnesses a kind of intense academic focus to which past generations were unaccustomed. Rick Perlstein’s article “What’s the Matter With College?” ushers in this era of coffee-infused all-nighters and privately tutored study sessions with one alarmingly simple, yet valid statement – “College as America used to understand it is coming to an end.”</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Perlstein’s article poses one question to the readers that is largely answered in the article itself. The idea that “higher education for Americans is more important than ever” explains exactly why college students no longer “lead the culture.” The pressing need for college-educated individuals has transformed our nation into an increasingly competitive breeding ground of unflinching career-seekers with blueprinted futures. Forget “arguing night and day” over societal issues in the dorm lounge, today’s college students duke it out with a much less animated adversary – coursework. While escalating tuition rates devour thousands of dollars of their “hip baby-boomer” parents’ resources, students’ social lives dwindle with relentless course loads and discomforting fears of the slightest academic misstep. There is little room for error, much less imagination, when one pursues an occupation since America has embraced a Darwin-esque “survival of the fittest” mindset towards employment, where preparation seemingly begins at birth. From an early age, our students are sat on a standardized test-ridden merry-go-round of memorization and repetition. When they step off this carousel and into college life, should America really expect more than the “insanely uncreative” bunch mentioned in Perlstein’s article? Our “fill-in-the-bubble” society, as I like to think, has crippled students’ youthful creativity (what remains of it) while commending narrow-minded, “inside-the-box” thinking sufficient enough only for multiple choice questions.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Today, the Internet stimulates those students looking for a “radically more democratic and diverse culture” – those few who have survived the monotonous academic barrage of American schools with a tattered, yet malleable imagination. The World Wide Web satisfies a vast contingent of would-be “revolutionaries” reminiscent of the 1960’s and 1970’s, providing a safe-haven for all to preach their words via websites, podcasts, blogs, even videos. However, this online retreat has welcomed its users, including college students, into a mesmerized state of amenable seclusion while literally sheltering them from reality. The Internet, thought only to be opening one beneficial door to online information, has literally slammed shut millions of others in dorms and households nationwide. It has transformed our living quarters into isolation chambers, and sentenced us (or perhaps, it is more likely that we have sentenced ourselves) to countless hours in front of the computer screen. The tool intended to expand our thoughts works simultaneously to contain them, and with a tinge of irony channels our fresh ideas back into the receptive online community, enfeebling our chances of any impact on the outside world. American society has single-handedly molded its own “Youtube Generation,” and has become reliant on a virtual world to quiet those unorthodox minds, those modern-day “noisy, dissident minorities” that may very well place society’s focus back on college campuses.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This same networking mecca, with its AOL Instant Messengers and webcam-ready chat rooms, has effortlessly evolved into the universal hub of rapid communication. Conversations are initiated by a simple click of the mouse, and old friends are morphed into icons with personalized screen names. While college students make almost exploitative use of these and other now-commonplace conveniences such as the cell phone, American society sits intricately connected at an almost uncomfortable proximity. Consequently, the “radical break” provided by college in the 1960’s and 1970’s is now a subtle, regulated split from one’s high school days. The era of the Sunday “obligatory 30 second phone call on the dorm phone” to the parents has given way to the full-time job of incessant text messaging and daily checkup dials to friends at home. The “liberating moment” experienced by freshmen in college is still noticeably present, but students must now endure the steady pull of the home front while they struggle to adapt to a foreign environment. Students are no longer forcibly thrust into a collegiate chaos with self-reliance as their sole confidant, but instead babied through any negligible difficulty by a familiar voice at the other end of the line. Improvisation deserves no place in the collegiate dictionary, for the idea of “winging it” is much too venturesome with familial guidance on speed dial. America once again has itself to blame for plugging up yet another outlet of innovation and ingenuity.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">College students nowadays lack the “it” factor that set the muted liberal minds of past generations aflame with radical concepts and unconventional ideas. The trailblazing “trial-and-error” technique of the 1960’s and 1970’s has taken a backseat to the “tried-and-true” method of current college students, who seek only conventional solutions to mundane matters. Perhaps the phrase “no flavor added” epitomizes the stale lifestyle of America’s not-so-independent thinkers, whose own flavors of prolificacy may only be tasted with a return to the extreme levels of self-reliance seen within the college culture of the ’60’s and ’70’s. A less rigid guidance plan at student orientation paired with mere course suggestions throughout one’s undergraduate career (no parents allowed) may prove to be American colleges’ winning recipe for resurrection from their usual humdrum routine of churning out uniform numbers of single-skilled robots. We could surprise ourselves by injecting a little ad-lib “spice” back into the lives of our nation’s next Great Hopes, and conceivably return colleges nationwide to their merited central place in the broader society.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As a supplement to my own and Mr. Perlstein’s findings, I offer these words of advice: Blur the implacably focused minds of our college students for a minute and turn the magnifying glass on America in its entirety. Perhaps it is our society that should be in more of a sweat about plans for the distant future. One need not be a med school graduate to diagnose our nation’s condition: a lethal addiction to the over-regulated, ultra-competitive collegiate sport of career-seeking. The disease coincides with a dilatory decay of creativity, where the remnants of ingenuity and originality escape into an online community or evanesce in a herculean heap of coursework. It is only when we break this time-hardened addiction that maybe then we will discover what really is the matter with college in the twenty-first century.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the sense that Rick Perlstien discusses why college life and college students are an increasingly inconsequential bunch of people to the direction of the nation, its politics and its culture, he is absolutely correct. As a current university student, I cannot dispute his allegations and this should be no<br> surprise. It is important however, that we all understand the reasons for this change between the generations. I believe there are three overarching explinations for this; first, we live in an increasingly isolated society, second, college is no longer a unique experience, and third, the out of control costs of a<br> university education. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The “organization students” which Mr. Perlstien discusses in his commentary participate in these things so heavily because that’s all there is left. The college experience which he describes has become diluted beyond recognition by isolated and often dysfunctional suburban kids playing endless video games,<br> watching Comedy Central twelve hours a day and drinking to get “wasted.” While this is obviously not universally true, it has so clearly taken over Perlstien’s idyllic description, that in order to find that intellectual conversation, that spontaneous creativity, those like Perlstien must search out these experiences in these all-consuming student groups. This is of course a product of our increasingly isolated society, which is arguably a product of the first generation that grew up largely in the suburbs, and a result of new web services of our generation such as MySpace, Facebook, AIM, and more. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Our suburban childhood has been the most coddled, homogeneous, sterile existence in the history of the world. The type of homogeneous isolated environments college students of our generation come from are so void of creative inspiration, and human interactions that students from these backgrounds<br> often cannot relate that well to other people, how to have fun with others, or just have fun with intellectual conversation. This lack of creativity and coddled isolation is helped along by policies and infrastructure that require our kids to be bussed door to door less than half a mile to their school, that<br> create placeless streets and single standard existence across the 48 contiguous states. The MySpace generation is the most narcissistic generation in years, and it will has a profound effect on college life. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The tools of the most recent Time “person of the year,” MySpace, Facebook, YouTube and AIM, serve to further isolate students from human interaction with eachother, and the society at large and are largely void of “spontaneous creativity.” Students are now spending hours of their day on these sites writing about their most recent social gossip, or self pontificating, or IM’ing eachother, or checking away messages during that non-class time that so defined the life of a college student in Mr. Perlstien’s time. Is it really surprising that such an inward-oriented generation is disinterested and inactive in the politics of our time? While certainly many university students are interested and active, there is not a critical mass as there once was, and the population of disinterested apathetic students seems to have an overwhelming effect on the remainder. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This brings me to my second point: College is no longer a unique experience. In the most practical sense, an undergraduate education is required for our generation to function in society, and Masters degrees are increasingly required for decent paying jobs in many industries. Often, students are pushed<br> into college whether they are ready or interested or absolutely not, simply because it’s the only route leading to benefits, faster promotions, and the elusive “American dream.” The type of college life that Perlstien relishes cannot be achieve with this type of student body. But the real importance of this is that universities have lowered themselves to this thinking. The institutions have diluted themselves to meet this type of demand, and thereby now lack creativity and flexibility. Many, if not dare I say most<br> programs of colleges and universities are set up as training sites to churn out mindless soldiers for all sectors of our economy. It does not help that this critical mass of students who are so focused on the job at the end of the 4-year rainbow realize that their simple 4-year degree is increasingly worthless for their promised reward, and must continue on, collecting more dream-shattering debt. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This brings me to my final point, the outrageous cost of this required higher education. During my parent’s years in college, the late 60’s and early 70’s, four years of college cost the equivalent of a tiny portion of his father’s annual income, yet now one year at his alma matter is about $46,000. Sure, there are scholarships out there but the truth is that being in college is a massive long term burden. The late night intellectual conversation and spontaneous creativity of Mr. Perlstien simply cannot be a part of the<br> experience of those who have to work every waking hour of their college existence outside of class to limit the dramatic effects such long term debt will have on their future. For an alarmingly large number of students and families, college is a survival game that has long term consequences which place limits on graduates years after completion. </p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Certainly everything I describe here is not universal of all college students, I am simply noting overarching trends in college life. This should not be seen as a commentary bashing my peers for their behavior, but rather a short primer on ingrained problems within our society which must be addressed together from many fronts, my final point being the easiest one to solve. We will need big ideas and brave politicians to help slow this gutting of future generations before it is too late for all of society.</p>

            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Education is the path from cocky ignorance to miserable uncertainty”<br> <i>-Mark Twain</i></p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">College! The word in itself represents a platonic ideal of success. And therein lies the problem.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Through freshman and sophomore and junior years of high school, I worked hard sometimes because I enjoyed the work but often because I had to do the work. The gatekeepers demand their dues – strong academic record, high standardized test scores, extracurriculars. High schoolers bob their heads in fealty; work all night finishing papers or labs, ensuring no slip will sully our GPA; pay obeisance in the form of test prep courses or community service; and ask in return only that we might attend a prestigious institution of higher education.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Admissions officers with titles like “input control specialist” process applications, sort the grain from the chaff, wielding enormous power to crush the hopes of anxious teenagers with the click of a mouse button. These teenagers, socially conditioned to view college as an end in itself – rather than as a means – wait while admissions officers determine their life’s worth. Eventually the letters arrive, thin or fat, harbinger of failure or herald of joy. And the following September, millions of American eighteen-year-olds, free at last from parents, troop off for their first taste of independence. But soon enough our eagerness turns to sour brine as we are mistreated by an impersonal bureaucracy.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Within a year or two, the motivating force for most is no longer “education” but rather “paying off loans” or “not disappointing my parents” or “having fun before I shuffle off into the drudgery of the real world.” Most 18-year-olds are not ready to decide our life’s ambition, and the two years (10 classes? 11?) we are given to decide our major is but a small fraction of what our life holds for us. It is absurd to ask a (hormonal, sex-addled, lonely, bewildered) teenager what she is doing with her life, and no less absurd to expect her to discover it in such a brief span. Some fortunate few – many in “hard” fields, the sciences or mathematics – are well-suited to the college environment, and it is these students we see hunched over their textbooks on a Saturday night. Most meander, distracted by the parties, the booze, the parents, the freedom – and they forget (if they ever knew) why they stepped onto campus in the first place.<br> Information overload in this modern age devalues learning – Wikipedia substitutes for real research, as students feel too busy to delve into a dusty book and prefer the easy accessibility of the internet. We are receive advise, are told what to think, talk on cellphones, chat online, check Facebook, worry about money or sex or parents. We have no time to breathe and recognize our good fortune. And so we do not.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">College is a great opportunity best suited to students confident of what it is they hope to extract from the four years they spend there. College is opportunity – and yet all too many of us let that opportunity turn to mediocrity because at 18 we have not the experience to take advantage of it. Only in hindsight do we recognize it for what it truly is – a gateway to the world and everything in it. Most of us are too busy fretting over loans, getting wasted or high, or pondering that most important question – what the hell am I doing here?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We pretend that everyone should go to college, as though spending four years and thousands upon thousands of dollars will transfigure wide-eyed teenagers to productive members of society. College should be open to all ready and willing to pour sweat and tears into making the most of it. That kind of dedication is not present in most teenagers. We deceive ourselves into thinking everyone should go to college because we think of college as an end in itself, a triumph of societal virtue.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">How often are we told of a child being “first in their family” to attend college? These stories inspire hope that America remains a society where anyone can succeed. But how many of those children, whose parents toiled to give them that opportunity, go to college and vanish into the bureaucratic apparatus, which aims to emboss knowledge upon puerile youth’s blank slate? The act of attending a university is not enough – what really matters is what we take from the experience, what it prepares us to do, how it changes our ideas about the world and enables us to bring those ideas to fruition. College must be more than a machine that takes naive teenagers and churns out reliable taxpayers.<br> Many should go to college – not at 18 or 19, but at 21 or 25 or 30, after they mature enough to take their studies seriously (some will be ready at 18, but not most). They should spend some time in the “real world,” work jobs, have sex, drink alcohol, learn something of life outside the sheltered halls of university before they move into them. To get the most out of the experience, students should be ready to ask tough questions of professors, poke holes in theories, take intellectual responsibility in a way that demands both self-confidence and the ability to take a chance, to be wrong, to look the fool. College should be about honesty – not just about knowing, about collecting facts, but about knowing what we don’t know and understanding how to turn facts into wisdom.<br> The omnipresent, sprawling bureaucracy that administrates the modern university bears a share of the blame. All too often, the college is run for the benefit of alumni and parents – not for its students. It’s all about the money – wheedling as much of it away from alumni and parents as possible while funding student activities that cast the university in a good light and hiding those which do not match its image away in basements or closets. Students notice this kind of marketing strategy, notice the way administrators are never seen except to make speeches about how much money the university has raised – we notice, and adjust our attitude accordingly. If nobody cares about us, why should we care about the school?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Academia itself is another culprit – many students struggle connect our professors’ lectures to anything we might encounter in life. Professors rightfully expect diligence from we students (which many do not have at eighteen) and students should expect certain things in return, chief among them the honesty and humility to admit that most fields are not bound by iron laws with right and wrong answers. Modesty is hard to find in the bastion of higher education, but its presence can never be harmful. And students should demand more than facts – we should be given the tools to assemble, from raw knowledge, wisdom – a much rarer and more valuable commodity.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">College should teach us how to think – should break down cocky ignorance and teach us to question not only the world around us but also ourselves. It should not be inaccessible to anyone for economic reasons – but it should be closed to those unready to accept its challenge. And if I graduate miserable, I should be miserable for all the things I have not learned, not because I foolishly double-majored in French Literature and Anthropology and can’t find a job to pay off $100,000 in student loans.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">College as America used to understand it is coming to an end. Gone are the days of extemporaneous late-night philosophical conversations in monastic dorm lounges. Instead, colleges these days are brimming with kids who, rather than asking the fundamental questions of humanity, obsess about how they are going to fit into the economy after graduation. This is the sordid state of college in America nowadays. According to Rick Perlstein, anyway. But does his depiction reflect reality? Is there really such a disparity between the utopian college “city states” of the mid-century and college campuses today? I think not.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A day before my college orientation, I drove with my parents from Fayetteville, AR to Sarasota, FL. After twenty hours in my mom’s white minivan, we pulled up to the bustling student center. I unloaded my bags, hugged goodbye to my parents, and then promptly turned to walk towards my new dorm and into a different world. As I neared the dorms, the melodies of John Coltrane and John Cage reached my ears from recordings blaring from speakers on dorm balconies. Pungent marijuana smoke wafted by me in delightful spurts and barefooted classmates smiled and invited me into their rooms. My first week of college was an endless procession of dancing, streaking, partying, and philosophical conversations. Quite utopian.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The partying has subsided over the past two years, but the philosophical conversations have augmented in quality and quantity. I participate in ongoing discussions with my friends that run the intellectual gamut: the efficacy of democracy, the role of women in Roman society, the life patterns of sea hairs in Sarasota bay. Perhaps, then, my experience is not so different from Mr. Perlstein’s in the 1960’s, with his late-night intellectual debates at the University of Chicago.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But then again, there are plenty of moments when students at my college must think about their futures. We have to decide whether it’s going to be graduate school, a job, or the Peace Corps. We have to think about money and paying off loans. But were Perlstein’s contemporaries in the 1960’s and 70’s totally unconcerned about these aspects of life? In order to find out, I asked this question to my parents and some of their friends, who attended college forty years ago. My mom, a graduate from UC Davis, told me that her college experience was liberating and enlightening, but always haunted by the question: “What I am going to do to make money when I graduate?” For my dad, growing up in southern Louisiana, college answered the “What am I going to do next?” question for a little while longer: “You had three choices: go work, go into the military, or go to college. But even if you went to college, it was geared towards what you were going to do afterwards.” I’ve received similar responses from the others I interviewed.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Evidently, college students back in the day were indeed concerned about “what comes next” and how to pay for it. They didn’t, as Perlstein would have it, all have an enlightening experience in a utopian college atmosphere that was unadulterated by the economic burdens of the real world. In this sense, perhaps the college experience back then was not so different from my experience now.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Rather than adopting Perlstein’s stark juxtaposition between college as it used to be and what it is today, I think we are better off highlighting the similarities: students have always liked to learn stuff and discuss ideas, yet are justifiably concerned about quotidian issues like having enough money to pay for expenses. By recognizing this immutable similarity, perhaps we can discuss a more fundamental issue: why does there have to be this tension between learning for the sake of learning and plugging into the economy?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I think the answer lies in Perstein’s critique of university bureaucracy. Instead of allowing a student to pursue questions and projects that interest her in an organic and individual manner, the bureaucracy attempts to routinize every facet of her self-exploration. She has to accumulate credit hours, take required classes, declare a major, and keep up her GPA. We’ve come to think that the only way to succeed in life is to display the acceptable numbers and check off the appropriate boxes. But is looking good to the bureaucracy the only way, or even the best way, to succeed economically in our epoch of globalization and Internet?</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Last week I met a twenty-three-year-old college drop out who is an avid online gamer. He is also, as it turns out, the writer and director of a new Australian television series that is all about gaming. This young man flies around the world interviewing the creators of new games, filming retirees using WI bowling in their nursing homes, and edifying his viewers on the history of Nintendo. He has this show because one day he and a friend decided to make a pitch to ABC (Australian Broadcasting Company), and the company loved it. Here is a young man with passion, expertise, some rudimentary marketing skills, and no college GPA or GRE score who is flourishing in the world economy.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But this is not meant to undermine the importance of college. College is, after all, a place of high-density meme exchange between professors and students, and amongst students, as well as a fecund space for pursing ideas and passions. Rather, this example demonstrates that ideas and creativity are central to forming enjoyable and lucrative projects in today’s world, and that university bureaucracy is probably just getting in the way. Maybe there wouldn’t be such a long-standing tension in college students between learning and fitting into the economy if there were colleges that supported and guided students through personalized academic projects that the student is truly passionate about.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Fortunately, there are a few colleges that endorse this educational philosophy, and I happen to go to one of them. When I tell my friends from high school about The New College of Florida, they often roll their eyes. Invariably, they’ll ask: “So, is it really true that you don’t have grades? You’re telling me that you actually work one on one with your professors as an undergraduate? They really give you page-long evaluations of your work? Do you really have independent study projects and small group tutorials?” And the answer, to their bemusement, is always “yes.” Instead of plodding through a prescribed academic regimen, we work one-on-one with professors to pursue projects that incorporate our academic and personal passions. Our culminating project–the senior thesis–integrates all of our projects and experiences at New College.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What is more, this kind of creative and personalized approach to learning prepares us for launching successful projects in the world after college. Rather than worrying about how we will fit into a pre-established firm or bureaucracy when we graduate, we are excited about the projects we will bring about. I know I am, anyway.</p>

           <div class="entry-content"> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">By the time I had finally mailed off my final application, I held such a passionate disdain for the general realm of college admissions that I almost felt bitter towards my acceptance letters. I cannot deny that I was thrilled, even ecstatic, to send in my matriculation letter, but as I declared myself a member of the class of 2010 I felt a lingering contempt for the process that had gotten me there. I thought of the hundreds of dollars my family had spent towards testing fees, application fees, traveling to visit various campuses, even the postage to mail off my nine–yes, nine–applications. It all felt like a waste.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And then, I got to college.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What a difference. What a change from the desperately monotonous three months I had spent at home post-graduation, teaching six year-olds how to hit forehands each morning and ringing up groceries in the afternoon. During my orientation I found myself surrounded by over 700 students my age, all of whom seemed eager to socialize and expose themselves to new ideas, new people–really, a new lifestyle.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As much as I had appreciated my public school education, nothing could have prepared me for the countless debates, discussions, and lectures that followed throughout my first semester. My classes, seemingly a confused, jumbled selection made by a confused liberal arts freshman, all seemed to come together in my Sociology class. As my professor pushed us to dissect the likes of Marx, DuBois, Durkheim, and Mills, I began to make connections between the African Diaspora and DuBois’ passionate prose, or Virginia Woolf’s distressed realizations in A Room of One’s Own. I could not only feel that I was learning when I stayed up through the night writing essays or argued for my interpretation of a passage in class, but even as I walked across the quad to lunch, and became instinctively aware of the crunch of a leaf under my sneaker: I felt stimulated, both intellectually and socially, in ways I had never experienced in my rural Vermont hometown.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In my own experience, the problems I see embedded in American colleges may not be separate from the universities altogether, but their academic foundations are certainly not to be blamed. Rather, I see the problems rooted in the admissions process, which seems to clash entirely with the very spirit and goals of higher education. While the essence and lure of American colleges is freedom of expression, of thought, of social life, and exposure and access to these newfound freedoms, the new nature of admissions seems to be centered on strict guidelines and acquired advantages, such as ability to pay for and attend SAT classes, that are available primarily through access to money–a trend mirrored by rising tuition fees.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The admissions essay epitomizes these restrictions. A high school senior eager to pour out her heart about a service trip to Guatemala or to honor a grandfather may be told that it’s “too cliché” and that they’d be better off to write about something else–something more obscure. “Try to make the admissions reader learn something about you.” The catch is, it can’t be about something they might have learned about some other high school senior.<br> I became disillusioned with my own essay somewhere around the fifth draft, when my brother told me I should rework my entire conclusion. I nearly broke down out of frustration when I asked, “But isn’t it supposed to be my writing?” I had to stop before comments about “Word choice” and “Evoke more emotion” completely concealed the ink and made my work an unrecognizable amalgamation of edits from my parents, my siblings, my college counselor aunt, a number of teachers, and so on. I gave up and sent it in.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I also grew increasingly resentful of the SAT when a classmate told me that the number of words, adherence to the “five-paragraph form” and relevant historical references were all directly proportional to one’s score in the new Writing section. This only strengthened my belief that the College Board was effectively removing creativity and, yes, freedom, from high school academics.<br> My Advanced Placement Physics class senior year, for example, had been called Honors Physics when my brother had taken it before increased competition had forced our high school to designate five AP courses. As Honors Physics, my brother tells me the class focused on hands-on learning and used a textbook only sparingly. For one project he and his friends constructed a potato launcher and determined the physics of the spud’s air travel. In my AP class, with the same imaginative instructor, the course depended on a prescribed textbook to determine the topics for daily lectures and exams. I was lucky to pass the class as a dispirited second-semester senior, but not before I used two pages of the essay section in the AP test to write a letter to the College Board, citing my dissatisfaction with the changes they had forced high schools to make in order to “compete.”</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On this point I agree with Mr. Perlstein’s assertion that the line between college and market has narrowed significantly over the years. But from my personal experience, I maintain that colleges–or more specifically, college professors and students–still provide an environment in which students are invited to explore the new. One of the most influential college professors I have had implored us, his students in a James Baldwin course, to take advantage of the fact that while in college, “you are the most free you will ever be.” His tone was almost desperate; his motivation genuine. If colleges today have lost their “centrality,” as Mr. Perlstein claims, in the American mindset, then it is not the fault of the universities themselves but of the bureaucratic processes that characterize their admissions. Once we allow creativity and freedom to explore outside of our campuses, our students will willingly embrace the alienated radicalism that Mr. Perlstein so yearns for.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ironically, though, in my own college essay I wrote about my nostalgia for years I hadn’t been alive for, and pined for the freedom of rebellion I imagined in my parents’ teenage years throughout the sixties and seventies. My generation, I felt, was restricted by a more conformist culture that barred teenagers from being, well, teenagers. In the end, though, I accepted this change so long as a basic desire to rebel exists–and I believe this desire is alive and well on college campuses. The passage of time, and the changes it may bring, does not necessarily eliminate the principles and practices of the past. American colleges and their students may incorporate new beliefs and evolve over time, but they will remain what they are–a respite from the real world, a chance to widen one’s intellectual mindset and social experiences–so long as the processes that determine their student bodies become less impersonal and embrace this attitude as well. However, I do believe it is the student’s responsibility to take advantage of the freedom offered on college campuses, and to extend the tradition of radicalism behind his or her parents’ hazy memories. Hell, you’re in college! You’re as free as you’ll ever be.</p>

            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There are a lot of dead birds in Hyde Park. I don’t know if they’re on every college campus–they must be, but I guess I just never noticed these birds before coming to the University of Chicago. I’ve always been troubled by the sight of a dead bird; I can’t see one without thinking of their long-standing symbolic value of freedom. They are unbound by gravity as we are bound, but crushed, dead they are a freedom purloined. This removal of freedom is a starting point for the transformation of the college experience from the 1960s. College cannot be what it once was; the collectivity of the college lifestyle has disintegrated to a singular experience in which it has become impossible to care outside of oneself. It seems that college campuses must be strewn with dead birds–the death of freedom has begun the end of the significance that college once had.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">College in the ’60s meant freedom: no parents, a liberal environment, ability to vote, cigarettes, marijuana, and of course, alcohol–all of this deluged upon the coming-of-age college freshman. However, now this latter piece of the freedom is gone. One can no longer enter into college being able to drink alcohol. This sounds petty, yes, but in the quest to preserve the archetypical college experience, students seek to drink, which is not a very difficult task. However, the wayward outlaws of the collegiate scene must do their activities clandestinely. Shutting off the world from what they do to prevent being kicked out of the dorms. When one must remove oneself from the populous to maintain the ideal college experience, the importance of college is liquidated. College becomes a singular experience, a separation from everyone.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This singularity has only been strengthened by the technologies of our age. Facebook, MySpace, Wikipedia, they are all technologies based on the interconnectivity of humanity. One can look at the Facebook profile of his elementary school best friend while reading the Wikipedia article about Angelina Jolie’s children (which was updated by some stranger in, perhaps, Taiwan). All of this while he sits comfortably, in his pajamas, in his dorm room, in another city, in another world. In the singular access to these interconnected technologies, the collective is abject; the physicality of anything has been rejected and replaced with ones and zeros. It becomes apparent that connectivity is a form of false collectivity. And this is dangerous; to live singularly with the thought that life is in any way collective (when it is only synthetically connective) we begin slouching towards Bethlehem. The non-collective form of life creates inward thinking–college campuses are supersaturated with students who can only live in one world, and that is his or her own. As for the University of Chicago, and other institutions of its caliber, this problem is only made worse by every student living inside of his or her head, thinking only about theories and big problems for four years. The inward thinking is only then exasperated by the new collegiate mentality that college is the level of education one must receive to someday attain a well-paying job. Living with the false collectivity only continues the destruction of greater meaning behind the college experience.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Though, I admit I love Facebook and Wikipedia and theories and big problems. They are not the only causes of the death of collectivity. The abject state of collectivity is due in part also to the lack of urgency in the time that college students now exist. The draft for the Vietnam War is over, the murders of students on the Kent State campus is too long ago, and there is nothing in our time that is akin to these. Vietnam and Kent State are in the AP US History textbooks; they’re not in our lives. Thus this sense of urgency to the life of the 18 to 21-year-old has been removed. Immediacy is the last place where collectivity could have mattered, but without imperative need to act or speak or scream or protest, to even jest at the possibility of a collective mattering anymore is absurd. The only urgent event in our day comes from Virginia Tech. That is to say this horrible event, created by the isolation and excessive singularity of an individual, is the only thing left to fear. Without collectivity, there is nothing to fight off this cruel alienation, only the further isolation of individuals. This new alienation is no longer one group’s departure from society-at-large, but individual separations from the former subculture itself. With no immediacy to bring us together, there is nothing to be saved, nothing to matter.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The individual experience has extrapolated out the ability to care. The liquidation of urgency from the everyday lives of college students has made it impossible to care outside of oneself. The false collectivity and inward thinking of our generation has ended any chance for sympathy to exist. W.E.B. Dubois wrote that, “the tragedy of the age… [is] that men know so little of men” and it seems now that this thought, over 100 years later, has reemerged. Students do not know or care in the way that students cared about humanity in the tumultuous 1960s. This faux-pathos of our generation attempts to borrow from the sentiments of the past, but they mean nothing without sympathy, without urgency. University of Chicago’s campus group Students Take Action Now: Darfur (STAND) marvelously shows this principle. Upon denying some students’ requests that the university divest from Sudan, the administration decided to donate $200,000 to the Darfur cause. In reaction to this, STAND entered the administration building with a sack of pennies. When denied access to the office of the administrator to whom they wished to speak, one member of the group poured the sack of pennies onto a secretary’s desk saying, “This is what we think about their $200,000.” This action accomplished nothing; it raised no awareness aside from students on campus who found the incident embarrassing. STAND knows nothing about the people of Darfur. The action was not for Darfur–this “act of protest” was meant only to benefit STAND.</p> 
            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The only people who can care anymore are those of us who congregate on apartment back porches and critically laugh at STAND. We are the back porch dwellers who drink and smoke and ponder these problems on late night ventures of the mind, and then write essays for the New York Times in some hope that we could change the world or, at least, think about it. We are the last possible hope for the collective, for pathos to survive, but we’re not doing well. Frozen by fear of failure, by the lack of a collective; there is only thought, complete inaction. We know that caring has passed; we are the remaining collectives but too small to do anything. There are too many birds collapsing from the sky. Freedom, collectivity, sympathy for humanity have died. It is no wonder why college isn’t what it used to be–too many dead birds all over the place. Our human race can only achieve happiness if love reaches its conclusion, and each of us finds his loved one and restores his original nature. -Aristophanes (via Plato)</p>
