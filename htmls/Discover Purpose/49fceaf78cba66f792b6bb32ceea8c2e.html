          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>You probably never meant for it to happen. It’s not as if you went looking for a lover.</p> 
          <p>However, once you fell in love with another person than your spouse, things got rather intense. You’re already in what some refer to as an emotional affair. Perhaps you’ve gone further and the relationship has turned physical.</p> 
          <h3>HOW DID IT HAPPEN?</h3> 
          <p>It may be difficult for you to know exactly how you got into this situation. Some are honest enough with themselves that they know step-by-step how everything came to be as it is now. Others have more difficulty, their mind confused because what they are doing is so contrary to what they believe and value. Some feel that God sent them their <a href="http://www.marriagehelper.com/soul_mate.php" target="_blank">soul mate</a>. Others blame it on their spouse’s actions or lack of actions.</p> 
          <p>Underlying vulnerabilities very likely made the new relationship possible. Highly revered marriage researcher John Gottman writes in his book <em>The Marriage Clinic</em>:</p>
          <div class="7XFu9D3P" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;">
           <center>
            <a href="http://your.marriagehelper.com/marriage-workshop"><img src="http://www.marriagehelper.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ad1v3.jpg"></a>
           </center>
          </div> 
          <blockquote>
           <p>…many clinicians…have been quick to point out that ‘affairs involve sex, but sex is usually not the purpose of the affair’…In fact, most clinicians who have written in this area report that affairs are usually about seeking friendship, support, understanding, and validation…they are about getting the acceptance that is missing in the marriage.”</p>
          </blockquote> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>&nbsp;</p> 
          <p>My work with thousands of couples in crisis indicates that this is exactly the case. Relationship affairs – as opposed to the one-night-stand type of affairs that are wholly about sex and not at all about relationship – usually find root in a person’s feeling unloved, unaccepted, disliked, or disrespected. That doesn’t mean that the person necessarily went looking for affirmation and validation from someone else. However, when it came, it captured his/her&nbsp;heart.</p> 
          <p>Maybe you describe this new relationship similar to the way others I’ve worked with:</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>“I’ve never been loved like this.”</li> 
           <li>“No one understands me as well as he/she does.”</li> 
           <li>“This is the person I was meant to be with.”</li> 
           <li>“I can’t explain how this feels because I don’t think anyone else can understand it. It’s intense. Amazing. Wonderful.”</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>Most likely your desire is not to hurt the person you’re married to, but rather to live in this new level of love that you never knew existed. You don’t mean to harm family, friends, coworkers, church buddies, or anyone else. Your desire is to have, not to hurt. (There may be an exception to that if you feel that your spouse has been unkind or hurtful. If so, that degree of negativity toward your spouse probably increased its intensity after your affair began.)</p> 
          <h3>WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?</h3> 
          <p>You have four potential paths before you:</p> 
          <p><strong>1.</strong> Stay in your marriage while continuing a relationship with your lover,</p> 
          <p><strong>2.</strong> leave your marriage for your lover,</p> 
          <p><strong>3.</strong> end the affair yourself,</p> 
          <p><strong>4.</strong> or your lover ends it.</p> 
          <p>Each possibility carries consequences. Short-term consequences and long-term consequences. If you choose short-term, you may decide to end your marriage for your lover. The intensity of your present emotions may make that the choice that seems most likely to make you happy. However, there are long-term consequences that will come with that choice. Consequences involving your family, your children, your friends, your religion, your personal beliefs and values, and your spouse. If you think that being with your lover more than makes up for any difficulties in these areas, you aren’t alone. Nearly everyone who makes that decision figures that because of the deep love they now feel, everything balances out in the end.</p> 
          <p>Unfortunately, it rarely, if ever, turns out that way.</p> 
          <p>Your emotions are intense now, but they won’t be forever. Within a couple years, if not before, you’ll discover that the Cinderella or Price Charming you’re in love with isn’t quite as wonderful as you think. In the ecstasy of new love people overlook flaws, quirks, and problems in the other. When that emotions evolves, as it must and will, you’ll start to be bothered by things that never bothered you before. You will discover that Cinderella and Prince Charming exist only in fairy tales. All the rest of us are flawed and at times hard to live with.</p> 
          <p>Repeatedly those who left their spouses for a remarkable love come to me after a few years and say they wish they could do it all over again. This time they wouldn’t abandon their marriage but would figure a way to work out their problems. They would&nbsp;not&nbsp;expect their children NOT to be negatively affected by the divorce. They would look deeper into their hearts to see that their beliefs and values are part of their very identity and realize that to live in contradiction to them would lead them to become someone quite different than they were. They would admit that there is never a “happily ever after” and that leaving one relationship for another is trading one set of problems for another.</p> 
          <p>In short, they would have stayed in the first marriage and done all they could to make it work.</p> 
          <h3>MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION</h3> 
          <p>Though logic doesn’t reign for you at this moment, please attempt to silence your emotions temporarily&nbsp;to see past the feelings into your future. What do you honestly, at the deepest level of your being, expect it to be ten years from now if you abandon your marriage, maybe destroy another in the process (if your lover is married as well), and violate your core beliefs?</p> 
          <p>Happiness?</p> 
          <p>Based on my observations of and work with thousands of people, I can tell you from a purely logical, statistical, vantage point, that it is extremely unlikely.</p>

              <p>Ed, </p> 
              <p>We understand your situation because we see it everyday at Marriage Helper. As you have probably already discovered, you’re in a tough spot because I’m guessing your belief and value system is telling you to stay with your spouse while you intense emotions (we know this as Limerence) are trying to convince you this woman is the best decision.</p> 
              <p>My advice is to give us a call at 866.903.0990 and let us talk to you about it. And if possible, we would love to see you and your wife at one of our workshops for marriages in crisis. You can find more information under ‘Marriage Help’ on our main menu. </p> 
              <p>In the next couple of weeks we will also have a great video series that Joe put together for spouses in your situation. It will be extremely valuable in your decision making process. Let us know how else we can help!</p>

              <p>Ed, I understand the intense emotion that you feel for this woman. I also know how in nearly every case these situations turn out. You indicated you have a great deal of passion for the new woman and I don’t doubt that you do. However, it will not last in the same form it is now. It never does. Passion always fades. When it does, people look around and wonder what happened…how they gave up so much for this new relationship that seemed to be the ideal…and how that beautiful dream evolved into a nightmare.</p> 
              <p>More than 20 years experience working with couples tells me that if you pursue this new woman and lose your wife of fifteen years, you will come to regret it. Actually, regret isn’t a strong enough word. Think of it like this…take all the passion your fee for the new woman now and multiply it by a factor of ten but in a negative direction. In other words, if you lose your marriage to this new intense emotion, the result will be a much stronger emotion of sadness, regret, wishing you hadn’t done it, and longing for the life you could have had.</p>

                  <p>I am in the same situation. I’m separated from my wife of 8 yrs and our marriage has been rocky for years. I met this girl who is 18 yrs younger than me and I am starting to fall for her. I know that me and my wife can work this out but we have seperated so much and I’m tired of it and want to either make it work or let it go and go on with my life and be with this girl. the new girl has a lot of energy and goals and dreams and knows what she wants. my wife who is the same age as me just wants to do nothing more with her life but just live mediocre and that’s it. I’m not like that and want more and so does this girl. my wife has contacted her ex bf and I just found out last week. she contacted him in the past and and seems to not let him go. she claims to never go back to her past but I see otherwise and I’m tired of it. I’m just afraid of starting over again and afraid that If I leave for good o might regret the future I would have with my wife.</p>

              <p>Don’t do it !!! Talk to your wife and maybe you can work it out together . 15 years is a very long time . You guys both have to work at it . If you have a physical connection with this women you will ruin your family and make yourself more confuse . Nothing not good forever you will come across other problems with this other women once you really get to know her . You were once in love with your wife and probably still love her but not in love . Give your family a chance . Cut ties with that woman and focus on your family and exercise maybe join a gym with your wife find the spark that was once there . If you are ready to fully go . Think about this are you ready to see your wife with someone else loving her and your kids .</p>

              <p>Hi…I am married 15years now.two daughters.about 4 years ago my husband cheated.I took it very bad at that time and gave him.n change again. Everything went well but I think about it every day. The last 1year I became very talkitive to a friend of my husband that knows about the affair my husband had as he was there the night I confronted the women.we started to call each other as I bought propery from him and chated very nicely. The last 3 weeks we called.each other more often with the excusd of talking about the property. We decided to meet last Thursday just for.a coffee. But he kissed me and I kissed back aboy 3 times.I walked away cause I dont believe in cheating as it hurts so much. But I cant stop thinking about him and think I have not felt like this for.such a long time.. after I left he called me to ask if.I can turn around and he want more of.me. I told him that the kiss just drove me more md but I never returned. I live abiut 400km away but work close by every 2 week. I play the kissing over and over in my head. What should I do? My husband on the other hand I can see is trying to change but there are still so much lies from.his side.and he.makes empty promises..and brake them every month or second month.what should I.do</p>

              <p>Chesca, a man who continues to live with his ex-wife for ten years isn’t likely to leave her at all. You say you have a strong bond – and I do not doubt you feel that – but how strong is his bond to you if he continues to see you only in secret and keeps living with another woman.</p> 
              <p>I’m not saying he’s a bad man…I don’t have a clue who he is and likely never met him…but this man has two women and that isn’t a good thing. He gets something from her or he wouldn’t be there. He gets something from you or he wouldn’t continue the secret relationship.</p> 
              <p>If you continue in this relationship, you’ll most likely wake up some day to discover you’ve wasted years that you could have had with a man who wants only you.</p>

            <p>I have worked with my coworker for 12 years and I have been married for 11 yrs to my husband. Out of those 12 yrs my coworker and i have had a relationship for 5 yrs. The problem is that I have fallen in love with my coworker. We have been through it all together. But my husband is the perfect man and has not done anything wrong. I’m so confused because I don’t know who to choose.</p>

              <p>Jane, I have asked Joe to give you some feedback on this post. I’ll put it up here and notify you when he’s done that. Something that I would offer – think about your belief and value system. If your belief and value system says that your marriage commitment it important and that you would not want to break this commitment that you made before God, friends and family, then your choice is clear. We understand that acting on that belief and value system is easier said than done. If you would like us to help (without judgement), feel free to give us a call at 866.903.0990</p>

              <p>Jane,</p> 
              <p>One of the hardest, yet most crucial, aspects of life we learn is that you sometimes have to let go of one thing to have another. </p> 
              <p>If you continue as you are now, you run the risk of losing both men. I’ve seen it happen so many times…a person waffles, wanting one while married to another. Things like that can go on for a while but eventually some little error brings it all to light and then things get bad quickly. If a part of you thinks that would make things easier because if your husband divorced you, you could be with your coworker, think again. So many, many times I’ve seen that scenario played out. And so many times I’ve seen the paramour walk away when his/her lover finally became available in every way. You see, it’s one thing to be “in love” when that requires little to no commitment and altogether another when one faces the knowledge that he is the cause of a marriage ending. That guilt can quickly erode the positive emotions. Also, having a few years of relationship that was clandestine carries its own sort of intrigue that immediately ceases when the other person gets divorced. In short, those “dream” relationships very often evaporate under the clear light of day when a family falls apart.</p> 
              <p>I urge you to make a life choice consistent with who you really are – consistent with what you believe and value. You say your husband is “perfect” and hasn’t done anything wrong. You made a commitment when you married this man and, as you point out, he doesn’t deserve to be cheated on…either emotionally or sexually.</p> 
              <p>Save yourself future pain by doing the right thing now. If we can help, we will gladly do so.</p>

              <p>Josh, </p> 
              <p>My heart breaks for you. The situation you describe is much more than I can address here in a few short paragraphs. </p> 
              <p>As you know, your situation is bad. However, it is not necessarily hopeless. Is there anyone that your wife respects who is willing to intervene and ask her to consider saving her marriage. If so, please ask them to do so. Then find a very, very good counselor that your wife will trust and the two of you can work with. If your wife is willing to make only a brief effort and will not commit to seeing a therapist, consider our Marriage Helper 911 workshop. It isn’t the “be all end all” that will automatically save your marriage, but our statistics are very good. </p> 
              <p>One other thing that may be of great help to you is the video I recently did helping spouses such as you understand what is happening in your wife’s mind and heart as she is in this affair. You can find it here <a href="http://bit.ly/1l0rpNT" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/1l0rpNT</a></p> 
              <p>If you are a religious man, I suggest you pray intently. </p> 
              <p>Finally, be strong. Don’t whine, beg, or plead. Nothing about that makes you attractive. Make it clear you wish to save your marriage, but don’t demonstrate panic or fear. Be the man she fell in love with.</p>

            <p>I have been married for 5 1/2 yrs but with my husband for 10 yrs. He was divorced with 2 kids. We had twins together. Right before we married he had an affair. I believe it happened before. I lost that “prince charming” feeling. Then I became a slave in the house and overworked with 2 jobs to keep up with his child support and alimony. He was very selfish. I met someone 2 years ago. The man I met has had drug, alcohol and legal issues in the past, but I fell for him HARD and can’t seem to break it off. I am a caretaker. But I fell for the man inside of the mess. My husband is the opposite but has clingy issues and we never agree on things. I know if i leave him I will end up with a mess. But why can’t i end this long term love affair???</p>

              <p>Donna,</p> 
              <p>You state that you are a “caretaker.” That can be a good thing. It also can be a bad thing, as you already know. When your husband had the affair you stayed because you still saw primarily the good in him – what you call the “Prince Charming” feeling. When it became clear that he is selfish and that you had to take care of all the housework and hold two jobs just so he could pay alimony, you allowed that to occur. When you met the new man, you see the troubles of his past and say that you cannot break it off because of your caretaker nature. </p> 
              <p>It doesn’t take a psychologist to see that you, Donna, very likely would benefit from learning how to love and respect yourself. If you WANT to hold two jobs to help out a man you love, that’s fine. But you seem to indicate that you don’t want two jobs, that you feel as if you are a slave, and that you resent your husband’s selfishness.</p> 
              <p>No wonder you fell “hard” for the new man. Yet, you say that the reason you cannot break it off with him is because you feel a need to take care of him. It seems that you suspect that your major attraction to the new man is not just to find freedom from what you have, but perhaps another chance to rescue another troubled man. </p> 
              <p>Actually, both of those motivations will work against you in the long run. </p> 
              <p>First, if you went with the new man just to escape the husband, you may well wake up one day to realize that you weren’t so much drawn to the new man for who or what he is, but for what he represented to you. Freedom. BUT, you already sense that his past struggles may not mean freedom at all. It may be that you move from the proverbial frying pan into the fire. </p> 
              <p>Second, if you move into another relationship or marriage because of your need to take care of someone, you aren’t looking to find fulfillment in who you are but in what you do. It almost seems as if you need to prove your worthiness or your right to be loved by having someone who needs you to take care of them. If you continue in that vein, your life is likely going to be one miserable relationship after another.</p> 
              <p>If you want to learn to love well, and to be loved in a way that brings true happiness, learn first to love yourself. You don’t have to be a caretaker or prove your value to be lovable. </p> 
              <p>Therefore, rather than moving to the “mess” you say will come if you leave your current husband for the other man, find the help to focus on your own well being that exists whether there is someone for you to take care of or not. When you learn to love you, you very likely will stand up to your current selfish husband and be strong enough to stop working two jobs and no longer be a slave to support his selfishness. </p> 
              <p>You already know his weaknesses and strengths. You see mostly the good in the new man, yet your statements indicate that there is a nagging in the back of your brain that being with him would present another set of problems that may be worse than what you have now. Rather than hoping the new relationship will help you find happiness, I strongly urge you to move away from that man – yes, I know it will be difficult and that you are so much needing affirmation that you would feel great pain if you stop seeing him – and find the help to get you where you need to be with yourself.</p> 
              <p>Though I am not a prophet, I fear that if you continue with the new lover, your self-esteem and need to feel loved for who you are rather than what you do will become even a greater problem and happiness will elude you for years to come.</p> 
              <p>When you find the way to love yourself – truly love you in a good way – you can then do what it takes to make your current marriage be what it should be.</p>

            <p>I married young, and we are almost to year five. Recently, another woman has captured my heart. Right now, the latter relationship is platonic; flirtatious at most. But it may be headed toward more. I do not want to violate my marriage vows/divorce. On the other hand, I want children and my wife, at bottom, does not. This other woman does, and just today we looked longingly together at another happy family.</p>

              <p>Tom,</p> 
              <p>Wanting children and having a wife who doesn’t is a major problem. If you do not find a way to resolve that, the underlying resentment can (and usually does) build to a level that can destroy a relationship and leave each person bitter. Therefore, I understand that as a conflict of massive proportions if it isn’t solved.</p> 
              <p>However, unless I’m badly mistaken, that isn’t the reason you wish to leave your wife – at least at this point in your life. You want to leave her because you have allowed yourself to fall in love with another woman. </p> 
              <p>Could your wife’s resistance to children be a factor in making you vulnerable to another? Absolutely. But my guess is that isn’t the main reason. I don’t have the space or time here to explain how one falls in love with another person than his spouse, but I think I can give you the quick outline…</p> 
              <p>You became friends.</p> 
              <p>Your friendship deepened as you gradually began to share more about your lives, your dreams, your fears, and even those things about yourselves that hardly anyone else knows about. </p> 
              <p>At some point you began to feel that she understood you like no one ever has…that you can talk to her about anything…that the connection you two have is beyond what most people ever have and that it may be that no one else has ever felt the way you do about each other. You reached a point of emotional connection that you don’t know how to describe it to others because you doubt anyone else has ever felt this way.</p> 
              <p>Though you didn’t set out to compare her with your wife, eventually you did. You see your lover’s attributes. You find yourself seeing primarily your wife’s flaws. As time passes, those flaws take even larger meaning to you and you’ve come to believe that you should never have been with her.</p> 
              <p>Any of this sound familiar so far?</p> 
              <p>Now things that are valid – such as your differences about children – have become so much larger and stronger motivations to you than they were even before. They loom so big that you cannot imagine staying with your wife. What you wanted before from her is now available from your lover. The beliefs and values that kept you with your spouse are fading and your desire to be with your lover is growing stronger at a rapid and amazing rate.</p> 
              <p>So, how does it end? </p> 
              <p>If you leave your wife and go with your lover, the intensity that you feel now – the emotions that both you and she expect to last happily ever after – will eventually fade. You can still care about each other, but the amazing sensations you feel now will inevitably erode into something different. When finally that happens, you will see that she is flawed as well. Everyone is. You. Your lover. Your wife. </p> 
              <p>And that’s when your lover and you will begin finally to understand what you’ve given up to have each other. You will look back on the beliefs and values that you once held dear that you violated to have her. And, if you are like the vast majority, you will come to regret your abandoning what you once held dear.</p> 
              <p>You definitely have a problem with your wife that needs to be resolved. As long as you are involved with your lover, you won’t.</p> 
              <p>These are two separate problems. To be able to face the future with high regard for yourself, solve your problems with your wife. After you deal with that, then make a decision about your lover. As long as you are putting your lover first, you cannot make a decision about your lover that you will be happy about ten years from now.</p>

                  <p>I agree with you on this, I understand that marriage is an important commitment. I understand that some people believe marriage to be final and sacred. However, you can’t disregard the feelings in a second relationship. I understand that we seek the things we feel we are missing, that we want to feel complete. But feelings are feelings, and I dont believe a marriage trumps the heart. It wants what it wants. They keep saying that we are only focusing on the flaws of our spouse and the things we love about the new person. That is not the case, at least with what I’m experiencing. I understand that everyone has flaws, everyone! But when you know in your heart and soul that this new person you met has touched you so deeply, you love the flaws as well, in my case of course. I can’ speak for everyone, but I elieve that when it comes to how you feel about your marriage or your second elationship, they are both valid feelings that shouldnt be disregarded just because the marriage has more “importance”. You will find what’s most important in your heart and then you’ll decide. I already decided, maybe evn before it got so serious. Be an adult and make a decision. Live with the consequences of your actions.</p>

                <p>You just described what I am going through exactly. This has helped me tremendously. I’ve been so torn, being married to someone 5 years, and finding someone else I connect with SO much that she feels more like “the one” than my wife ever did. But I see now, this isn’t the route to take, no matter how tempting it is. The situation sucks, because the love is very real.</p>

                <p>Can’t you say the exact same about any new relationship, though? I’m sure he probably felt the same way for his wife when they first met. Everybody feels that way when they meet someone new and most people also are aware that this “honeymoon phase” does in fact, not last forever. I don’t really feel that telling someone they won’t always feel that way for their new lover, and so they might want to consider working it out with their current spouse, is good and sound advice. Sorry.</p>

                  <p>Sam, while it is true that many relationships do begin with limerence, the real issue here is whether or not you have a right to the person that you are in limerence with. If two people are single, fall in love, and go through limerence, that is normal. If one or both people are married and they do not have a right to one another, that’s when things change. See, many people follow their “feelings” instead of their “commitments”. Feelings change. Even when two people have a right to each other, limerence fades. It always does. Biologically and chemically, it has to. When people begin to abandon their commitments, their marriages, and their beliefs, then once the limerence fades with the person they didn’t have a right to, they will begin to feel guilty and many times will resent the person they had the affair with. If someone follows their feelings and betrays their integrity, they change who they are as a person. They will turn into a person that they no longer like.</p>

            <p>My marriage of 29 years has never been the marriage that I dreamed of. I find myself to be more of a father-figure to my wife than that of a husband. I have never liked this role. My wife and I have had many discussions about this before. For all these years, I have just accepted the way things are. I can’t accept it anymore.</p> 
            <p>I met a lady online 8 months ago. She seemed really nice and intelligent. We have been really good friends and can talk about anything. We have shared so much between us and it has turned out to be a beautiful friendship. For that, I am very grateful! But in the last month, a very strong attraction of ‘more than friends’ between us have developed; we have been having an emotional affair. She seems to be a perfect match for me, and she is everything that my wife is not. We are supposed to meet in person for a few drinks soon. </p> 
            <p>I am very afraid of what can happen when we actually meet. I can see how this situation could go really bad, really fast. She is everything that I could ever want in a partner, BUT I don’t want to hurt anyone, especially my wife. I have to admit that I am torn right now, not knowing what to do. Should I pursue my happiness with this other person or should I stay in this less than adequate marriage and acknowledge the fact that it is all just a dream. </p> 
            <p>Deep down, I don’t want to be married to the one I am married to. But I certainly don’t want to be the cause of my wife’s sadness either. The temptation is there. I never thought it was possible, certainly not possible for me. But here I am.</p>

            <p>I have been married for ten years. My husband and I have had many issues in our marriage. For the last three years I have connected with a man I met when I was 15 years old. I talk to him everyday on fb. I have fallen madly in love with him. He lives in Boston and me Toronto. I often fall asleep thinking of him. The problem is I’m married and I have a daughter who loves her dad much. I feel so stuck and just want to cry.</p>

            <p>Im married for 16 years. I dont feel a connection to my husband anymore. I got in contact with an old guy friend and I think we have fallen in love.

              <p>You may see money, or financial commitments being a part in this, in reality it is an excuse to stay with your husband. Your child together may also be a factor but neither are the issue. </p> 
              <p>First off what led you to reconnect? Was a simple Hey old friend… or did you put yourself in that situation. Two different things with different purposes. Just to catch up and have coffee doesn’t always lead to a love affair unless both parties are already emotionally open to that. </p> 
              <p>From my perspective it seems as if you have some still untesolved issue with your husband. Either for the infidelity he committed or something else. Either way though that is yet another excuse you have given yourself to ease the pain that you are committing emotional cheating.</p> 
              <p>Before I would run with a man that was willing to help destroy a marriage, i would try to rekindle those feelings that helped rebuild it after your husband cheated. Look at this way he could be forgiving you because its “fair”. Or because in his moment of weakness he knew the regret, and wants to save the marriage. </p> 
              <p>You both should seek help, to cheat on one another, physically or emotionally shows a serious underlying issue.</p> 
              <p>My best to you. As humans we all make mistakes, as wives and husbands we learn to fix them.</p>

            <p>Its really embarrassing to actually say this, but here goes…<br> I have been married to my husband going on 5 years. We weren’t together but just a few weeks when he asked me to marry him. We were in our upper teens when we got married. Within our first year of marriage he had talked to another woman online and I caught him up in it. I let it go and tried to work it out with him, after all it was just our first year. So a few months later I got pregnant with our baby girl. I thought everything was getting back to normal. My trust for him was finally starting to build back up. Til one evening I got on his phone and came acoss a text message to his best friend saying that he was gonna get ‘some’ from someone else. I found a fake facebook he had created with a fake name, but he told women who he really was. I hacked into the email he had used and seen that he had been talking sexually to multiple women that knew him and I was married. I also found out that the messages dated back to almost a year ago. I let all that go and once again tried to forgive and forget. But my feelings for him were slowly starting to fade it seemed. We recently moved out of town due to a new job he got. Just in a couple weeks of living in our new town, I was introduced to a friend he had years ago. We hit it off and became good friends. We started talking and im not sure how it came up but we told each other we liked each other. We started eventually texting and he started coming over and just hanging out while my husband was working. Things to physical fast. We talked about our feelings and he knows what had happened in the past with me and my husband. We did end up going all the way but we talked and said that we need to both slow it back down. I am just so torn on what to do with my marriage. Every kiss and every touch puts thoughts from the past into my head. I wonder everyday if more went on other than what he has told me. I don’t want kisses from him anymore. I feel out of love with him. Our daughter is 2 now and I feel like if I was to leave it would destroy everything. Our new house and his new job. And his friend ship with the other man. I honestly feel stuck like im obligated to stay. And I feel like of I was to leave I would end up with nothing. He doesn’t show me that he loves me. I dont feel pretty anymore with him. This other guy has made me feel so good and he has done everything and said everything that a woman wants to hear. As of now him and I are just in a friendship but it makes me wonder what would happen if I was to leave my husband. Would I be making a mistake or is this other guy truly the one for me.</p>

            <p>I am 30 years old, have been married for 6 years this past July, my husband and I have a beautiful 5 year old. I came across this site because I am searching for solutions to my problems currently. I met my husband in church, due to the marriage processes in our church, we never had a chance to properly get to know each other better. So in a space of 7 months we got married. My marriage was averagely good, I fell pregnant on my honeymoon night, so immediately after the wedding I was pregnant. I had my daughter and after that my husband and I were heavily involved in our church ministry. Beginning of last year my husband resigned from work and went back to university to study full time, as a result we do not see each other except for weekends and school holidays. When he went back to school, I started realising that I married a complete stranger, we had never spent real time together before we got married and with the baby and the ministry we were always busy, so when he went back to school I started realising just how different we were. I truly am not even show if I love or ever loved him, or my whole marriage was out of family and church pressure. I do not blame anyone because I was old and am responsible for my own choices. Now I have recently met someone, who is the world to me, I do not ever recall being this happy in my life before. We share the same passions, we laugh together, his presence in my life has changed me. I have told my husband before that I don’t think I can ever love him the way he does me, I told him how I felt about marrying young and for all other reason besides love. Besides having met someone now, I was already trying to find means of leaving my husband. I feel I am very unfair to him because I really do not love him the way he loves me. I believe that there is someone special out there for him to love him and cherish but that person is not me. How can I walk away without hurting our daughter, our families, our church. I do not wanna leave my husband for this new love, I want to leave him because I don’t love him</p>

              <p>Hi, I am almost in the same position. I have been married for 12 years now. I got married when I was 26. My husband and I are in to church ministry and our parents too. Im not sure if I married my husband because I love him or because it was a pressure from church &amp; parents because the standards required us to merry before we can have sex or be close in anyway. We have 3 beautiful children right now. Im not sure if I love my husband or have I ever love him. I just can’t explain this. Right now im busy trying to find some sort of fulfilment in a lot of things. Every time I look at him I feel so sorry for him because I feel like im a hypocrite. I am lost I need help. I feel I can’t convince my self that I love this man anymore. I also came across this site because Im looking for help.</p>

            <p>My situation is a bit more intense. 4 years ago I reunited with an ex boyfriend, in which case we exchanged numbers and immediately started communicating. The catch 22 here is, it is my husband friend as well. We have been seeing each other for 4 years and during that time he has gotten married and had a child. Even with his union, we still have not stopped seeing each other. He tells me he is in love with me. Not sure if I believe him. As for me all I do is think about him. I think he is the first person I have ever been in love with. I say that because I don’t think I have ever felt this way about my husband. I have tried to end it so many times and find myself right back with him days later. I don’t know what to do anymore. I cry so much over this. Cry over hurting so many people if we ever get caught. Cry over loving him, when all I want is to fall in love with my husband. Don’t kmow what to do</p>

            <p>I’ve been married for almost 10 years, and our marriage has never been consistently “good.” I’ve pondered divorce several times, but we have two young children and I’ve stuck around for them. Over the 10 years my husband has been extremely jealous and possessive, even when there wasn’t a reason to be that way. I’ve been hit twice, he’s had several druken rage episodes, and I’ve been called every name in the book. Three years ago, I caught him texting an ex of his – they texted literally 24 hours a day, for 30 days before I caught him. I stayed with him and I have never held it over his head. At the time, I had become detached from our marriage and was just going through the motions, so I completely understood how he got to the point of reaching out to someone else. Our marriage was “good” for a few months after that, but of course we end up going right back into a bad spot. It’s just a constant roller coaster – most of the time I don’t even like him, much less love him. We got married after dating for 30 days (stupidest thing I’ve ever done), and I’ve always thought we never should’ve gotten married. </p> 
            <p>16 months ago a friend and I started texting and over the period of a few weeks it led to talking, then finding time to see one another, etc. It never went beyond kissing, but I fell for him so fast. I won’t go into all the details – it was just a wonderful friendship/relationship and for the first time in over a decade, I really connected with someone. He was going through a separation at the time, and since then, his ex and I have actually become “email friends” – I knew her beforehand, but she and I oddly connected after everything came out. We still email and check on one another, provide advice, etc. So, yes, we got caught – it was a perfect opportunity for me to get out of my marriage, but I didn’t because of my kids. My issue now is – it’s been 16 months and I still think about him nonstop. Our “relationship” ended so abruptly with no contact or finality to how things ended. I eventually reached out so we could discuss things, and since then, we’ve communicated periodically. Feelings are still there, but I’m not available so we will not put ourselves in a situation to hurt people again. I feel stuck. If I leave my husband, it honestly will not be FOR the other guy – it will be because my marriage sucks and has always sucked, but I’m sure my feelings for the other guy do not help my cause.</p>

            <p>Hi, I was married to my former spouse for 6 years have one child with her and i got remarried a year after our divorce now also with a child with my new spouse…I have felt that my first marriage ended for selfish reasons, i had just returned from being deployed overseas and felt i wanted to be alone when i came back i was’nt myself. I ended the marriage. I met my now spouse a few months after we separated i felt it was what i needed at the time now being married to her i feel i made a huge mistake and she does not make me feel the way my former spouse made me feel. My former spouse is not remarried, although she has expressed that she wish things could have been different and would have worked through the prior marriage. I find myself looking for things in my spouse now that I saw in my former spouse and i’m always remembering how she made me feel and what my spouse now does not make me feel. I’m in a pickle and i do not know what to do. Do what’s right and stay in the marriage? Or just end the marriage and be honest with her although i would like a chance with my former spouse i would spend time alone thinking about my life and how quickly things spun out of control.</p>

            <p>My husband and I met very young and now we’re married. Have been for two years and now have a child together. I lost my virginity to him and feel like I owe my life to him. I love him, but I’m in love with somebody else. It hasn’t gotten physical, but it has gotten emotional and spiritual to the point where he’s in my dreams and I see my husband as the problem, but he’s done nothing wrong. And I think it’s just the attention and affection I’m getting from my “lover” getting to me emotionally… But I feel in my soul that I love this man and not my husband. My husband doesn’t know any of this and I don’t want to hurt anybody… I don’t know what to do</p>

            <p>It was good advice, but I’m still stuck. I’m a military wife and I have a 1y/o daughter. The other man I’m in love with I have known for a long time and I know almost everything about him. As we became friends, I fell more in love with him. I’m also 21 and feel like I married too early. My husband is a good man, but he has a dark past that is starting to shine through finally.. His persona is becoming more violent and inpatient, especially towards our daughter. We’ve talked about it, but nothing has changed. And when the other guy is around, he spoils my daughter and plays with her!! She loves him!! So I’m torn horribly! I don’t wanna give up on a marriage, but I’ve tried to fix the flaws for years and I’m tired of trying all by myself. Love works both ways, and with the other man- it’s true. I don’t know what to do at all.</p>

            <p>So many stories, so many people going through similar situations…</p> 
            <p>Married for 10 years, mostly unhappy. I’ve never been a priority to him and no amount of talking/fighting about it ever changed anything. We have a 7 year old son, and until very recently they barely had a relationship. I met someone this summer and my feelings for him are growing stronger by the day. I honestly know that it won’t work out between us, but the feelings he has awakened in me have made me realize how unhappy I’ve been. I want to leave my husband – not for the new man, but for me.</p>

            <p>Well I can’t exactly say that I’m married but I have been with the same man for over 8 years now. My significant other hasn’t been able to work for over 5 years now. There was a time that I couldn’t imagine a day without him but things have changed. Now to give you a bit of insight into my current relationship the reason he hasn’t been able to work is because he deals with a lot of different mental illnesses. I have been here standing by his side through all of it. He is constantly telling me how if it wasn’t for me he wouldn’t be alive right now. With his friends and his family I am constantly being thanked and being praised for how strong I am to stand by his side for everything. And it is true I am strong but I don’t think I’m as strong as everyone is making me out to be. Which brings us to a little while ago when in enters someone from my past. This guy from my past let’s call him Sweetheart I’ve known for a few years longer then I have my significant other. Sweetheart has seen me at my worst and even though we were only friends he always made sure I was ok. It was clear right from the day we met that we shared some pretty intense feelings for one another. We never got our shot due to one or both of us being in other relationships. Eventually I made the decision that I needed to try and move on from sweetheart and shortly after that is when I met my significant other. Sweetheart and I lost touch almost 5 years ago but there wasn’t a day that I didn’t wonder how he was doing or if he was happy with his significant other. Sweetheart coming back into my life has made me realize that I haven’t been happy for awhile. I care deeply for my significant other I just don’t feel like I’m in love with him. Now don’t get me wrong my significant other can be a good guy but most of the time he treats me as if I don’t really exist. I’m thinking part of the reason why is because of his mental illnesses but I don’t believe that is the full reason. My significant other despite many conversations with him in regards to how I’m being treated never changes. And then last week he started paying more attention to me … which fits the normal pattern (every time I start to really think about our relationship and if I should just do what I feel is right for me and end things my significant other does a 180 and starts treating me the way I have always longed to be treated). With Sweetheart it’s different. Especially since he has come back into my life. Now I’ve been trying to do the right thing and sort out all my feelings towards my significant other before thinking of anyone else, but I couldn’t control it. I love Sweetheart I always have we just have never had the chance to be together. And I know Sweetheart loves me as he has told me a few times since coming back into my life. Which brings us to tonight. Sweetheart proposed to me. I didn’t say yes but I couldn’t say no either. I just told him that now wasn’t the right time, that I needed the time to figure out what I need to do for me and that I hoped he understood. I know that hurt Sweetheart and I hated hurting him like that. I just couldn’t say yes … not while I’m still in a relationship. I just hate this situation I’m in. I’m in love with Sweetheart and when I think of the future he is in it. I’m just worried that if I end things with my significant other he will finally end up committing suicide (again he is always telling me I’m the reason he is still alive). A part of me thinks that it’s just his way of making sure I never leave but a part of me worries that he will actually try to end his life if I end things with him. Any advice is appreciated.</p>

              <p>33 yrs ago I had been married for several years at that time and I had a short affair. I stopped seeing the other woman without explanation. Something was wrong with me and no one could figure out what! I went to bed and spent the next 18 yrs in bed fighting for my life. It’s been a long hard struggle for me but I’m living a more normal life again.Problem is I don’t love my wife the way I once did.My wife has done absolutely nothing wrong! Thoughts of the other woman are eating at me.I can’t get her out of my mind! I went on Facebook and found her.She’s married/divorced not sure? She has 2 adult daughters. The man she was married to, is engaged to another woman.So I assume she is divorced.I messaged her on Facebook, no reply. Shortly thereafter her page was taken down.I know her home address and phone number.I want to send her a real letter,on paper and in an envelope.Just to make contact and explain my circumstances and see how she’s doing.I really want to know about her journey in life thus far, possibly reacquainting ourselves or developing a friendship.Is all of this crazy? What kind of trouble could I get myself into? These feelings to see her are tearing me apart! I’m willing to do about anything to make this happen! I saw a current picture of her on another Facebook page and she’s as beautiful as she was back then! I’m blinded by all of this and only see what I want to see! Many of you see what I don’t and that’s what I would like to hear about.Any and all opinions/advice would be considered! I’m in real pain!</p>

            <p>My husband starting talking to an acquaintance from high school in Feb 2014 It has quickly escalated into an emotional affair. they are on facebook day and night. She is jealous of me yet when I try to make them see each other (she lives 6 hours away and is married too) Unhappily supposedly she told my husband he is her soul mate sends him inspirational messages everyday. My husband says he is in love with her but loves me and never intended to leave. She says it would tear her heart apart if he left his children. I dont know what to do. She says she is a woman of Jesus on her Facebook. She wont let him go. My husband says he loves me but wont look me in the eye and yes we still have sex. He used to be such a good man. Please I need advice. They won’t stop He is also going thru midlife.</p>

              <p>First, an affair with an ex, even emotional, is a different animal. it isn’t about the newness, its about something you either don’t bring to your husband or something about himself he isn’t being true to when with you. Find it, and maybe it can help. Don’t drop the midlife crisis crap. If you had said ‘transitioning to another phase of life’ it would be more believable. We each move through three major phases in life. If you aren’t feeling one, and he is…you are growing apart! Good luck.</p>

            <p>My husband and I have been married only a little over a year. He was 25 when we got married and I was only a month away from turning 19. We only dated 9 months before getting engaged and waited another 9 months before getting married. In hind-sight we rushed it . I never really felt a burning passion for my husband and never really expected to. He was and is someone I look up to and ultimately feel comfortable with . I wouldn’t say I am in love with him, however, I want him in my life … But not so much as a lover . The problem is and I have talked andthiught through these feelings a hundred times and every time they get more and more confusing …I have two guys who love me deeply …one of whom I care for , but I feel is holding me back from a lot of things I want to do in my life (though he tries to support them) and the other? Well he’s my best friend who wants me to go out and be myself as well as to do those things with me . I would NEVER leave my husband for this other guy,that’s just stupid…but I have realized I feel held back and am not sure if I am where I should be … I tried to leave my husband explaining this … But I couldn’t stand to watch him cry or for him to completely leave my life . I tried discussing a break or separation (I know it is unfair of me to ask him to wait) but each time I have to watch him cry and decide to not go through with it and hold onto the emptiness and pain I feel … I don’t know what to do .. I need him in my life … But the only way he wants to be in my life is as my husband …he really has been trying .., we are even looking at counselors .., please help</p>

            <p>I am a hard worker, smart, detail oriented and a successful person. This created an enemy for me at work and caused it to be horrible as he is a manipulator and used to effect on peoples opinions about me, until I met him. We have lots of common, in our core values, but he is married and I took him as a friend. I was happy to be able to be his friend and for 2 years we were, until I got engaged!<br> My x guy now, was bad news and I end up ending it, after 11 months. He was a shell and once his mother “a war machine” in the picture, it is all down to hell road. I was emotionally hurt, broken, exhausted and it was horrible. On top of that, my friend, took a step back and was away. I was deeply hurt by his distance but I thought he is giving me a space. I honestly had a thing for him since ever, but I never look at married men! It is a no situation. Now after broken my engagement slowly my friend came back and I welcomed him.. He then chose to tell me he loves me.<br> I see it, the process you talk about in ALL .. how a man get a friend and thinks she get him in all. I do but I don’t know if I am unique in it, we just had this acceptance since ever and I agree, with him I am more open and accepting because I love him “real love”.<br> I told him he has a wife and kids, a family he said was always enough and he was accepting life and happy with it. He shouldn’t do this. It created a huge problem for me and at times I became weak and told him I had feelings too. [which was a mistake]</p> 
            <p>I was broken and fragile and just in the worst times, and he didn’t see my best interest and just told me how he feels. In a way his love, made be heal better, but it also hurt me a lot. We were platonic, not even flirting but the comfort and level of connection we had, made me feel bad. I told him we have to face it, this is NOT good. I know we did nothing wrong but say: I love you but that can make “everything I feel for him is wrong” and I can’t do it to myself. He also was regretting telling me big times. </p> 
            <p>We have a great friendship and we can be blunt, totally honest and still love each other. We have a “real love” connection, or at least I do. I love for him to be happy, to live his life happy and I believe it is “something” he misses, or have that made him do this! I do want to help him and I am actually glad I can see it, heal my wounds and say finally he is not the man of my life and though I love him a lot, though I would take him if he was single, he is not and I am not going there. </p> 
            <p>We are still friends, good ones but how I will know he is not still doing it wrong? How can I help him repair his life ‘because he is a friend, a mentor, a brother, and lots to me” and I want him happy. I am a positive person and I love caring and giving, naturally.</p> 
            <p>I easily forgive and that’s why I forgave him, even though everyone tell me he is a bad news and I should never be his friend. I don’t see it this way and he is truly good, and he know he made a mistake and I love having him in my life. Most people know him from me speaking of him, so I can’t count on those to be fair. </p> 
            <p>I know I will not make a mistake but I want to ensure he doesn’t live his life unhappy. I know he can have it all! Can you help ? We are not in USA, and come from Indian/Turkish background. </p> 
            <p>I should say at times I believed he is my other half, we are different but totally the same. He still says I complete him and we have this huge level of understanding. I can understand him from his eyes before I knew him to this level and we had a sense of we met before “familiarity” since we first met. It is like we have the same core, in two personality and when we were friends I used to joke, we must be twins! Because we do have a spiritual connection “which is the first thing that connect us” like my soul recognised his soul and harmonise with it. And with him I have no fears, and feel totally safe. I never had that before but I also accept now it is not limited to him. </p> 
            <p>I wonder also if I should stop being friends with him ? If it is harmful for me ? for him ?<br> I would hate that but I am OK to do it if it is needed. I want to do the best for me and him. Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi.. I’m 22 and recently got married to a 33 year old. We’ve only known each other for 6 months. I was in a relationship for 2 years with a sweet person but we were having problems. The 33 year old stepped in and showed me a moment of happiness. I took that feeling and ran with it because I haven’t felt that way in a long time. However that was a big mistake! I was sold a dream and a fantasy. I am having more problems than ever before. I’m still in love with my ex… the feelings are mutual. But I caused so much hurt and pain. We were suppose to be getting married this year. But I was so broken and so weak. I’m not happy. I need help. I feel like I’m settling.</p>

            <p>I been married 26 years. We both married young. I was 22 he was 25. On our wedding night we fought. Since my Dad was not around growing up. I think my husband was a father figure…many years later I meet a guy we just text for years. Then I fell for him. Just wondering why he doesn’t talk to me anymore. Just were friends or was it more. My marriage to my husband is fighting all the time. I think we grew apart overtime. Don’t know what I should do. Helpless…</p>

            <p>I’ve been married for twelve years and have three kids. During the twelve years, I gave 100% of me to my spouse. He had been both verbally and emotionally abusive for pretty much the whole time with some nice days here and there. I begged cried and pleaded for him to please stop being mean, ignoring me, disrespecting me, walking on me, hurting me in every way imaginable except physically. A year ago I started talking to a man online and while at first we were friends, about six months ago, we realized we were falling for each other. Three weeks ago I told my husband I was done because I couldn’t take it anymore. Now he is crying and pleading with me to stay and he’s sorry and will do whatever it takes to change and save our marriage. If I’m honest, I don’t want to save it. It’s been a long painful road and I’m having trouble forgetting what he has done to make me put up the wall I now have. I don’t expect anything to happen with my online guy but the thought that there is love out there that will build me up and I will be equal and loved, makes me want to find it. I need help. I’m battling guilt of wanting to give up but honestly, I don’t know how to fight for something that’s meant so much to me and nothing to him and now it means everything to him. I’m having trouble. Please, any advice helps.</p>

            <p>Help me please I am so confused. I have been married to my husband for just one and a half years but recently I started a new job and now I find myself in love with one of my colleagues who is also married with a young child he tells me every day that he loves me too but I don’t know what to do now. When I am around my colleague I feel happiness like I have never felt before he means so much to me and the thought of not having him in my life is unbearable but I also do not want to be the cause of my husband having a broken heart my husband has told me on 3 separate occasions without any knowledge of what is going on “if you want to end this its no problem for me” but I can’t seem to bring myself to walk away. Please give me some advixe.</p>

            <p>Been married over 34 years and we’re not compatible sexually. I’ve tried my best to work this out. I love touching, feeling, caressing, hugging and kissing. My wife just lays there like a corpse and will not have oral sex either. I’ve known this married co worker at my job for over 30 years and I’m in love her her and the feeling is mutual but both of us have been faithful up until now. We’re both in our 60’s . My heart aches for love. I want to be her right now. Just don’t know what to do. Can’t wait to go to work on Monday to see her. It’s very depressing to say the least. I want our bodies to be one.</p>

            <p>I’ve been having an affair for about 2 years now.<br> Been married to my husband for 14 years with 2 preteens.<br> My husband and I dated off and on since Highschool and decided to marry in our 20’s . We carry a lot of pain from our past. From the hurtful things we did to eat other as teenagers. Seems our past will alway haunt us. It always comes up in arguments. I have found him cheating 2-4 times since we’ve been married. I feel like I’ve always had to be the strong on to hold our family down.<br> My husband is a great father and provider. Just really bad about verbally respecting me and the pain a carry from him stepping out of our marriage is everlasting .<br> 3 years ago I decided I had enough when I found out he once again cheated. Because financial reasons we lived under the same roof but was separated . I started to emotionally move on. Started going out with the ladies and enjoying myself. I was out one night and ran into my ex that I haven’t seen in 14 years. Someone I was madly in love with in the past. (We broke up because I got pregnant with my 1st born and I wanted to do the right thing and marry my baby’s father/ high school sweetheart. I wanted a family more than anything.) He was single. Just out of a relationship as well. So we exchange numbers that night. Short story, became friends again . Was helping each other thru our break ups and feels started back right where they left off. We got together one night and it was a night full of passion.<br> We have the best relationship . Talk , respect , romance and it feels like we truly know each other.<br> Except about a year ago, my husband decides to ” change” . He pledes me back. And I thought I would leave this passionate guy who took my heart alone. But I just couldn’t.<br> So I told my husband I broke it off with him. And kept doing what I do with the other guy on the side. In the back of my mind I thought my husband was just going to fail. But I’ve been wrong.<br> It’s been 2 years and he’s become the perfect husband that I’ve always wanted him to be! He’s everything I want!<br> Except I think I’m in love with the other guy.<br> I can’t keep living two lives!! Something needs to change and I really need o make a decision on what I want. Guy number 2 is wanting more from me now. And all anog I’ve been lying to him and saying I’m still separated from my husband and just roommates to help financially! And I’m sure my husband must be thinking something . It’s just a matter of time!!<br> I’m just lost!! I don’t know what true love really is and which one is lust. I do truly care for both men.<br> So confused!!</p>

            <p>I married my husband six years ago. We became friends because he was socially marginalized and I’ve always been drawn to befriending the vulnerable. I did not love him at the time of marriage, but decided to get married because (1) in the ten years preceding my marriage, my parents had become increasingly derisive about my age and the need to settle down, and (2) my husband was the first man I slept with. The Sunday-school girl in me felt tremendous guilt and thought marriage would appease the guilt. </p> 
            <p>My husband is a good person. I respect his strong sense of honor and responsibility. Unfortunately, he’s also very pessimistic. I’ve joked with him that if the optimist says the glass is half and the pessimist says the glass is half empty, my husband will say, “the glass is half-empty, there are fingerprints on the glass, both the water and the glass cost too much, the light in the room is too dim that you can’t see the water clearly and in any case the water probably tastes terrible because the world is overpopulated and humanity has been polluting the streams for thousands of years.” </p> 
            <p>He also has deep insecurities. In the seven years I’ve known him, he hasn’t had any friends. In time, I’ve also become increasingly isolated because I’m embarrassed to take him to events. He will not undertake any potentially confrontational tasks such as car purchasing, mortgage discussions, utility connections, tax filings, or anything that involves third parties. He will, however, want to thoroughly debrief the matter after I’ve reached a resolution and offer a critique my solution. His insecurities may also contribute to performance anxiety, but we have a sexless marriage, no kids, and he believes mid-thirties are too old to have kids now. </p> 
            <p>I care about him a good deal and want to love him. I’ve organized numerous dates, couple activities, and vacations to “kindle” (not re-kindle) the romance but it inevitably ends with me feeling frustrated. I feel like I spend considerable time and money arranging activities which he invariably finds fault with. </p> 
            <p>About three years ago, I realized how vulnerable my marriage was when my male colleague called about a work issue and we ended talking late into the night. I could joke and debate with my colleague without worrying about hurting his feelings and it was a relief to not feel emotionally drained after a conversation. I enjoyed the conversation so much that I continued to have long phone discussions for three months before my guilt became such that I changed jobs and asked my husband to attend marital counseling with me. He refused because of the expense and his strong belief that counselors are no-value-add-money pits. </p> 
            <p>A year ago, I met another man. Again, it was a relief to talk to someone and not feel emotionally drained. Again I struggled with a considerable degree of self-loathing for months. I’m consider divorce. It’s very difficult to consider departing from my Christian beliefs, hurting a husband I care about, and disappointing my parents and friends. Nevertheless, I continue to consider divorce because of the hopeless sadness I feel when I contemplate walking through the remainder of my life with my husband and without even the consolation of children.</p>

            <p>I wish I could call or attend one of your workshops, but I live overseas and I won’t be back for another year…if I come back at all, to be honest.</p> 
            <p>I apologize for a long story but I feel I must tell it because I need help and have nowhere to go. I grew up in a very sheltered household as an only-child and went to an all-boys school up until college. I never interacted with girls at all until college. I joined a church and became very involved with it, and met a woman 5 years my senior and we dated for a little over a year and a half, at which point I discovered her visa would expire within a few months (she was an immigrant). Being inexperienced and afraid of the pain of a break up I decided we should get married, and for some crazy reason both of our parents gave us approval. It’s been almost 4 years since then. We were both students and during the entire four years we were essentially living off of student loan leftovers and support from parents. About two years into the marriage, I started to feel like maybe this was a stupid decision. I had zero dating experience and didn’t want to experience heartbreak, and in her culture there is a stigma against women who are unmarried and childless past 30. I think we both just latched on to whoever came our way. In addition to that, we have lots of issues. Every marriage has issues, but I don’t know if these can be fixed. Her family and friends drive me insane. They always have. There are other things she does that bother me, and I’m not perfect either. We can’t communicate openly with each other about these. When I try to discuss an issue I either get hostility and she explodes with the issues she has with me but for some reason never tried communicating, or she plays a pouting guilt trip and then giggles like a little kid when I take back what I said. On occasion she will recognize the issue and say she will work on it, but then never does or temporarily fixes it and relapses a short time later. She wants kids within the next 3 years, I’m not sure if I want kids at all, etc. I made a list of goods and bads in our relationship, and aside from her being kind and supportive, the list of bads is exponentially longer and a constant source of stress and irritation for me. </p> 
            <p>Now we live separately due to work, and I feel our futures are going separate ways. My degree, qualifications, and language skill limit me to working overseas. I am unqualified to work in the US, and even if I were I refuse to because life is much better for me here (healthcare, etc.). My wife had planned on getting a degree and acquiring the language skill to work here with me, but that fell through and she cannot work here, and I will not be able to support her on one salary. When she visited for a month I could tell she really didn’t like it here as much as I did and she was quite irritable (it doesn’t help that there is a lot of hatred between her home country and the country in which I currently live). Her family recently opened a business in my hometown and that’s where she’s working now. My future is here overseas, and her future is back home with her family store. </p> 
            <p>So here I am, wondering why I got married before getting my life together, perfectly content being alone here in a foreign country. I’ve made quite a few friends–male and female–but kept my guard up and I’ve never thought of any of my female friends as anyone I would consider dating even if I were single. And then I randomly met one girl and dropped my guard slightly (nothing physical), and within a couple of hours I felt like I had known this person my entire life. As if I had met her at some point in the past. At this point I’m totally confused because I’m not sure if the person I married was the person I was supposed to marry, and even though I know nothing good could come from this other person I met, it makes me feel as if there is someone else out here that I’m supposed to be with. But for some reason my wife isn’t unhappy with our marriage, despite the fact that if I were in her position I would have dumped me long ago, and while I’m not in love with her as a husband should be, I don’t want to hurt her. Even though I already have so many times.</p>

            <p>My life has been one that has been controlled by fear and loneliness. I have always felt unloved and unwanted and fear of being alone has lead me into many relationships. I crave being talked to. I crave the intimacy of conversation and time spent together. </p> 
            <p>When I first dated my wife all the red flags were flying in my mind. She is extremely introverted and damaged psychologically. I was extremely lonely in the dating period but married her because we had become sexually active and I was fearful no one would ever come to really love me for who I am. </p> 
            <p>We separated our seven year of marriage because my loneliness within the marriage lead me to seeking relationship out of the home. After seven years apart and two short term relationships and her in four relationships I turned to religion and once more married my first wife. We have been together now 13 years and once again I am suffering mightily from loneliness. I have come to the point of almost hating her for leaving me so lonely. I want out of our marriage even if that means I never ever love again. </p> 
            <p>I know people can’t and don’t really change. I made a terrible mistake by choosing a woman who cannot physically make herself talk to me. What pains me in this is there will once again be fear on my part. Fear of loneliness and fear of spending the rest of my life alone. </p> 
            <p>Yet I cannot help but think by staying with her I will also rob her of ever being truly loved. </p> 
            <p>I don’t care about the religious feelings toward me because I know longer attend church. I don’t want an affair because I know by experience that they do not last and you often lose both women. </p> 
            <p>So, I don’t know what I expect you to say but I already know I will disagree with you. I have been suicidal for at least three years maybe up to six years because of loneliness. Staying with her will only strengthen my resolve to commit suicide. Leaving her a second time hurts like hell because it destroys me and rips my heart apart to hurt anyone.</p>

            <p>I have been married for 3 years, but in the relationship for 11 and living together for 7. No kids. We met very young and moved in together when we were 18. I have been having an emotional /sexual relationship with a man for 4 years. Most of our contact is through skype, Facebook, and the phone because we<br> live 1 1/2 hours away from each other and were both super busy. It started as just some fun, but the more we talked the more I fell for him. We have so much in common and share so many interests that my husband has no interest in. I have fallen completely in love with him. My husband is my best friend but mostly I think that’s all he is. The other guy has waited on me, but has recently gotten into a relationship with a girl. I have no idea how serious it is because we do not talk about it and frankly I don’t want to know. But nothing has really changed with us except I do not near from him all the time now. He has no idea that I do actually love him. My best friend who knows both of us thinks he’s trying to make me make a move, but I’m terrified. I’m glad I found this because this is the first somewhat article I’ve found about this. Mostly it’s people chastising those in my situation because of religious or guilt reasons. I just can’t imagine not talking to him and I don’t know what to do</p>

            <p>5 years ago I cheated on my 4 years marriage. Since then every year I travel to where my boyfriend lives for 3-4 month to spend time with him. Each time that I came back to my husband, I tried to forget about my boyfriend, but I haven’t been able to. My boyfriend is not an easy person, sometimes we argue together, but we have a great sex , he has been waiting for 5 years that I get my divorce to marry me, but I feel so guilty to leave my husband. My husband is a really good man and he loves me a lot, but I have no sexual attraction toward him, and we have sex together every 1 or2 weeks. I am 43 and running out of time to get pregnant, but still I don’t know with who. My husband is very passive, type B personality and my boyfriend is very active type A personality. With My husband I am type A, and with my boyfriend I am type B that I prefer. With my husband I am my own boss, but with my boyfriend I’m not. It has been a long time that I am so depressed for the mistake that I made to cheat on my husband and ended up here that I don’t know whom to leave and this month is the last month that I have to decide. Please help me☹</p>

            <p>Iv been married for almost 4 years, recently we seperated for 6 months and I met someone else who I feel is a better fit for my life. She has a great personality and very attractive, but I do still love my wife so I told her to come back home along with our 1 year old daughter. I tried leaving the other woman but something always keeps bringing me back to her. My mind tells me to stay with my family and work on our marriage but my heart tells me to leave and go with the other woman and live happily ever after. Only after reading so many things online statistics say it might not work out with the new woman..im so confused I dont want my daughter growing up to hate me and honestly there is nothing wrong with my wife.</p>

            <p>I’m married for 3years and a month now. We were just almost 5 months in our relationship when i got pregnant. He’s 5 years younger than me. When i told him about the situation, he’s drawn back and almost left me. He said over and over again that he’s not ready to be married yet. However, because of my father’s health issues, i pursuaded him to just get married because my family values honor too much and my parents are conservative. He did not want to get married and i’ve cried and pleaded so much just for him to agree because i am afraid my parents would be so hurt if i ended as a single parent. My husband then, agreed but, he had asked me ways to deceived my family. He even asked if we could fake it. I was so hurt on the processed but I have told him, just gave me the favor and i’ll let him be free after some time. Just for my parents’ sake. After a meaningless marriage, we lived as if everything’s normal. But the only normal thing we did as a couple was having sex. We never connected emotionally. He’s just not the type who will listen and guide or support. He’s selfish. We lived with my parents. My parents supported us financially until I began working again 2 years ago to support our child’s needs. For the past three years, he was a student for a year and a half and was never with me and our kid more than a month straight. He visited us during weekends and go back to his parents on weekdays as he’s still studying. After that, he leave us for an ojt for a year. Im certain, he missed the growing up of our child. Now, our son is three years old and during those short times my husband had a strong bond with our child. Likewise with the kid who always asks for his father. And it seems, my husband forgot everything from the past and treated me good. At present, he’s away for his job hunting for almost 2 months now. However, during those years we’re married, my feelings for him were on and off. But i am more on off. Deep down, i always sees his flaws and uncapability and i always dream in deepest of me to be free from this “marriage”. I was always confused with him. I even remembered my ex and thought i was still inlove with him. I cried for my ex even i already have a husband. Now, Im talking to a guy online for a month now. And i developed a certain degree of attraction to him. But im not certain if the feeling is mutual. However, he said he likes me though im difficult. And we’re from different country and discussed about meeting personally. Im excited about the idea. I always thought about this new man. I even began writing to my diary again because i was alarmed that i felt so vulnerable with this stranger. Now, I know what we have or will have is a different concern and not the most important thing here. My confusion is about me and my husband. I really wanted to be free but i do not know how to start saying it to him. And my son, i dont want him to get hurt and drag to this hurtful situation. He loves his father so much. But i cant feel anything with my husband now. No connection at all. I even wished for him to find another woman so it wont “start” with me.</p>

            <p>Hi<br> I got married when i was 24 which was 3 and half years ago, we’ve been trough a lot with my husband. I will start with me. I think I have a problem with relationships in general because I get this emotional affairs ( nothing physical ) even in my previous relationships… So the story with my husband. Everything happened very quickly I fell in love and everything was perfect , however after one and half year of marriage something went wrong and we became very cold with each other its like we didnt care for each other and then he cheated on me. We split up for a while, then we decided to try and fix our relationship. We did it for a while (2 years ) and now Evrrything is repeating i found someone that I really like, he is smart and we click together perfectly however.. I’ve read all the comments and I know that this is just an emotional attraction and I will have different problems with the new guys as well, but still I don’t know what to do ? How do I fix this ? Is marriage all about fixing things all life. I really didn’t imagine it that way. What if this new guys is the man of my life and I am missing opportunity to be happy ;( I don’t want to make mistake and regret. But nothing seems right anymore.</p>

            <p>Hi, my name is Ryan and I have been with my wife for 12 years now. I have been with her since I was 15 and we just got married a few months ago. In the 12 year I have never cheated on her or even thought about it. Our relationship is good but there is a problem. Back when I was in high school I had fallen for a girl in my class. We would talk on off and on but had no physical contact. We lost contact for a few years and in that time she had a kid and was in an unhappy relationship. We started talking again a few years ago still no physical contact and my wife (then girlfriend) found out. After she found out I stop talking to the girl and moved on. Well she is back and I have been talking to her again dally and I have been meeting with her here and there still not sexual contact but I can see it going that way. Due to this I have been shutting out my wife who is causing her to be more suspicious and causing us to fight a lot more. I fell like this girl is the girl I should have been with and I feel love for her like no other but I am struggling with is this real or is this because I’ve been in with my wife for so long and no one else and I’m just addicted to the “something new” I really feel like I love her but at the same time I don’t want to throw away everything and regret it. is this common and should I just end it as hard as it may be or if I love someone else is this a sign that maybe the girl I married isn’t for me.</p>

              <p>Ryan, I understand how you feel, but that usually isn’t the case. There is no perfect relationship…every marriage has its own unique set of obstacles. Many people leave their husbands or their wives because stronger feelings pull them to another relationship…but when they get to that other relationship, the majority of the time it ends very badly. We have some great tools and programs on our website for situations just like yours. Don’t give up on your marriage yet…you don’t see the train wreck that could come of it now, but we have seen it at Marriage Helper thousands of times.</p>

            <p>I have been with my wife for 17 years, and married for 10. We have a four year old son together. She is an alcoholic, pill popper, and suffers from depression. Her family sucks, and has always made her and our life very hard. We still love each other very much, but we’ve put each other through hell over the years. I fell in love with a coworker two years ago, and I’m still in love with her. She waited, and waited, and waited for me to leave my wife, and I’ve never been able to bring myself to do it, mainly because of our son. I don’t want to hurt him, and mess him up for the rest of his life! Now this other girl is finally dating someone new, and I may have lost her forever, and I’m so heartbroken I can barely function.</p>

              <p>PC, as much as it hurts, the fact that your lover moved on to someone new is probably not just because you wouldn’t leave your wife and son. She probably would have moved on to someone new even if you had. I am sorry if that seems harsh, but we have seen it time and time again. I applaud you for staying in your marriage even when you didn’t want to, and even if it was only because of your son. It may seem cliche at this point, but it is not too late to make your marriage stronger and healthier and start treating each other with respect.</p>

            <p>I am married for 23 years now, with a loving wife and 2 children..<br> 6 years before my marriage, I fell in love with a girl. It was love at first site. I used to wait for her every day, follow her upto to her college and back. She is to take a bus and go to her village 20km away. Sometimes I used to follow her upto her house on my mobike.<br> I am from India. We are from different religion/castes. I tried to talk to her, but she would’nt respond…One day I went up to her house, only to find out she was getting engaged on that day. I was totally shattered and heart broken and felt, I can never get married in my life. The time was too short, probably 2 odd months, after I saw her.<br> Some consolation was, she was to be married in a good family, so I felt happy for her. It was a hopeless situation for me caste wise, no job, no social standing, Indian social conditions, etc etc.,<br> I never saw her afterwards and also I have moved away to another place. But she stayed in my heart and she will, till I die.<br> Now in 2000, after 24 years or so, my friend called and put her on the phone. He is from her same village and married her friend (2nd marriage). I always used to think, I should somehow see her atleast once before I die and tell her, I truly loved her. But this phone call has given such happiness to me, I could not believe it. From that time, we kept in touch over the phone. Twice we have met, only to talk. She had a bad marriage, with 2 children. Her husband kind of sadist lives away. The connection is, only their property. We talk mostly about our children and my wife also.<br> She suffers from kidney stones, some health problems…she falls ill and accident prone too. I keep sending her money whenever she says, she is ill.<br> Gradually, I get a feeling, she only interested in me, because I keep sending her money and wonder if she care for my feelings…Really I don’t know…may be I am wrong.<br> Whatever, it is not possible for me to take her out of my heart, as I truly love her. I never felt that feeling with anyone and never will…I still vividly remember the place I saw her for the first time and all the places I saw her, spoke to her and everything…Whatever she says, is very important to me and I simply cannot forget.<br> I told my mother at that time when I fell in love with her and now, after I met her again. I made her to speak to my mother also… I am in different country now.<br> I keep testing myself whether it is just an infatuation or lust, but it is true love and whatever she is and whatever she does to me, even If I don’t meet her again in my life again, I love her, love her till I die..<br> I feel very guilty and painful. My wife loves me and cares for me a lot and she is emotionally attached to me. I take good care of her too and seeing her happy is my top priority. But I can’t understand and this feeling….<br> After stumbling upon these blogs, thought I would write also.<br> I really wonder if somebody is in the same strange situation and fighting like me…</p>

              <p>Pavan, many people are in your situation. You are not alone. These articles are culminated from years and years of experiences with thousands of people. And we have seen the outcome of these situations. For those that stay with their wife, they can make their marriage better than it was before. For those who leave with their lover, we have never seen that relationship make it.</p>

            <p>My situation is a little different from the previous posts in that I’m not married but I am engaged and I have a 3 year old son with another man. My son’s father and I had been friends for 7 years before we started dating and living together. Things seemed so great. We dated only a few months before we ended up pregnant. A few months after I became pregnant he kicked me out and wouldn’t talk to me or see me. We were arguing a lot so he felt that was the best solution. 8 months into the pregnancy he finally contacted me and said he wanted to be part of our childs life. At this point I had already started dating someone (my current fiance) and at this point my passion for this new man was strong (as expected in every new relationship). Also this new man has been there for me, my rock, my shoulder to cry on. Of course, like any relationship, we’ve had our share of problems. The biggest problem being that after 3 years of dating and having the marriage discussion he still hadn’t popped the question or asked my son and I to live with him. So I gave the ultimatum. He didn’t take me seriously so I I distanced myself from him for a couple of weeks. At this point he gave me a ring but his lack of proposal has always bothered me as I know the only reason he gave it to me was to pacify me (a Hail Mary if you will). I know this because I had to give him an ultimatum, distance myself, and now that we are engaged he won’t talk about the wedding or wedding plans. It’s been 6 months and we don’t even have a date set. My son and I now live in his house. The father of my child and I have gone through a really vicious custody battle, fights, and now are friends again. It took some time to get there and I lot of talking and forgiveness on both of our parts. I’ve always wondered if I should have waited for him and not moved on so quickly. I wonder if we would have worked it out and we would be the happy family I wanted. When I see my son and his father together, I am just in love. He’s so loving with our son. He’s such a great dad. I should mention that my fiancé is not great with my son. He has struggled to connect with him despite the fact that he was there for most of my pregnancy, was in the delivery room, and was with me the first 7 months of my son’s life before the father finally came around (due to custody battle the father wouldn’t see our son for quite some time just out of his own anger). My fiancé isn’t mean to my son or anything. He just doesn’t show the love, compassion or interest in my son that my son’s father does or that I’ve seen other step dads give. It really bothers me and we’ve talked about it more times than I can count. He always promises to get better but never does. I feel like a single mom living in his house as he not only doesn’t connect with my son but also rarely helps. I’ve learned to move on as he has helped with my son in other ways (mostly financial). He even paid for my custody attorney ($9000). He’s a really great person. He’s so good to me and even spoils me. He’s always loved me for who I am. He loves me unconditionally. He’s forgiving. He’s a hard worker. He was there for me when I had no one else. These and so many other reasons are why I wanted to marry him and pushed so hard to get him to propose. But now that I’ve had to push so hard I can’t help but feel less loved and this less in love with him. Actually, it makes me downright angry. I feel less attracted to him and we have almost no sex because of all of this. And yes, we’ve discussed it. He always promises to change and to do better but never follows though (not for more than a day or two anyway). I’m so sad because I feel my love fading fast for him and I feel my love for my son’s father growing. I don’t want to hurt my fiancé because he doesn’t deserve that. On the other hand, he’s not exactly trying. To make matters worse the father of my son and I got into a small arguemebt last week and he blurted out that he still loves me and wishes he hadn’t kicked me out. That he wishes that he had done things differently and that he wonders what would have happened if we had tried to work things out. He said that it bothers him that I moved on before we got the chance to find out. I was surprised that he felt this way (the same way I felt) considering the things he’s said and done during the custody battle. I assumed he hated me and was just being cordial and pretending to be friends for our child’s sake. So now here I am, engaged, unsure if my wedding day will ever come, living with a man who won’t love my son despite how important it is to me, who doesn’t want more kids even though I do, breaker of promises, man whom my love and desire for is quickly dissipating… Yet man who has always been there for me, loves me unconditionally, and who doesn’t deserve to be hurt. I’m sure a lot of women and men with children whose parent they didn’t work things out with feel something for that other parents. What I need to know is do I try to work on the issues in my current engagement and strengthen it and build it into a good marriage? If so, talking to him doesn’t work so what does a girl do to accomplish this? Or do I give my son’s father a second chance knowing that things will eventually fizzle down and that I may also find huge flaws in him and possibly regret leaving my current fiancé? I mean I already feel a sense of regret and what if in regards to my son’s father. But will it be worse when I’ve hurt my fiancé, decided that my childs father is also not for me, and then am alone wonder what of had done things differently? And most of all, I love my son and don’t want to ruin his father’s and my friendship especially since it took so long to get to this point. Because if things didn’t work out and we went head to head again, my son would suffer. I am a very emotionally aware person and I am also very open about my emotions. Even with that said, I’m unsure of how to get help and where to go from here.</p>

            <p>Hi, I’ve been married to my husband for almost 4 years and we dated for nearly 15 years before we married. I always wanted to get married but he was never ready for marriage until after I made physical changes to my body. I fell in love with someone else during one of our many break ups. Even though I married him I never let go of this other person and soon after I married my husband I started having an affair with this other man.<br> I do love my husband but now I feel like I jumped on getting married when he finally wanted to! I believe he finally wanted to marry me cause he knew I would soon be snatched by someone else with my new confidence in myself. Now I’m contemplating divorce ? I’ve become very depressed to the point I would rather take sleep aids to avoid my husband and it’s making me sick. I’m unhappy with the person he’s become in our relationship. I feel like I made a huge mistake! Is it worth considering counseling?</p>

              <p>Yes, you should definitely consider counseling and receive further help. There are many issues going on, and I would suggest that you understand what is going on with you and with your relationship before making any large decisions. We don’t do counseling, but we would like to help if we could.</p>

            <p>Six months before I took decision to marry a girl of my parents choice because I could not tell my feeling to a girl whom I liked. I wanted to move on. My marriage was fixed with the girl which my parents chose, but I wanted to delay may marriage for about six months so that we (me and the girl chosen for me) know each other better before getting married. But her parents wanted the marriage to happen as soon as possible. I don’t know why? I talked to this girl and explained my concern and what I feel. I told her that we should spend some time together before getting married. She agreed at that time but she changed her mind after one day. She and her parents wanted to marry their daughter as soon as possible. But I insisted them that we must first know each other before getting married but in vain. They also pressurized my parents for early marriage through my grand parents. During this time me and the girl whom i wanted to marry became close. We realized that we are in love with each other, but under my parents and girls parents pressure (girl chosen by my parents) i married to the girl whom I didn’t love. Now I realized that I cannot live with the girl I have married because she is not my type and I don’t love her. What should I do? Please Help.</p>

I have spoke to her every single day since we first started speaking there has not been one day we haven’t gone without messaging or calling each other she tried to end it with her bf but her bf lives under the same roof as her and she lives with her parents I have tried to tell my mind to walk away but I can’t my heart beats too fast feel like am gonna be sick feels like someone has my insides and they are pulling them out. Every day I wake up I wish I am near her I get this feeling in my Adam’s apple when I try to tell her stuff like someone’s grabbing my throat the pain I have been mentally into this year is terrible I haven’t stopped fighting for her everyday because I no my future will be rubbish without her I would marry her tomorrow if I could she has the most softest lips ever and the most beautiful eyes I just want to be with her</p>

              <p>James, what you are describing are definitely signs of limerence. You didn’t mention whether or not she is married or if you are married. I suggest that you look at some of the articles on the website about limerence.</p>

            <p>I’ve been with my husband for almost two years now. We only knew each other for about 6 months before we got married. I do love him and I know he would do anything for me but there’s something missing. The sex isn’t as romantic as it use to be and some days I just really don’t want to spend time with him. I look forward to going to work so I can spend time without him. But, about 2 months ago I met this guy that comes into my work everyday, a few times a day and he’ll even stick around while I close at night. And that just leaves me and him, alone, in a somewhat dark building. At first I thought it was sweet and i felt safe with him there but then we started flirting and now all I can think about is being with him. I look forward to going to work bc I know I’ll see him. And at the end of the night I hate to leave him. I know I don’t love him but I know there’s something there. Maybe it’s the fact that it’s something I can’t have? But my husband is no longer the guy I think about when I go to bed or the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning. It’s the other guy. This other guy makes me so nervous, in a good way. I stumble over my words, I get butterflies every time he walks through the door and I just have the biggest smile on my face when he’s around. If I’m having a bad night, just seeing him for a minute turns everything around.<br> We’ve talked about all of this and he says he feels the same way. But nothing can happen bc I’m married and he is in a relationship. I just wish this feeling would go away. And when I find out that he isn’t working the next two or three days I get disappointed but relieved at the same time bc I think since I won’t see him for a few days then these feelings will probably subside but they never do. They seem to only get stronger. I haven’t felt like this since I believe I was in high school. I don’t even think I was like this when my husband and I first met.<br> Please, can you give me some kind of advice as to what to do? Like I said, I love my husband but did we get married too quickly? Sometimes I think that maybe I just settled bc I’m almost 27 and I feel like I was wasting time being single? I just don’t know anymore.</p>

            <p>I met someone 4 years now. We both worked at the same company however everything you would want in a man he does. We both fell in love however he is married for two yrs &amp; with his wife for 8 yrs.. They have rough roads &amp; he is currently thinking of a divorce.<br> You see our goals in life are the same career, family wise, business wise &amp; love life.. However his wife &amp; him are on opposite paths. He is breaking it slowly to his wife about a divorce however I am wondering if i am doing the correct thing. I would not want to wreck someone home to build mine.</p>

              <p>Anna,</p> 
              <p>There are a couple of things going on here. First of all, the fact that you are questioning your relationship with this man shows that you realize that what is happening should not be happening. Since you have read this article, you have some sense of what limerence is and how it works. It eventually fades, and all of the people in the path of the disaster are devastated by what happened. Also, if he is wanting to leave his wife when things get hard, then that gives a pretty good indication that he would do the same thing with you. </p> 
              <p>You already know that you would have to live with the guilt and the downfall of his marriage. It isn’t worth it.</p>

            <p>I’m having an affair with my bestfriend who is married, making me the other woman. We were falling for each other before they were married but nuerther of us spoke up. They have been married for 5 months and we’ve been together for 3. I know the devastation behind cheating as I have been on the other side. I also know that he is a good person and if or when eventually faced with the consequences of this how damaging it could be to him. He says all the time he should’ve never gotten married but I know he obviously did for a reason. I go back and forth constantly but just looking for confirmation that the right thing to do in his best interest is to end things before any permanent damage is done and let his marriage take the path it’s meant to without interference. Any feed back is greatly appreciated.</p>

              <p>Kat,</p> 
              <p>I think that deep inside you know that this relationship isn’t right. He did decide to go into his marriage, and he made a commitment to his wife. His continuing in this affair will eventually deeply hurt his marriage and have very negative effects for years to come. The best thing that you could do at this point is end the relationship. It will not only be helpful for him, but it will benefit you greatly in the long run. Deep inside, you don’t want to be that other woman. And you deserve more than that. You deserve a relationship with a man who is committed to you and only you. If we can help you with any more of this, please contact us.</p>

            <p>My wife started having an affair 6 months ago. I didnt find out til november that it wasnt just a friendship. There were so many lies it was insane. She tried to leave me without me knowing about it or finding out which cause me to look at the way ive been acting for the entire 9 years of marriage triggering real changes in me emtionally. We have a 3 year old boy and my beliefs of having a strong household are even more strong than ever. She pretty much bailed out of our marriage and blames me for her coworker affair. I have been pleading to work things out and gave her forgiveness which is probably the wrong way of trying to save our marriage. Whats even worse is that all her anger and hatred for me became too intense and I moved to another state with family to try to get my mind together. Now that im doing alright but not good. she does not want a future with me. She is no longer seeing or talking to the other guy. She says she wants nothing to do with either of us which sounds crazy to me since im the one who has been married to her for 9 years and have a child with her. All I want to do is work my way back into her heart and prove myself I am indeed a different man. Even more difficult is her and my side of the family know everything which reinforces her desicion. I am extremely lost and have no idea what to do anymore. I recently voiced that it was wrong for her to put me in the same category as the other guy cause it was not my fault. Other day she texted me asking if I was alright. I am super confused and all I want to do is tell her how much I love her but I know thats stepping backwards. I need help</p>

              <p>Oscar, while pleading does not work, giving forgiveness and reminding your spouse of your love for her is a good thing to do. We actually have a whole video series called Marriage Recovery that goes step by step through exactly what to do when your spouse has been involved in an affair but wants out of the marriage. It is extremely helpful and gives detailed advice.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p> 
            <p>Reading all the comments has been extremely useful, thank you for that already. Hope you can provide some advice for my case as well. </p> 
            <p>I am not yet married, but am thinking about doing it with my bf. He loves me a lot and sees the rest of our lives together. He would like to have kids, etc. I like him very rationally – he is my age, liked by my parents &amp; friends, earns similarly as I and is from very similar background. All in all, rationally thinking, I have never met someone who would make such a logical match for me. As for my feelings – I like him and that’s it. I know how romances go away and don’t find it necessary to love the person I’m going to marry. Sex is average, yet everything is stable – I know that it shouldnt get worse. There has been no change in my attitude for several years already.</p> 
            <p>On the other hand, there is another guy, which I have known for a bit longer and have romantic feelings towards to. We have more things in common (hobbies/look on life, etc.), have always had great sex, none of us wants kids and we very much enjoy each others company. We were together for a year and still meet from time to time. He is single (divorced years ago). Yet the problem with him is that I never made the relationship wih him known to anyone due to rather sure feeling that the relationship wouldn’t be accepted from my relatives/society in general – he is 17 years older. He also earns substantially more than I do (I earn a very good salary, but he is a CEO, so the difference is huge), so that may also inevitably make some think that I’m with him for money. </p> 
            <p>So in the end I am continuing my life on the rational path, yet I end up thinking a lot about two topics. The first one – should I completely cut out the second guy from my life? I end up feeling very dull and a bit sad when I haven’t seen him for months, not really missing sex as much as missing our talks. And the second problem – I dread the moment when I will have to admit to my bf (or husband already) that I don’t want to have kids in the end. For this I’m just hoping that my attitude may change, as I’m still very young (27 years).</p>

              <p>Katie, there are a couple of things to think about here. From your post, I cannot tell if you have been seeing the second man while also dating your boyfriend. However, if you are not satisfied with your relationship with your boyfriend now, it will not change by marrying. In fact, at times in marriage, things will seem worse. Conflict will come. Sex will become stagnant. Marriage takes work – and if you are already second guessing the marriage, or entering into it without being completely honest with your future spouse, it will only make things worse in the marriage (and let’s face it, we don’t need to make marriage any harder than it can be!). However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the relationship with the other man would be the right choice. You already mentioned some concerns you have, and it could be that you are in limerence with that man. I would advise to start by being honest with your boyfriend, talk openly about the issues present, and see what happens from there.</p>

            <p>Hello:</p> 
            <p>I have been married for 21 1/2 years. 4 months ago, I met someone at work and we hit it off right away. Talk all the time. It has escalated into the 2 of us “cuddling” at her house at least twice a week. We have never had sex, but we lay together, naked, in her bed and we do everything else except for sex. She says she doesn’t want to because I’m still married. I accept that. I want it bad and I believe she does too. Here’s a wrench in this whole situation? She has a divorced, single “close friend” that she does have sex with. Hmm? She has told me that she wants to be married again as soon as possible, but she’s in no hurry. Mixed messages here? I am in love with her, but she only likes me right now. Sometimes I want to break it off and sometimes I want to get a divorce and be with her. Then, I would have to join the Mormon church. So confused.</p>

              <p>The signs that she is giving definitely point to her not being serious about a relationship with you. Even if you divorced your wife to be with her, the odds are stacked that she still would not marry you. That’s the thing about limerence: it thrives when people are not together. Once the uncertainty of whether or not they can be together, they start seeing all of the issues with the relationship and it inevitably ends. The fact that she is sleeping with another man also shows that she is not interested in a relationship. There are many things to consider before putting 21 years of marriage aside.</p>

            <p>Hello.</p> 
            <p>I’ve been married for a year and a half to my husband. The firate few months went wonderfully then all of a sudden everything just started falling apart. A few months ago I met a guy who i worked with. He was sweet and kind and he became my best friend but now I’ve noticed that this strong friendship we’ve created has blossomed into love. I do care for my husband still but I can’t shake this feeling I’m just keeping him from happiness. I just don’t know what to do.</p>

              <p>What you are probably experiencing is the fading of “newness” and feelings of exciting love that you had with your spouse in the beginning, and those feelings are being replaced by the new feelings from this man. The truth is every relationship takes work. You are probably experiencing the beginnings of limerence with this man at work…which <strong>will</strong> eventually fade. That is why commitment and continually working on your marriage is so important…and takes work. If you want to avoid a lot of heartache, it would be best to stop spending anytime with this other man. In fact, it would be best to change jobs to avoid any and all temptation. Work on your marriage before things get worse.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p> 
            <p>I’ve been married for almost 3 years, me and my husband had what I thought was the perfect marriage. He was amazing, caring, a wonderful father to our child. But something was missing. I got promoted at work and went to another location to train. Where I had met someone. we talked and got to know each other we exchanged phone numbers.. And one thing led to another. I ended up having an affair, this affair has lasted almost 8 months. We have fallen so hard for each other there is so much passion and romance with this guy that I don’t have with my husband. I’m so completely torn between both guys. I don’t want to give up on my marriage but I don’t want to stop seeing this other guy either.</p>

            <p>Hi, i have been in a relationship for about 5 months now. I am married and so is he. We both have kids. We have both been married for many years. I do love this person and I feel he loves me as well. Neither one of us want to hurt our spouse , children, or family. All of this is completely against what I stand for and I can’t seem to grasp how this happened. I do know that my spouse has been very rude and hateful to me for the last several years. We went months maybe even years with no I love you. I really felt his love for me was gone. I feel this had something to do with my decision to have this affair. Now I love this other man and have no idea where to go from here.</p>

First, I would suggest you start by downloading this free e-book titled “How to Choose Between Lover and Spouse”. You can download that here: <a href="http://my.marriagehelper.com/decision-point-ebook/" rel="nofollow">http://my.marriagehelper.com/decision-point-ebook/</a></p>

            <p>Hi I’ve been married for 6 years .. im really unhappy he mentally cuts me down .. it’s like he gets off on making me cry . I hate him he has put his hands on me 4 times . I sometimes think its because he was drunk then. But emotionally we have no connection.. i think its funny because hes a great father he treats the boys well me not so much … before we got married he cheated on me . I should of know if he made me cry then he’ll do it now .. the only thing that keeps me here is my kids sadly reminds me of my mother she did the same thing. And it was just me then.. anyway i met a guy about around aug. When school started for the kids . We both have kids that ride the bus too school and back home . We would say hi talk .. but at the time i had no interest i was trying keep my marriage together… but it seems im never good enough or do anything right.. so i spoke to a friend about it … one day he forgot his wallet and came back to get it our youngest saw it was daddy and ran to him he got out the car and said you stupid bitch our son could got killed.. then on ppl know how he treats me. So anyway my friend talk to the guy that i sometimes speak to find out he has been interested in for a while .. anyway he knows how he treats me he tells me i deserve better that he would treAt better well. Ive been seeing him since beginning of December.. im so happy when I’m with him the kids love him.. and he loves them .also.. i was already planning to leave him before me this guy started talking.. ive asked for marriage counseling hes refuses says its my fault… anyway thats my story.. i just want to be loved and happy .. and my kids to be ok as well.</p>

              <p>Nicole,</p> 
              <p>If you took the other man out of the picture, as if you had never met, then do you believe your marriage is salvageable? If so, then you need to work on your marriage. I know there is a lot of hurt and pain that has caused you to think negatively about him, but people who are in love with someone else also tend to rewrite history. If you are rewriting history, then you could be making a huge mistake. If your husband is genuinely a good man doing a bad thing, then this can work. If you need help figuring that out, then I highly suggest you check out this ebook on how to choose between lover and spouse: <a href="http://my.marriagehelper.com/decision-point-ebook/" rel="nofollow">http://my.marriagehelper.com/decision-point-ebook/</a></p>

                <p>Im in a similar situation. But im the lover. Everyone who knows this woman knows that her marriage has been toxic almost the full 10 yrs they have been together. As a matter of fact. He was actually still married to his last wife when he married her. Hes very controlling, untrusting, and isolates her from everyone including her family. When she started pursuing me 6 months ago she told me shes been planning divorce for a while just looking for the right time cuz for a while he wouldn’t let her work so she couldn’t make it on her own. We started dating against my better judgement. We moved in together and both of us were the happiest wed ever been. We both got all the attention that we never had from anyone in past relationships and we were in love. Her 2 children were even happy. Then over the past few months something would hit her and shed wonder if she was doing the right thing. Theyd try to fix it and id step out but it never lasted more than 3 days and wed be back together. I want to believe it’s for the kids. Anyway, 3 weeks ago they decided that they were gonna really try hard one last time. She left me he left his new gf and now hes more controlling and isolating than ever. She has to be on the phone 24/7 when they aren’t together and he tracks her gps on the phone. Well last week we had found a way to meet before work and had sex almost everyday. She said she knew they weren’t going to work but I needed to give her time to settle things with him and she would fix it with us. But she wasnt going to ask me to wait. I finally became impatient and upset with being on the side and having to sneak around and got angry and threatened to tell him. That’s when she told me to just move on. The thing is I know in a couple weeks shell be missing me again. And I really don’t expect them to even last much longer than that. I am at the point where im starting to believe it is time though. As much as it hurts. I should’ve just stayed away until they were completely through</p>

                <p>I forgot to mention that the divorce is already in process. They were about to go to mediation but she put in on 3 month hold to try to work it out. He wanted her to call it off all together and I believe only so he wouldn’t have to pay child support for two more of his kids. (He has 5 altogether)</p>

            <p>Hey, my name is Bianca I am 24 and I got married June 13, w<br> 2014. It has not been great. My husband is back in jail and seems to me he doesn’t wanna take responsibility for his actions, although when we met he was awesome then it went away fights came and he does the most sometimes. I thought I really wanted a Thug for a man but I guess I am cheating myself. I met this guy he has a good heart he goes to church, he does not get in trouble he chooses the right rode… We just met but It seem like I been knowing him forever. My husband might go crazy if he found out but idk what to do anymore I love my husband but I am afraid I am gonna get the same results when he come home….</p>

              <p>Elly, Before you leave your marriage for this other man, I hope that you make sure you are not just leaving your marriage and replacing it with something instead of working out your problems. Otherwise, you will eventually face problems with this new guy, and when that happens, what are you going to do? Are you going to leave him, or try and work it out?</p>

            <p>I am in love with a married man who is 15 years my senior. I am single. We have been in a relationship for almost 2 years. He gets the best of both worlds. Me, his young, fun, exciting, sexy and engaging girlfriend and the wife who has been with him for 25 years but is old, boring and frumpy however she is stable and secure and he knows what to expect from her. He has strong feelings for me. In fact I do believe we love each other. However, he is afraid to leave the comfort and security of his long term marriage for me. I am still considered a risk for him even though he loves me. He is afraid to walk away from her. Afraid to change his life, especially nearing his retirement years. He is also afraid to destroy his family unit.. especially the impact it might have on his close relationship with his grand children. So he has continued to live a double life and it has been stressful for him… and for me. As you can imagine, having these feelings and wanting to be with each other but knowing it will never go anywhere… is hard. It is heart breaking. It is this endless roller coaster ride of getting close and then pulling away. It is the most joy and euphoria I have ever felt and yet sometimes the deepest pain and most lonely I have ever been. We cannot let each other go. He has walked away from me three times already only to come back. I think it is almost like an addiction. We are addicted to the feelings we get from each other and the incredible sex is just a by product of the chemistry we share. We always ask each other if we did go legit, if that chemistry would eventually fade in the light of real life. So here we are doing our best carrying on in this fantasy where we each get the best of each other. The feelings are so intense and over whelming and to go from that high to the pain of having to let that go is impossible. From euphoria to emptiness. From all encompassing happiness and elation to the depths of despair? You can see why so many hang on to their affair partner for dear life. Sometimes you just cannot walk away from a marriage, despite your feelings for a new person. I do believe sometimes that new person is meant to be with you. Not all marriages are salvageable or meant to be worked on into the ground without any progress. No marriage should be a prison sentence. Sometimes you do need to leave and start over and things do work themselves out under the right circumstances. I do believe that. It is sad and sweet all at once. He makes me feel alive and vise versa. I just cannot say good bye to him and if he ever did, I would be destroyed.</p>

            <p>I have been married for 4 years. We were separated for 5 months, we never talked during that time other than texts and it was only when he was asking if I had filed for divorce or if I had changed utilities, etc out of his name. I was dating someone during those 5 months. I never cheated on my husband. He came over to get some items and all the sudden was wanting to get back together telling me how much he loved me and he never wanted to get divorced. I was so shocked I let him move back home the next day! He’s been home for 2 months now and I have realized I am not only in love with the guy I was dating but the spark truly is gone in my marriage. When I tell him I think we moved in to fast it breaks my heart to see that it hurts him to hear that. He seems to be a new person. We separated due to his verbal abuse and intense anger. During separation he was talking to his ex wife and an old girl friend. I feel like he has always had them on stand by and I can’t get past that. I don’t know if he still talks to them, I’m scared to ask because then he’ll ask me if I’m talking to the guy I dated and the answer is yes I am. I wish he would tell me he wants to leave but at the same time I think I should be honest, put my feeling sorry for him aside and tell him to move out. I do love him, but prior to separation the marriage was always rocky and now it just seems like something is missing. I think about this other guy all the time, we talk everyday and he knows the situation with my marriage. I just feel stuck</p>

            <p>I have been married for four years. Me and my husband are from two different cultures. We have been facing problems adjusting for last 6-7 months and things have got quiet worst between us. In the meantime, I have reconnected with this guy whom i met after my engagement with my husband. We fell in love but I still married my husband due to social obligations (In our culture, breaking off an engagement is a big deal!). The guy was so madly in love with me till last year that he would want me to leave my husband and go to him. He told me many times to get divorced and marry him since he was still waiting for us to be together.I tried but never had the courage to break off my marriage because i thought it would be unfair to my husband. But now when my marriage is going through a rocky road, I want to leave him and be with that guy. I dont know if that would be a wise decision or if he would ever marry me or not. Im going through a depression. please help!</p>

            <p>I have been married for 12 years and together with my spouse for coming up on 19 years… we have had up and down moments through out our entire relationship..it seems as though one of us was always doing something to sabotage our marriage in one form or fashion and at different intervals one has wanted to leave the other stay.. then switch… I loved my spouse at one point but we never had that bond. she loves me still but there hasn’t been a togetherness ever. I cannot blame either one of us for the demise of our life together but at about the 7th year we found a moment and married we gave it a real good go, however my spouse held resentments towards me lasting somewhere around 4 years after getting married. I felt during that time my penances had been paid ..but my wife just seemed to keep me at arms length in every fashion and never really came back to the relationship … we spoke on this many occasions even sought counsel through our church at which point i was absolutely done and full of resentments to even consider reconciliation .. I gave up. we have children only one left in the house… we live completely separate lives we have no physical relationship whatsoever, separated but living under the same roof… on my side I had no partner ,no friend nor her from me any longer.. we didn’t like the same things ..I began to seek comfort elsewhere.. i was rejected and disrespected and ultimately found it with a woman I never saw coming .. we are compatible like I’ve never experienced before in my life …this woman and I crossed the line about three years into the turmoil I found myself in and have had a relationship for over 5 years… it has been tumultuous at times and we’ve experienced everything the “other woman” could go through emotionally…we took the plunge and both know it should have been done differently .. but it just happened .. we knew each other casually for 2 years prior… we found ourselves immediately in love and still remain… I have had all the guilt a man can experience and so has she for all obvious reasons… .. I know this all would affect my spouse and family negatively obviously, I remained in this for so long thinking about my child…but I am ready to move on to the next level “divorce”… I am a man that doesn’t want to hurt anyone including my spouse but we haven’t been in a marriage since long before I began a strong intense love affair… I know my spouse doesn’t want to divorce but neither of us are happy in this situation.. my spouse and I have had no physical contact in approx. 8 years .. I have lived on the couch for at least 5 years… we don’t fight but things are completely out of whack. we do nothing together and have not other than church and that is where it had completely fallen apart.. I need help I have no where to turn .. I found this site and read all your stories.. every story broke my heart in one form or fashion … I am ready to make the step out but have no idea of how or what to do to have a collaborative divorce.. I am desperate … Everyone is hurting and I am at the center of it all.. “the cause”. i need help… my apologies for being so long winded</p>

            <p>This article says most people don’t mean for it to happen. So what if someone deliberately sought that person out? What if they’ve had multiple affairs and been engaged in some online chat rooms asking for hook ups to have more sex? I have a feeling he’s bipolar. His father is. Now his dad is in prison because he molested one of my children about a year ago. I have asked him to be evaluated for bipolar which he agrees to even thought he doesn’t think I’m right. I’m willing to try and work on this one more time because there’s so much invested in this marriage. Four children one of whom has special needs. He says he will try also. However I am concerned he has personal mental health issues that need to be dealt with. Also, I must admit I feel skeptical that the marriage can be saved. We have been married for 14 years and I first caught him soliciting sex online twelve years ago after our first child was born. He has had two affairs in the last four years. I also have been concerned at times that his sexual behavior seems obsessive and that his use of pornography borders on extreme.</p>

            <p>I’ve been married for almost 22 years. Two thirds of those years my wife has been sick both physically and emotionally. We have two kids, both with some degree of disability.<br> My wife depends on me 200% and Inhave always been there as a friend, provider, dad-mom, housekeeper, etc.<br> I know I love my wife but now that love is not the romantic kind of love. It is the love “filial”love that I can feel for a close family member. I take care of her and my kids on all they need.<br> Now: About 6 years ago I crossed roads with my high school deep love, she is married as well but after 6 years of conversations and 2 years since we got intimate I’m convinced I’m madly in love with her. I have tried to shut her down multiple times, to stop all communication but it is hell. it is now six years that think about her everyday, feeling like a inexperienced 15 years old. ( I’m 47 …)<br> I want to finish this because I know I must stay and be a provider for my wife and kids but I feel I’m throwing away true happiness. When I’m with the “other” woman I feel peace, clarity, fulfillment.<br> Responsibility vs happiness….<br> This sucking out my energy and desire to live.</p> 
            <p>Advice ?</p>

              <p>Here’s the thing about feelings: they always change. True love is a decision, not a feeling. Love that won’t last is based on what you feel would make you happy in that moment. If you leave your ill wife and children to be with someone else because you were focused on what would make you happy, it a few weeks, a few months, or maybe a few years, you would look back and deeply regret your decision. You see, you are in limerence. It’s only attractive because the other person is “hard to get”. Once you have “gotten” her, it will fade…and you won’t feel happy with her either. You know what the right thing is to do. A man should take care of his family, especially in their time of need. If the feelings of love are gone, that’s not a problem. We know how to rebuild love and help you fall in love all over again with your spouse.</p>

            <p>What if the person you’ve fallen in love with is the right one? I see a lot of advice here about how to make your marriage work but what if the feelings are long gone and your only there because of your belief systems. I saw my parents in a loveless relationship for 32 years, it had more of an impact on me seeing them together when they obviously didn’t want to be. Please help, really confused</p>

              <p>Love can fade, but that doesn’t mean you should just move on. The love will fade with the new person over time. Love will always fade if people don’t do the things it takes to keep it alive. You can fall in love with your spouse again and make it right. Yes, it will take work. Yes, it is a commitment and a decision, not a feeling. But it is worth it.</p>

            <p>I’m a 37 year old father of tho small kids. I’ve been married now for 11 years.<br> Problem 1: I was never intensely in love with my wife. I love her very much, but it was more circumstances and religious/social/family pressure that brought us together 11 years ago.<br> Problem 2: I am bisexual. I’ve always known this from a very young age, but chose to conform due to obvious reasons.<br> Problem 3: My wife had a weight problem since before I met her, promised me that she would do something about it, but did nothing for 9 of the 11 years. I worked very hard in the beginning couple of years to look past my own needs and just love her, but eventually started to feel betrayed, and that she did not love me enough to change as promised. So for years I functioned like a robot – knew how to act, what to say, how to smile, but this was all programmed behavior. Something in me just started to die.<br> I got lost in porn and started meeting guys online to fill the sexual void in me.<br> I eventually met a guy online, that was in the exact same position as me. this was an awesome find – at last someone who understands, felt the same way, someone to talk to, so our friendship grew naturally. right from the start we expressed the same needs, and due to this decided to keep our relationship exclusive and stop with the casual encounters.<br> It caught both of us totally off guard, but we are now deeply in love. Its like “being in love”, “love” and “lust” are finally present in one place (as I believe it should be…). We have been seeing each other now for the last year. </p> 
            <p>I’m not sure why I am writing this post…. the only reason I am staying in this marriage is because of my kids, and I can’t bear the thought at this stage to loose my family….</p> 
            <p>I don’t know how to revive what has died in me, and frankly, I am not sure if I want to revive/reprogram it….</p> 
            <p>He does not have kids, and is in the process of divorcing his wife – they have drifted appart over the yaers as well. And so far we have agreed that I will stay in my marriage for my kids, for as long as I need to, even if it is for the next 15-20 years.</p> 
            <p>there is no easy solution to this. Do I have the right to be happy too? I have always sacrificed my own happiness for others. Where do I draw the line? I do not want to hurt my kids….</p>

            <p>I have have been married almost 4 years now. We have had some ups and downs in our marriage, but who doesn’t. I can honestly say I have tried. My husband is pretty good for the most part but has some emotional / controlling issues. But there is a persons who has been in and out of my life since I was 10… He’s always been there..a lot of history, emotionally and sexually. He has come back into my life and I truly believe that we are soul mates..I love him and want to be with him and he feels the same. But he as well has issues.. And I am married.. I dunno what to do. I am unhappy where I’m at and dunno how to tell my Husband</p>

            <p>Well I have been bitten by this bug too. I have been married for at least 16 years and we have had a rocky marriage the whole time. We have 2 children 13 and 6. There is a girl that I will keep nameless but she and I have known each other for the last 2 years. We have started slow with building a friendship and in that time we have grown to love each other. We have not been intimate with each other but that feeling is growing stronger as days pass. She is also married and she has the same kind of relationship and we are both not happy with our current lives. </p> 
            <p>We get to see each other 2-3 days a week and we enjoy each others company. We relate to each other and can hold conversations that are meaning full. We both are wanting more but we respect that we are both married and it would cause major problems. I don’t want to be the cause for hurting her and her family and she is the same for me. She don’t want to be the reason and I don’t want to be the reason. We are falling for each other every day and their is not a day that goes by that we don’t talk even if it is just for a little bit.</p> 
            <p>Thanks for your time.</p>

              <p>Stop all contact immediately. While you may not see all of the negative consequences that can occur from this, we deal with people who have destroyed their lives every month at our Marriage Helper 911 workshop by doing this. I am sure that they would all tell you the exact same thing. The fact that you already have doubts about it on this side of things shows that you know it is wrong and you shouldn’t do it. Don’t. Think about your children. You can make the love grow back with your wife (and we can help you do that), but you can never undo the damage that you will cause your children. Quit your job. Delete every method of contacting this woman.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p> 
            <p>I am married for the past 6 years. I got married at a very young age.I am 27 years old now. I had a guy friend for the past 10 years, i feel that my guy friend is in love with me and lately i do feel the same. I want to talk with him and spend time with him all the time and dont even know if i really love him. I truly feel that he understands me better than anybody else does. My husband and me have many issues and he is really trying to work hard on our relationship. I feel confused for my feelings towards my guy friend. but at the same time i also feel like i dont love my husband anymore. My husband did a lot of things that really upset me, in the first few years of marriage i was deeply in love with him and i always thought he was the only person who can keep me happy but i was wrong. I am not happy now. I have a 3 year old kid. I am really worried about her. I dont want to end my marriage. I dont think i love my guy friend also maybe its a crush and to be honest, i cannot imagine having physical relationship with him because he is such a good friend. i am only scared about the connection that we both share.<br> Please help me . I am worried and confused.</p>

            <p>I have been married to my husband for 7 years and 2 little boys. A year ago I realized that I don’t love my husband anymore, and I don’t wanna be intimate with him anymore. He is a very good man, the only thing i don’t like with is he is a momma’s boy, immature, mumbles a lot, and doesn’t do things around the house that a man should do. He doesn’t give me money so I could budget everything for our needs. He’s always depending on his mom. I never cheated on him until 1 month ago. I didn’t cheat my hubby because I’m hurt, but I cheated him because I love the new guy. I feel loved and appreciated. He listens to me in everything and always ask permission to me whether he wants to hug me or kiss me.<br> I told my hubby, i don’t love him anymore and i have another lover, but I didn’t see any action from him except his sad face. I know i hurt him so bad we cried together when I told him the truth, but that’s it he’s sad and hurt but no action, no conversation whether he wants me to stay or not. I’m determine to move out next month.</p>

            <p>I have been married for 5 yrs now… been with my wife a total of 7 yrs and we 7 yr old twins. Lets just say the twins where not planned. about 5 yrs ago I reconnected with a ex girlfriend I used to date back when I was 13. She was married at the time to but we started to hook up. We where in different states but i fell absolutely in love with her. We are across the country from each other and and in the last 4 yrs maybe have seen each other a hand full of times. There has not been a day that goes by that I dont think of her and her of me. My wife is amazing but I just dont have the love for her that she has for me. I have a great life but still feel like what if I left and started a life with this other person. She is divorced now. The thing is we are across the country from each other so who knows if it would work but I feel if I didnt try I might have missed something special.. I am stuck…</p>

            <p>I’ve been married 4 years now we have a 1.5 yr old daughter. When I was 14, I met my guy best friend. He was always in love with me but I could never get myself to do the same. Throughout my relationships, he watched me and waited patiently for me to someday notice him. I decided to give it a try when I was 22 but did not start a relationship. When he left to the military, I met my husband. I though I was happy until I noticed I keep comparing my husband to my best friend I let go. Lack of my husband’s appreciation, support, communication, help, etc finally got to me. I started to think of my lost best friend and started to talk to him again. I confessed my love for him and surprisingly he still loves me. However, he and I agree that I should work on my marriage before making any decisions. My husband found out I was talking to him and we talked, I apologized. My husband has 2 weeks now that he has made wonderful changes. The only problem is that I still can’t get my best friend out of my head! I always think about him and how I should have married him because he is perfect in every way. It’s driving me crazy. I love two men at once.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p> 
            <p>I have been married for 6 years been together for 9. I recently found someone outside my marriage. I never thought this would happen but I feel like I’m deeply in love with this person. we share things in common my wife and I never have and have been feeling this way for almost 8 months about eachother now. I have been debating ending my marriage and presueing this new person cause I feel like I love them more than I have ever loved anyone else almost like I’m in love for real for the first time. I’m very scared and not sure what to do. I don’t want to hurt my wife. I love her but feel I’m no longer in love. I’ve said I love you to the new person and it feels very real. I hope you may be able to open my eyes to things I may be blind to and maybe help me figure this thing out. I feel very torn. my heart is pulling my out of my marriage but I want it to be real. thanks for taking the time to read this. I look forward to your comment.</p>

            <p>I married my husband because I was pregnant. I never was in love with him. After twenty-two years i asked for a divorce. I later met a married man and we are falling deeply in love.

            <p>It is kind of nice to see that I am not the only one out there struggling. </p> 
            <p>I met my husband when I was 14 (he was 17). We fell deeply and madly in love. Due to immaturity and youth it ended after 2 years. We reconnected as friends while I was in college, started dating again when I was 21, got engaged 3 months later and got married at 23. We have now been married for 8 years. 3 years ago we hit a very rough patch, I saw no hope in sight but agreed to go to counseling. About a year into counseling (over two years ago) I met a man while out on a girls weekend away from home. We hit it off, it was natural, emotional relationship that has now turned physical. We both have tried to stop communication and failed miserably. My husband and I during this time have gone through therapy and things have really improved in my marriage… So much that after 5 years of trying, we have a son now (not really planned, we kind of gave up on getting pregnant). My husband has turned into a wonderful provider, father, helps around the house and even make extra steps to check in with my happiness. Most of our sexual issues have been addressed and now we talk openly about stuff.</p> 
            <p>But I just don’t seem to be able to let this guy go. The only missing thing I see the “other” guy fulfilling is passion, he stimulates me intellectually, challenges me and inspires me to be a better person.</p> 
            <p>I have started to have the scary feeling that I married my husband because of memories of how passionate our relationship in high school was and now that we are adults it is like a really nice friendship, partnership, or even more disturbing as brother/sister relationship. My relationship with my husband in high school fulfills all of the feelings you stated in your article.</p> 
            <p>•“I’ve never been loved like this.”<br> •“No one understands me as well as he/she does.”<br> •“This is the person I was meant to be with.”<br> •“I can’t explain how this feels because I don’t think anyone else can understand it. It’s intense. Amazing. Wonderful.”</p> 
            <p>I am not even sure what my question is to you… I know that the “other” guy will probably have just as many flaws and will end up being a horrible mistake just like predicted in the article above. But for some reason I love him… and I knew it the first moment I saw him.</p>

            <p>Six months ago, my husband betrayed me. I was very sad, I cried everyday, and asked God to help me. God heard my prayer, he broke off relations with that woman. But his heart did not come back, he said wanted to be single, not marriage. I am very disappointed for him, I do not feel loved, often I feel very lonely. So I started chatting with a man, we chat every day, and sometimes meet for coffee, we do not have any physical contact, because I know that my conscience will not let me do that, also have god’word in my head: “Do not be follow this world. “I also do it to keep away from him, but I found myself really enjoyed chatting with him, and could not leave him. I have no children with my husband, my husband indifference to me, how can I do? should I divorce?</p>

            <p>Hi! I’m 25 and married for 9 months (yeah, I know). I never had a boyfriend before that (I wanted my first to be my last) and believed love is more of a knowledge, a decision rather than feelings. Well, I got introduced to a guy. Got engaged after a week (long story). I wasn’t in love but I was convinced we were good and feelings will come after. A month after I met another guy at work. He fall for me not knowing I was engaged. I thought he knew because everyone there did and I wore a ring. I apologized and we decided to remain friends but we fall in love so much with each other instead. Despite that, I went through with the wedding a year and 3 months after I was engaged. In my calculations, it was a crush and we had many differences including faith so it would never work out in the long term. It has been 2 years now. I quit my job 5 months ago just to stay away. It didn’t work. I don’t hate my husband but I’m not in love with him. I don’t know if he loves me but he’s a good person. I don’t want to point out my husband’s shortcomings here because I don’t want to justify my mistake. I know cheating is wrong no matter what. This guy loves me not in words but in action. I don’t mean kissing and stuff but he’s always there for me. He takes care of me. He puts me first. He respects me. He listens to me and understands me. He’s patient with me. He has given up opportunities to be near me and yes we fight a lot. I love him so much. I’m still with him although my conscious is tearing me apart. I even tried to commit suicide once last year with a fail. I can’t see a way out. Please help.</p>

            <p>I have been married to my husband for almost 25 years. We got married two weeks after I turned 18. It has all been a rough and Rocky marriage but I always stuck through for the kids. We have a total of 7. Problem is I am in love with someone I met four years ago. We have seen each other many times through those 4 years and he is constantly on my mind. I have never felt this way about anyone including my husband. The love of my life has expressed that he doesn’t ever want to get remarried is afraid to love again from past hurts. I feel like I am in a place in my life where I should have life figured out but this is honestly the most confusing time in my life. I don’t want to lose what I have with my kids and I am afraid of them keeping my grandkids from me if I leave their dad. Oh and how i met this guy was my husband decided we should have an open marriage. I agreed since things were bad anyways. My love came into my work and the moment i seen him i wanted to talk to him and i invited him out with a group of us for drinks. Not knowing if he was coming or not but when he showed up it was the happiest ay of my life. Please any advise would be great.</p>

            <p>I have been married to my wife for 7 years and have been together for 17 years. We have gone through many ups and downs. Have separated in 2007 for 6 months and have had about 5 other short separations. I am now 41 years old, as is my wife. 3 years ago I met a young 20 year old girl and what started out as an affair has now grown into something deep. I am in love with this woman. She is very independent, always there for me, supports me in my hobby and my job, lifts me up when I am down, makes me weak in the knees when around me and always puts a smile on my face. She is a 35 year old trapped in a 23 year old body. She has always been understanding toward my marriage and has never interfered with it. She has fallen in love with me as well and it just feels as if she makes me feel young again. I have a hobby in the nightclub industry which allows me to be out of my home at night many times throughout the month so i use any excuse I can to spend time with this other woman. My wife has been the perfect woman and loves me like no other, but my feelings are not mutual as I have gone a different path than she has. I guess I am 41 going on 31. Physically and mentally (although I attend to my responsibilities). My fear of hurting my family and friends is truly the only thing that has kept me at home, but this is really taking a toll on me emotionally. I am miserable without her and feel as if I could be missing out on the love I deserve and so is my wife. After reading this article I am now very confused. Hope I can get a reply. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi, I am Rahul, I am happily married for 3 years, we had an arranged marriage, though my wife is quite different than what makes me really fall in love and feel on the 9th cloud, but I had managed to cope up and live happily, but for the last few months I have been staying out in another city and visit her once or twice in a mont &amp; I have been living alone which was very difficult for me untill eventually recently I met a girl whom I found really attractive, though I told her everything abt my status in out first meeting we couldn’t stop talking to each other &amp; eventually I had to help her in a very serious situation of her successfully which made us spend a lot of time together during which both of us got really close to each other and now have been more regular in chats and desperate to meet, we have been physical till yet though we came across a chance but somehow we got away with it and we are meeting regularly now and knowing abt each other yet to express our feelings clearly to each other and controlling them.</p> 
            <p>Now I am really confused as in how to handle this situation because I dnt want to affect my marriage and at the same time dnt want to lose that girl as I really feel great with her but I have a fear of ruining my marriage and hurting that girl.. what should I do.. ??</p>

            <p>I loved a women who is now my wife, but even before I got married, I felt that something is wrong, and that she is not the women that I want, but I don’t know why I kept going and married her but I guess I didn’t want to brake her heart,<br> and now after marriage the situation got worst, even in the early days of the marriage, I felt that I married the wrong women, and I tried to find anything that may make me love her, but day after day, I felt that I’m stuck and I made a big mistake by marring her and my love to her kept deceasing,<br> Unfortunately, we had a baby, and now he is 1 year and half old.<br> And I felt that now there is no turning back, until the day came when I met a colleague, who I got attracted to , I loved everything about her, I felt that she is my type, but I tried not to make that affect my current situation, until the day came when I told her that I love her, and it turned out that she also loves me in secret since I’m married.</p> 
            <p>And now we are in love, but I don’t know what to do ! I know I shouldn’t leave my son (which is the only one I care about in my marriage) but I feel like that this my chance to correct thing, otherwise I will be in the same situation again after few years if I stayed married, and I will feel more stuck in future.</p> 
            <p>I know I made a mistake by not deciding to leave my wife before we get married, but now I guess is better time to fix things before it is too late.</p> 
            <p>I have been married for 2 years, 10 months so far.</p>

            <p>I’ve been married for 8 years, with my husband total 13 years, I’ve made a lot mistakes to hurt him but was never my intention to do so. However, I have a best friend who I’ve known for 8 years also – he was one of my former “affairs” but he and I remained friends after I worked things and went back with my husband and ironic it may seem my friend and husband are good friends today and he’s part of our family life as well as our children who love him.</p> 
            <p>The thing is, I’ve always loved my best friend for a long time – he is the only one that undersands me and accepts me for who I am while my husband struggles in accepting my ways and mind set. I feel more connected with my friend than my husband. My husband lately has been showing less interest in me, doesn’t talk as much, less interacts with the kids, I am constantly doing all the work everyday when he sleeps (he works overnights) and just thinks he can pat the kids head and everything Is okay.</p> 
            <p>Ive developed feelings that aren’t there anymore for my husband, he doesn’t do anything for me to make me feel good about myself or our marriage. The feelings are just plain. I feel like I’m just staying with him because of the kids and I didn’t want go down the road where Ive been down before and end up coming back. I want to be sure this is workable or not… but at the same time myf eelings for my friend are real not just some …… lust or desires. I love how he listens to me, I love how he treats me, how he is able to go shopping with me, how he is able to take all my anger when I’m mad, and so much more….. he actually listens to me. </p> 
            <p>What is going on with this? Can you help? Advices? Insights?</p>

            <p>Just like everyone else here on these posts, i am married. its been about 7 years. the truth is that i married my wife not because of love, but because of my daughter. my wife became pregnant before we even thought of marriage, and i just decided we should get married so my child would not grow up with her dad here and mom there. every day i think i want out, but i cannot go because of my daughter. i know that if my wife and i separate i will only get to see my daughter on the weekends, and i cannot do that. i love my daughter too much. i want to see her and hug her everyday.</p> 
            <p>i am not happy; i live with a woman i do not love. she is more like a good friend, not a wife. i met this other woman some time ago, and i cannot stop thinking of her. we only talk and and sometimes see each other; we do not have a physical or sexual relationship because she is also married, and we do not want to be cheaters. we just talk about our problems with our spouses, and talk about how in the future it would be wonderful if we end up together. i love everything i know about her, the way she talks, the things she says, the fact that she will not cheat on her husband, her culture and religion (she is a muslim, i am christian… weird, huh?) we talk for hours about everything, and she makes me feel so good, and i make her feel good too.</p> 
            <p>it is tearing me apart inside… i swear as i type this my eyes are getting watery! oh god… what to do???????</p>

I care deeply for my husband but i have developed strong feelings for someone else.It happens to be his relative, we don’t have children and my husband is a workaholic. I feel so all alone , i often tell him that we need to spend more time together. My heart and mind is so messed up. I am usually the one who can give lots of advice, but know one knows what I’m experiencing and that is hurting ……who do I turn to. I’m praying that God will give me the strength to overcome this temptations. Auy advice will be appreciated. </p>

            <p>Hi</p> 
            <p>I am a 34 years old married woman with a 6 1/2 years old son. I have been married for close to 10 years. My marriage was arranged by my parents, and if I come to think of it, I love my husband but I’m not head over heels in love with him. My marriage has seen a lot of ups and downs, but I remained firm to make it work.<br> Suddenly few months back I met a person, younger in age and from a different country and different religion. I started having such strong emotions for him that it feels like he is all pervasive, and I can’t see anything but him. I keep thinking about him all the time. We became really intimate a couple of times, and it felt wonderful. I feel valued, beautiful, perfect around him. We bonded over similar ideologies, and similar taste on many things which I could never even explain to my husband.<br> I know this relationship has no future, but I would like to hear what you have to say at marriagehelper.</p>

            <p>Hi. I been living with my spouse for two years now. At first I loved her with so much passion but now I don’t know where our spark went. I mean I still love her but I’m not really happy in my marriage. I’m staYing with her only because of my son but other than that I’m not happy as I used to be. My heart right now is with my female bestfriend who I met 5 years ago, but she lives on the other side of the country from me. She has the same feelings for me as I do for her. She also has a man and is engaged but I figured if I meet her maybe I can change that and maybe we can be the couple we always talked about. I really don’t know what to do.</p>

              <p>In my case, i keep on talking to this beautiful woman i found. every day she calls me i get all excited, like a little boy. i decided to just let fate and destiny decide. i cannot just leave my wife for another woman; that would not be right. i actually thought about making my wife hate me on purpose so that she would be the one to call the marriage off and i would be free to be with my new love… i dont know, crazy thoughts…</p>

            <p>Hi! I’m in very similar situation like many here in love with another man, while being married…</p> 
            <p>I’m not tempted to leave or tell my husband about my situation, he’s a good man and I can live my life this way, no problem at all…</p> 
            <p>I have other problem, I think this problem wasn’t featured here – first, emotional affair consequences… </p> 
            <p>And second, do I have the right to push my husband live with me – in case – he will be in my shoes some time in his life..?? Respectively, what if he falls in love with someone else and figure out that he doesn’t want continue loveless relationship with me..?</p> 
            <p>For the time being I’m being the ‘honourable’ wife (although I do not see pretence as something honourable), I will sacrifice my ‘possible love of the life’ and then, bang, time will come, he will fall in love – and will tell me goodbye….<br> At least he will be honest and for the right reason, and who could blame him..??</p> 
            <p>Thirdly, those people who love someone outside the marriage are actually robbing partner of the essence of marriage, that is love! While, also not giving their partner a chance to actually re-marry someone who will love them back! </p> 
            <p>And I have difficulty to comprehend what good it does to children – apart to teach them the same doomed/pretentious ways – stay in loveless relationship and count it normal or even compulsory!</p>

            <p>I have been in this situation a few years back. I was and am happily married. There was a co-worker who I fell in love with. We were very different people externally, but our souls somehow knew each other. I sometimes think I am a weird person, having different values for myself to what I have for other people. When it comes to others, I forgive easily and am ok with almost anything they do in their own lives. But when it comes to my live, I have these set of values I grew up with that I impose on myself (come from my parents, but others I have made up myself based on what I think is right or wrong).</p> 
            <p>Anyways, I was falling more and more in love, while not getting physically close in any way. We never said a word to each other about having feelings. But we both knew we had somehow got involved emotionally to the point where none of us could get out. I later read that its called an emotional affair.</p> 
            <p>After 2 years, when we still getting closer and closer, I decided that I need to tell my husband, who surprised me even more than he usually does by actually understanding! He googled polyamorous relationships and said I might want to consider that! Unfortunately, it was difficult for me to imagine that.</p> 
            <p>It wasn’t that I wasn’t in love with my husband. It was just that there was a new intensity that I hadn’t felt before in a long time. Things had become a bit ‘business as usual’ with my husband, and the new person provided excitement and a deep connection. </p> 
            <p>One thing I was absolutely clear about, no matter what else happened, was that there was no way on heaven or earth (or anywhere else) that I could hurt my husband. I would kill myself before I did that. I could not lie to him, but I could not hurt him either. </p> 
            <p>As for the other man, even though it would hurt both of us initially, we would learn to live with separation. If I wasn’t faithful to my husband, then a few years later the same story would repeat itself when the excitement died down in this new relationship. I could not get myself to think that the meaning of something so deep could be so superficial that I would just let it end in a few years.</p> 
            <p>I found another job finally and moved on. It was excruciating pain to let him go. I think the pain was more from the fact that I wanted to confess my love at least once, and I did not say a word, nor did he. Looking back, I know that the entire office knew, but we refused to say a word to each other. It was over.</p> 
            <p>I haven’t been in touch with him all these years, but I know that I have made the right decision. My husband is a soul the universe gave to me to care for, to love, to cherish, to ensure nothing hurts that soul. Although I don’t believe in religion, I believe that I will not hurt my husband knowingly, no matter what. That is what I will stay true to always.</p>

            <p>Hi! I was married 4 yrs back. It was an arranged marriage. I am very sensitive and emotional person because i lost my parents when i was 10 yrs and faced many things on my own since then. Had few affairs but none worked out. My husband is a very nice person and very hard working. We both are quite opposite to each other. We started facing problems right after few weeks of our marriage.He never accepted me as a person i am because of which i lost my confidence in myself. We tried working things out but nothing really worked. His priorities were his family, friends, work .He hardly had anytime for me. I was not steady with my job which is again one of the reasons for his frustration. I was emotionally deeply hurt many times with his words. He is supportive otherwise but there are certain conditions to it. we hardly had anything to talk about than budget and routine.Due to financial condition he is strict with money as well.</p> 
            <p>Never had big dreams just wanted a life partner who respects and understands me. After marriage i changed as a person, used to think before i say anything or do anything. I believe to live in present and he thinks more about future. I felt his love is often conditional.I stopped to do many things which i used to love once upon a time. Never felt as its my home or i can freely ask him anything i wanted. I started thinking of taking divorce after few months and it was there in my mind for a long time. Few months back when i started working i fell in love with a man who is divorced and has one kid. We thought of breaking but than couldn’t. I started living in a separate room given much thought about it and finally decided to file a petition thinking separation might bring us near to each other. </p> 
            <p>Mean while he told parents and things got worse. In the process i felt he thinks more about himself than my safety. Anyway i moved out of the house to see if distance might work.I am very happy being single again, i have my freedom and in love with this person with whom i work. We totally enjoy each others company, we too fight but we resolve everything immediately. Now my husband realizes his mistake, often comes to meet me, brings me flower. He said he was very happy with me because he he feels comfortable with me and was very happy in our marriage..but i felt exactly opposite in front of him. </p> 
            <p>He wanted me to come back and wanted to work out things between us.He now understands me and wanted to keep me happy. He seems very sad and i feel extremely bad for him ..i feel guilty and very selfish. People say after hearing my reasons that they are not so major and such things happens in a marriage. i m not saying it was all bad but i was not happy.</p>

            <p>Hi. I have been married for 5 years…we have had our ups and downs and we have a house, but no kids together although we have kids with ex partners. Over the past 30 years I have seen my childhood sweetheart, my first love, off and on….most recently, a month ago. I know that I truly love this man, but I don’t want to hurt my husband either, yes, I know, boo hoo for me…..but my sweetheart doesn’t want a relationship with me, whilst I’m married, and it’s not guaranteed if I divorce either…..I think I want to stay with my husband, but I have no passion for him…I even want to cry if he tries to hold my hand as I wish it was someone else…..I don’t know how to go back to loving my husband again.</p>

            <p>Hi everyone. I have been married for four years. I knew from the very beginning that I was not in love with my husband. I’ve met this wonderful man about a year ago. We’re so close and we have so much in common. I never felt this way before and he’s not someone that I would be physically attracted to. I fell in love with someone for the first time ever that I saw what’s inside. We started our affair three months ago. I do not want to let him go. I want my husband to leave but he doesn’t get the hint.</p>

              <p>What you are experiencing is classic limerence. You are rewriting history, saying that you have never felt a love like this before. You have only been involved in this affair for three months. You won’t believe it, but limerence doesn’t last. You read the article above, and you know what it says happens. I know you want to believe that you are the exception. Everyone wants to believe that they are the exception. Unfortunately, no one is. I, for one, am glad your husband isn’t leaving. He loves you. He is trying to stand and fight for your marriage. One day, you’ll be glad he did.</p>

            <p>I have been married for 11 years, my husband has cheated on me several times in the past 11 years, some where shorter affairs then others, and one was a very emotional affair that led to a long physical affair. He has promised this affair is over and wants to work on our marriage. We also have 3 children.<br> Earlier this year I was contacted by a very good friend from high school. We have always been really good friends that occasionally slept together. We feel apart when I started dating my husband and now he reached back out to me. He lives 1000 miles away from me but we were able to see eachother 4 times this year. I am falling back in love with him and I am not sure how he feels about me. He has said he has always dreamed of being with me for the past 20 years and that I should have married him. He has told me that he cares about me just as he always has, but that we live two completely different lives and live 1000 miles away from eachother and he doubts our current relationship will ever change. I think about him all of the time and have a hard time being intimate or even kissing my husband. I too have secretly had thoughts and dreams of him over these past years and don’t want to lose him again. Any advice?</p>

            <p>I’m not sure if this will help me or not, and this is why:</p> 
            <p>“Your desire is to have, not to hurt. (There may be an exception to that if you feel that your spouse has been unkind or hurtful. If so, that degree of negativity toward your spouse probably increased its intensity after your affair began.)”</p> 
            <p>More likely than not, I have been considering cheating as a way of retaliating after being in a verbally and emotionally abusive relationship for so long.</p> 
            <p> “Your emotions are intense now, but they won’t be forever. Within a couple years, if not before, you’ll discover that the Cinderella or Price Charming you’re in love with isn’t quite as wonderful as you think. In the ecstasy of new love people overlook flaws, quirks, and problems in the other. When that emotions evolves, as it must and will, you’ll start to be bothered by things that never bothered you before. You will discover that Cinderella and Prince Charming exist only in fairy tales. All the rest of us are flawed and at times hard to live with.”</p> 
            <p>But this isn’t true for me at all… I have already decided that the other person’s “flaws”, or differences, aren’t worth perusing a romantic relationship… all I wanted was a physical relationship and more likely than not, I was looking to hurt the person that was hurting me…</p> 
            <p>“Repeatedly those who left their spouses for a remarkable love come to me after a few years and say they wish they could do it all over again. This time they wouldn’t abandon their marriage but would figure a way to work out their problems. They would not expect their children NOT to be negatively affected by the divorce. They would look deeper into their hearts to see that their beliefs and values are part of their very identity and realize that to live in contradiction to them would lead them to become someone quite different than they were. They would admit that there is never a “happily ever after” and that leaving one relationship for another is trading one set of problems for another.<br> In short, they would have stayed in the first marriage and done all they could to make it work.”<br> This also doesn’t offer me an answer to my problem… I wouldn’t go back to my first marriage… This is not my first time cheating, my current partner is the man I had an affair with in my first marriage. I am not deluding myself into believing I am in “love” with another man either… I have considered cheating only out of a strong sexual attraction and how this flirtation I have has made me feel about myself… My current partner put me down and called me terrible names for our entire relationship and I stayed and accepted it because my guilt made me believe I deserved it. Now that I have admitted to thinking about cheating to him, he has really made an effort to treat me well… I just don’t know if it will last.</p> 
            <p>“What do you honestly, at the deepest level of your being, expect it to be ten years from now if you abandon your marriage, maybe destroy another in the process (if your lover is married as well), and violate your core beliefs?”</p> 
            <p>Independence</p>

              <p>You weren’t having a relationship affair. It sounds like you were having what would be classified as a “one-night stand”. Even if it lasted longer than one night, it was primarily about sex. That’s different than a relationship affair. You can type in one night stand in the search bar on our site to get more articles about that specifically.</p>

            <p>I know everyone says that their situation is different, but in this case I do think mine is unique. </p> 
            <p>I have been married for 11 years to very honorable man. We have three grade school age children. On the surface we have the perfect life. Beautiful home, happy family, picture perfect. About 5 years into our marriage I began to feel misunderstood by my husband. I am a very passionate person, and he is very reasonable and fact based. I began to feel trapped in my marriage and my life. Behind the happy, smiling face on our Christmas card photo was a very lonely, isolated person.<br> We had been attending a church regularly, but both agreed that the teaching was not in depth enough and decided to look elsewhere. These days you can listen to sermons online without even attending a church to visit. So I began listening to sermons from local churches online in my spare time trying to get a feel for where we should visit.<br> One day as I was folding laundry I was about to tune in to yet another online sermon. The pastors words were so gripping and I could relate so completely that I abandoned my laundry entirely and found myself sitting next to the laptop nodding and taking notes. There were a total of maybe 8 or 9 sermons posted and I had listened to them all in a matter of days. I was convinced that this was the church we were meant to attend. I found out a few weeks later that this church also led an after school Bible activity club at my kids’ school. I decided to volunteer at the club as a way of getting to know more about the church and its members and outreach. The pastor, who I’ll call Joe, was the leader of this after school club. There was not an initial physical attraction, he is 14 years older than me and also shorter. And bald. 🙂 But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I could completely connect to his lessons both in the sermons and even in the little after school club lessons. I just admired him so much and could really relate to everything he said. I also volunteered as a non-member to help with the church’s Vacation Bible School. I got to know the members of the church pretty well and even became friends. We kept attending our regular church, but I helped out a lot with Joe’s churches activities. My kids grew to love him since they spent so much time with him and I found myself admiring him more and more. It continued this way for 4 years. Everything was always strictly professional and above board. Zero flirting, zero inappropriate behavior. Finally we made a break from our old church and began attending Joe’s church on Sundays. The more I was around him, the more my feelings grew. Before I knew it I realized they extended beyond admiration. I loved him so deeply. And, yes, he is also married to a very sweet lady. I tried to do the right thing. I told my husband I wanted to go back to our old church but did not tell him why. Joe was so very saddened to hear that we would not be placing membership. No explanation I offered seemed to jusify it, and I could see how hurt he was. I made another horrible choice and in a moment of weakness one day I told him that we had to leave because I had developed feelings for him. I was shaking like a leaf and I said nothing more and left. The next day, he called and admitted that he had been burying similar feelings for years. From there over the next several months, we exchanged emails and spoke in person about how to handle what we were feeling. After about 3 months, my husband found a text that was enough to expose everything. He confronted Joe and Joe told his wife and resigned as a pastor. We didnt speak or email or have any contact for 6 weeks. It was agony, but I didn’t want to hurt my husband further by leaving him. At the end of 6 weeks, I ran into Joe in town. He was working 3rd shift at an auto factory. He said he missed me and loved me and would do it all over again because he could never deny his love for me. We started communicating again, only this time in secret. I do love him and he does love me. So much. Our spouses do not deserve to be hurt, and our children do not deserve a broken home. But I truly love him. Flaws, good, bad, right, wrong. I can never stop. Please help.</p>

              <p>Ellen,</p> 
              <p>I know you feel that your situation is unique. However, nearly every month we have someone in our workshop who landed in an affair because his position as a pastor left him vulnerable to such an interaction.</p> 
              <p>This is no different.</p> 
              <p>In fact, since both of you are Christians, it very well may be that both of you are saying, “God led us to each other!”<br> Your feelings are overshadowing what you know is right and wrong. God would never lead two people into a situation and set them up for sin. It’s far from God…this is more the workings of Satan. He loves taking people in positions of authority in churches and exposing their weaknesses in hopes of taking people away from Christianity. Please, I beg you, don’t fall into this. We’ve seen it too many times.</p> 
              <p>You’ve been married 11 years. Your husband doesn’t deserve this. Your children don’t deserve this. And if you left your husband to be with the other man, you would eventually resent the fact that he didn’t live up to his Christian values…and it wouldn’t be unheard of for the same thing to happen again…but with you being the wife he leaves.</p>

            <p>My husband and I have been together since 1983, married since ’87. He is 6 years younger than I and began his high-paying career early in our relationship. I’ve been a professional since the mid ’70s. Things went great in our marriage until stress with our young children and his job created a lot of anxiety in him. He lost his job in his early 40s and has remained unemployed. He became an alcoholic, with his secret coming out when he became deathly ill this year. For at least 7 years our family has dealt with his attempts at recovery, at great financial and emotional cost. He now is so ill that he’s nearly died several times. Friends of mine, and even some family, have expressed surprise that I’m still in my marriage. He’s finally begun to get psychiatric help, after months of couple’s counseling. Our young adult sons, who live with us, admit that they stay due to worry about our situation. They are dealing with scars of their dad’s addiction. Earlier this year, after the shock of being told that I would likely become a widow, something in me snapped, and I began to crave a life that afforded me the fun and romance I’d been denied for years. That’s when an old friend I’d been casual with on Facebook began to sound different to me, revealing his intense admiration for me from three decades ago. After a few months of trying to keep this friendship from blossoming into a romance, I gave in and let our daily online and phone conversations turn totally crazy in love. We talk for hours on end, just as we did in our 20s. In the meantime, I was diagnosed with cancer, which I attributed in part to the stress of my marriage. This friendship is truly important to him, as he admitted his concern about the wedding ring I wear. I no longer feel guilt over my feelings since they seem justified. I am burned out, angry, resentful, and exhausted from so many aspects of my marriage, but am holding off on discussing a separation or anything heavy with my husband due to his fragile medical condition (my sons are pretty aware of my feelings). My friend, who like me is in his early 60s and still quite youthful, finally met up with me in person recently, after 35 years, and it was a magical day filled with conversation and relaxation. One of my biggest hurdles is our beloved home. Economically, it would be impossible to live apart, and no one would be willing to give it up. I’d really like to date my friend periodically and see where it goes, and be honest with my husband once he’s healthy enough to handle my decision.</p>

            <p>Hello All, I don’t know where to start … So here it goes. I have been married for 1 year and 2 mos. I met my current husband and we dated for 1 year … Spent everyday together and got engaged, moved in together and then married 6 mos later. After 5 mos my husband lost his job. The company he worked for was horrible but he also didn’t help the situation by not being on time with deadlines. So I was the sole provider for our house paying the full rent amount and all the bills while he seemed to not be in a rush to get a job. After a while I noticed that he does not realize we are sinking in a hole and he continues to spend money from his EDD like he had a steady job, instead of paying for his car payment which was thefew bills he was responsible for since I was paying for all. So i would try to figure out how to catch up on his car payments by working overtime. Overall, I was finally realizing that I married a person who is completely reckless with money and has no motivation in life to do better for provide for his family. I have always been responsible with my spending and credit and always had a 2 jobs. All these character flaws were not visible when we’re dating. Which led me to believe and have resentment towards him for holding on to me because he knew I was more stable then he was and him being so selfish with his choices. My current husband is White, Catholic and comes from a stable loving home environment. I am indian , Sikh. I started to realize that I miss my family and maybe I should file for a divorce and have an arrange marriage.<br> At the same time I got an email from my ex boyfriend who was is indian and we were suppose to marry but we were young at that time but out families agreed and we’re happy. He was still single and was considering a arrange marriage but reaches out to tell me that he loves me and wants to try again before taking that step. I thought ,, gosh this must be a sign. Our relationship was not perfect but we were older now and I would have my parents blessing and I my life again and I would have my culture back and have a stable person who does belief in providing for his family.<br> I feel stuck between two worlds, my current husband is a good person but I don’t think he will ever change his selfish. ways my ex- boyfriend he can be hard to deal with but he will always figure things out and is not selfish.</p>

            <p>I have been married for 15 years, on our first anniversary husband said he will be back so we could go to dinner, never came back until I called him. He has kids that are grown now but he always gave their mother more respect then me. He never really talk to her in my presents. He has cheated on me many times. I asked him out of curiosity if he would get my name tatto on him He said no one day we might not be married, I’ve seen were he would call and text women. Went months without love making, he would get mad at me and would not speak for weeks and weeks, he would even take his ring off when we had arguments. Know I am attracted to someone, and they are attracted to me, if this develop into something so be it. I feel maybe he is getting back what he has done to me. Because now he wants to be a good husband, for the last 1.5 years of 15. But I still have problems with how he treated me, not out to hurt him,but had he treated me right and been faithful, then maybe this would have never been a possibility for me to leave or have affair. if I do it will not be sexually.</p>

            <p>When I was 14, I was completely obsessed with a gentleman in his mid 20’s. I dreamed of him and always said he would be my prince charming. He had no idea as me being a young kid he had a wife and child. Now, 10 years later he has moved out of province but recently we have connected and started chatting again. I think I have fallen in love with him and he says he has the same feelings towards myself.</p> 
            <p>I am currently in a relationship, engaged to a wonderful man that I do infact love. What do I do? I am so lost with emotion, lost on which direction to take. I don’t want to lose my bestfriend, the man I love but, I don’t want to feel guilty because my “dream guy” is now waiting for me….</p> 
            <p>Ah love, so confusing.</p>

            <p>Here’s my story as briefly as I can make it…5 years ago I met and tell in love with a man that I thought cared for me. Almost 2 years later he just dropped me like a bad habit and moved another girl in to his house. I was devastated – had never felt so much pain or at such a deep level. That pain changed me. About 6 months prior I had met a man that I had developed a platonic friendship with and when my ex walked away my friend told me he was in love with me.<br> It took me about 6 months of him pursuing me patiently and lovingly for me to feel love for him though I never have felt as strongly as I had for my ex. I knew this man loved me and wouldn’t leave me and 13 months later we got married.<br> Now then, from the beginning my husband and I have had an obstacle to contend with. He had an inguinal hernia that caused him excruciating pain for weeks and weeks but wouldn’t seek help for. Weeks became months and then years…3 years of me having to go without affection, being rejected, ignored, and feeling unloved, unwanted etc…<br> He did go through 2 operations but both failed to correct the problem and he’d drag his feet again as long as possible before seeking help again. Finally a few months ago he had a third and final operation that did solve the problem but the damage to our marriage is done. Intimacy is gone and any attempt at anything physical feels awkward and I have not been able to get past the resentment and hurt.<br> A couple months ago my ex came back into the picture and what started out as an innocent acquaintance became ten times better than it had been 3.5 years ago. He says he knows he made a stupid choice and wants me back. I feel like I have the chance I always wanted to have this man in my life and there’s no awkwardness or discomfort. He feels like home to me.<br> I confessed my actions to my husband and he’s crushed. I never wanted to hurt him. I was just tired of always hurting. He says he’s fixed now and sees how deeply I was scarred by his inconsiderate behavior and desperately wants a chance to redeem himself…<br> I know you guys always say that staying in the marriage is the best choice but is it here? I can’t wrap my head around walking away from my ex. Especially not now when he doesn’t want to walk away from me…please help me.</p>

            <p>I have been married for almost 34 years. For the last 12 of those years I have been in love with someone else. My husband has cheated on me 5 times that I know about and had a child with one of the other women. I took him back time after time and forgave him because I loved him so very much and we had 3 children together. When my last child turned 18 I just gave up. My husband was an alcoholic and physically abusive for the 1st 5 years of our marriage. When he stopped drinking, he never physically abused me again. However, the verbal abuse is worse than the physical abuse. I got to the point where I thought I was worth nothing. I hadn’t been permitted to work when I was raising the kids and after they were grown I got a job. Suddenly men were paying attention to me and I’m not going to lie, I enjoyed it. As for the man I am seeing, it is someone I have known longer than I have known my husband. After 12 years we are just now to the point of talking about the future and whether we should spend it together. He wants that but I’m married and afraid of taking the leap. If I am honest with myself, there’s not really a lot left to salvage of the marriage, but part of it is my upbringing will not let me walk away. I don’t know what to do! Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Ive been married for over 3 years now. I was young when I got married and because of my religious beliefs was told it was better to get married then to sin against god and commit fornication before marriage. So me and my boyfriend of a few years (started dating when i was 17) got married by justice of peace. During our first year of marriage and into our second year my husband was never home. He stayed out late drinking sometimes wouldn’t come home until close to 4am and i wouldn’t know where he was. No answers to texts, calls anything. I remember looking up police reports to see if he got in an accident. i would sometimes get in my car at 2am and drive down the highways to see if i could find him. If he needed my help. He came from a non affectionate family and i came from a very loving family. So this posed as a problem as well. Since he rarely showed affection for me. As well as we never had sex. When your 21 and married and never had sex before marriage. You are going to want that. which he rarely provided. And rarely ever kissed me. After years of being pushed away i became very numb to him. Coming home drunk became a normal thing. His sarcastic mean remarks to me became a usual thing and you can forget about real love and Intimacy. He made me just feel cheap and worthless to him. He feels like a roommate to me. Almost like a sibling or family member. Through my job I became friends with a gentleman who was going through similar things with his marriage. We spend a good amount of time together because we were always on the same shifts. He is a few years older but we really had a lot in common. Same goals, same likes, dislikes, same moral goals. We just understand each other. Our friendship has grown especially knowing him for a year and a half now. We never meant for this to happen but we are completely head over heals in love. We talk every day all day from morning until night and sometimes during the night leaving messages for each other to find if the other wakes up in the middle of the night or to read when the other wakes up. We really do feel like soul mates seeing as though he reminds me of home an the men in my family i feel comfortable with him in a way where i can depend on him and trust him that i have never been able to with my husband. Me an this gentleman kissed and started making out after which i told my husband of my actions and to please forgive me. I told my lover that we no longer can be intimate in a kissing way an that we need to just keep things professional. A month or two went by and me and my lover started kissing again and we felt like our relationship was building even stronger now. I told my husband of my actions a second time and my husband was devastated. He asked me if i wanted to work on things with him which i told him i did and we then started receiving marriage counseling through our church each week. During this time i still had feelings for this other man and realized that i was in fact in love with him. My husband owned up to how he treated me in the past and took responsibility for my actions because he understood how his neglect made me feel like i needed that love some where else. It has been 6 months since my husband and i went through the struggle the second time of me telling him. He has been really trying hard to change and to be more affectionate towards me. he even has tried not drinking as much. All of which i truly do appreciate because i really do love him. But my love for him is different now like i said before it is like a sibling. I don’t want to hurt him. But i really love this other man. we talk everyday like i said before and the kissing has started again and has become a source of comfort for the both of us. we want to be together even if it means waiting till our old age. I don’t no what to do. The thought of leaving my husband terrifies me because i am not financially stable to be on my own and if i divorce the only way religiously i could get re-married is if there are gowns for divorce like adultery or fornication committed. So if i wanted to be with him then i would have to go down that path which is something i don’t want to do. An if i did there is a very large change that i would get shunned from my religion and family and friends. Which is a very scary thought. I do not no what to do. Im torn between being stuck in a marriage that i’snt intimate in a loving way. A husband who is basically a child in the mind. Has drinking problems. But is trying. And being with some one who i truly believe i was meant for. Neither me nor my lover has been with any one else but our spouses. Neither of us have ever had sex with anyone but our spouses either. We have not had sex or anything yet. But we get closer every day in love supporting each other emotionally. Which kills me because my husband has forgiven me and trusts me and is showing love towards me now which makes me feel sick. I just want this relationship with my lover and to have a good relationship with god but i feel as if i am in a corner. Please help.</p>

              <p>Elizabeth, you are trying to justify your relationship with your lover by saying things like, “neither of us have ever been with anyone but our spouses.” I can tell that deep down, you are torn. As much as you try to justify it, there’s part of you that feels guilty and knows that it is wrong. </p> 
              <p>Can I suggest that you read this article on <a href="http://www.marriagehelper.com/married_but_in_love_with_someone_else.php" rel="nofollow">“I’m Married but in Love with Someone Else”</a></p>

            <p>Interesting comments here. I have been married 17 years and with my wife for 20 years. We have a ten year old and I am Catholic. About a year ago I kissed another woman at a work event and felt guilty. First time I ever stepped out. A year later, same conference, same girl only this time it went further and we slept together. We carried on an affair of sorts for 2 1/2 months (I say “of sorts” because she lives 2+ hours away so it was mostly emotional though we were together a total of 6 times sexually.) She has recently pulled the plug on the relationship and it is killing me. She had given me an ultimatum to leave my wife but I couldn’t because in the end, my wife is a wonderful human being who does not deserve any of this and I could not hurt her or my daughter. The problem is that now, I can barely pick my head up off the pillow. I’m drinking a lot. I’m depressed. And I have no desire to be sexually with my wife. I just think of the other woman (who was 14 years younger than me.) I just connected with her on a different level than my wife. My wife is very conservative and wholesome whereas the other girl and I are both much more into drinking and concerts and fun (despite the fact I am 45 and she is 31). She too is married with a 5 year old. I feel like I made the right decision, but I’m miserable about it and I miss the other girl tremendously. We talked constantly and poured our souls out to each other. I feel lost and depressed and have prayed I just die in my sleep so that my wife doesn’t have to live with a cheat and I don’t burden anyone anymore. I miss the other woman. I love my wife more like a sister. It is impossible to motivate myself to do anything. Lost.</p>

            <p>My husband enjoys being miserable and making me miserable. I have had this problem for 14 years now. Since the day I met him, he has been a true downer. A control freak and an alcoholic in denial and an emotional and psychological abuser! I am fed up with him and his negative attitude. Just today I came home happy trying to make dinner when I asked him to please light a fire so that we can gather around the fire place and paint some canvases with the children while dinner was cooking…. And he threw a fit! A big, bad, ugly hissy fit! All my life I feel like I’m wrestling with an Alligator. Day in and day out! He is the most manipulative, crankie, sabotaging person I know….. How can one save a marriage like that???? Please help! I am at my wits end!!!!! I’m tired of always giving in. And doing whatever he wants. It is always his way or no way at all! He probably would have lit the fire anyways, but he had to say no, just to spite me! He too says that he is done with me. But he will not leave me alone. Or let me go. Our marriage has turned into “The War of of Roses” since 2008 I have been living in war with my spouse. I’ve been so miserable in this marriage that I have even contemplated taking my life. Because there is nowhere to run!!!! My family is against divorce!!! And believe that I have to just become more submissive in order to make him happy. Which I have done and he himself says that he hates! He won’t go to marriage counseling. He won’t go to AA. He won’t divorce me or “allow me” to divorce him. I am so sick of it! Unbelievably bitterly sick of it!!!! I feel that children are better of with a healthy divorce than an unhealthy household! What can I do???? Please help!!!! Prayers needed! Thanks</p>

              <p>And this has led me, to have many affairs, in the desperate look for affection, and some sort of positive attention!!! Needless to say that I have never found either! I am so hopeless and heart broken that I have no idea what else to do!</p>

            <p>help me : I am married for five yrs I. Relationship since 6 yrs . I never felt attracted to any man till date despite the fact my husband does not touch me… He is trying to come out and we think his tastes are singular and he may be gay but society and other Indian family pressures force our big decision. We both love each other… Like best friends and brother sister we are great companion…. But no sex … No touch … No romance… No passion at all…. I can feel his pain and since I promised for better or for worst … I will hold on to him…. We decided to have babies… But he dose t even get erection… Got medical help and somehow got pregnant without sex… Lost the baby after 3 months…. Am absolutely broken inside… My father my only parent also passed away… I can’t discuss my pain… I stopped talking to my older male friends as my hubby is insecure and possessives. But now I recently joined a new project couple of months back… And my acting manager ….. A super wonderful man …. Super hot (to me) he is 43 married with two boys and I am 11 years younger…. We had sparks right from day one when I joined… Our eyes are connected his blue and my brown eyes just follow each other….. He always talks about his wife … So besotted with her… His wife’s second marriage and his first…. But now I feel he likes me… I could be 100% wrong being in such vulnerable situation but …. I feel the passion …. When I see him now I almost kiss his lips with my eyes and so does he…. He now parks his car on my level sometimes walks me out… But he is a wonderful man and am bruised…. I just cherish these moments …. Though I imagine him every day and get wet…. I had a very very passionate relationship before marriage for four-five yrs till it became bad and I just had to get out of it…. Became fifty shades of grey….<br> Now this man is changing his group within the company and offered me job as full time … I can’t as am on visa…. He will be gone in few months … Same building but we won’t be working together…. Like now my day starts with meetings with him and pretty much ends with him too….<br> What should I do…. Am now not able to live in the life I chose and accepted to live in denial and abstinence……<br> I think I am falling for him…..<br> I always wish him well… Can never wish him to leave his happy life and leave it for a miserable person like me who just fights to be strong … N now broken.</p> 
            <p>Help me …..</p>

            <p>Never thought I would ever land up on the marriage helper website but unfortunately that is a situation and I am here to seek help.<br> I am 36yr old married man with a lovely wife who is 32yr old. We live in India and both come from fairly open minded Indian family. We have been happily married for last 10 year and have an adorable daughter who is 8 yr old.<br> We have absolutely no issue visibly on relationship front but few days back something shocked me completely. Casually holding my wives cell phone I scanned her WhatsApp conversation with one of her best male friend and I saw some chat which indicate that something is going on between them beyond pure friendship. Convesation like Love you, miss you 🙁 (which are definely not casually used words in India), few comments indicating she is telling husband at home/ not at home etc.. They know each other since teenage days i.e. over 20 years. Even he is married to a beautiful wife for 10 yrs and have a child. In fact he got married to a girl which he loved for many years before we did so I don’t feel it is a case of ‘my old flame’ between him and my wife.<br> I know that he and my wife are very close friends for many years and I learnt to ignore some of their gestures over the time. But some of the conversation I saw has disturbed me completely. Moreover my wife has wiped out the history of chat which is making me even more nervous and suspicious :(.<br> I see there is no change in her behavior to me or my family as such and she is equally loving and caring as what she was years back. Sometimes I feel i might be the culprit as I am not giving her the attention she might be looking for which she is getting from her best friend for sure as they both share great interest in cooking and baking. I am really confused as I dont even know for how many years it might be going on and whether I should confront her or leave it as it is and try to be more loving, caring person who is attentive to her interests. I feel I might have let down her and that is why she might have found a person with whom she shares her interests and eventually got closer than a friendship. I just can’t get this thing out of my head until I talk to her but I am worried that she might get hurt and it would impact adversely to everything, my daughter and family relationships which is going on visibly quite well. Please help with the way forward.. I am really confused and worried chap. I feel if don’t speak up to her it would impact me, my career and possibly our relationship in future.</p>

            <p>I have been dating a guy in whom I found out he was married. By this time I already fell in love with him. I was married and my ex cheated and remarried the woman. I felt so much guilt because I felt I recked someone home. I caused the same amount of pain on someone that I went through even though I did not know he told me they where married seperated n he was gonna file a divorce. For 4 months I continued our relationship until one day I was trying to teach him how to work an app and pressed some button that went to his last text. He was still confessing to her he love her n was living with her. I told him I wanted nothing else to do with him n he keeps calling and texting me saying he would do whatever to prove to me he live me n want to be with me but I just lost all respect and cannot see myself with him any longer. But it hurts like and I feel like a fool because I do still love him very much.</p>

            <p>Hi, I am married about 1 and half year and still have feelings the one I had a relation before my marriage. He is living another country and now we are far from each other. Before my marriage and after my marriage we kept texting each other. He was telling me how much he misses me and I was the same because he didn’t know that I got married. I told him the situation few months ago and he said that it doesn’t matter if I am married or not. He still have feelings and misses me. He had married two times before I met. He has kids. And my marriage, my husband he is a good man but sometimes he is very aggressive and stubborn. We mostly argue. Sometimes he makes me think that we are coming from different worlds. But sometimes he is very caring and loving. I know he loves me a lot but the way he sees the life is totally different than the way I do although We are from the same culture and city. And the thing is I still miss my old lover. When he texts me he seems that he really wants and misses me but sometimes it takes months to text or speak to each other. I am so confused. This situation makes me aggressive and changes my behaviors against my husband. He is so innocent and doesn’t know anything. I just donno what to do. Should I keep texting him or just cut everything and never talk to him. Thanks 🙂</p>

            <p>I been married to the same person for 31 years, however I have strayed for one nights stands over the years and on the way a few affairs. Recently I met this person for a one night stand and it turned into an affair, Over time we learned that we grew up in the same area, we went to the same schools and both of us were in special needs classes. We had the same friends, this person managed a store near by where I lived and I remember going their for gas and groceries and seeing them their. I have a relative that lives in a retirement home and when I visited I remember passing this person in the hall way. I found out that their dad lives their too. I use to say hello in passing. Then we met online 3 years ago. Our paths have crossed so close over the years. We even had the same first grade teacher. When we looked at the year book together one day there we both were in the pictures just one row away. I have developed a deep emotional connection to this person that I have never experienced before in my life. We both shared the same experiences growing up and we fully understand each other. I grieve when we are away from each other if though a piece of me is missing. I want us to be together so badly. I no longer have a desire to meet anyone else.</p>

            <p>I had a very passionate relationship with my high school boyfriend, lots of very intense highs and lows. We broke up many times in our 4 year relationship, but always ended up back in each others arms before very long. My parents always hated him, even though they knew almost nothing about him, and after years of tryng, they finally convinced me that he wasn’t right for me. As much as I loved him, and wanted nothing more than to be with him, I made a logical decision to date and eventually marry someone that fell in the category of someone my parents would like, and I could “make it work” with. I was in a great deal of denial about this new relationship and what it offered me. I wanted someone to love me, and want to be with me. I quickly found out my husband was more interested in throwing himself into his work, and wanted me to do the same within the expectations he had for me. I worked tirelessly out of “wifely” duty to be good enough, until I couldn’t anymore, and we eventually seperated. A month later I experienced my first psychotic break, and my family sent me home against my will to live with him because none of them wanted to deal with my issues. We attended marriage workshops, weekend retreats, sunday school class on marriage, marital counseling, personal counseling, group therapy, you name it, we’ve tried it! In fact our very talented marriage therapist suggested we stopped coming all together because she felt it was doing more damage than good. Then a few years ago, during a particularly lonely time, my boyfriend from high school contacted me on Facebook. We started to talk on the phone In the evenings, and once when I was back in our home state we met up for a few hours. Nothing physical happened between us, but just being around him again make me realize what I had been missing. That love, acceptance, desire to be around me as much as possible. He brings out a creative, playful side of me, he gets and understands me, and for an INFJ, that is rare! We have stopped all communication over a year ago, and my husband knows, but how do I get over the ache of not having this other person in my life. Is hasn’t gone away, not for one single day in 18 years and I therefore dont imagine it too anytime soon. How do I live my life, when all I want to do is live mine with someone else. ?</p>

            <p>Hello, I honestly never saw myself in this situation ever! I have been married to my husband for almost 12 yrs. We have two young boys, a nice house, 2 good jobs, etc. He honestly is a really good guy! Over the last couple years and I realize everyone gets into a rut, but it’s like we are more companions than anything. I love him with all my heart, he’s never done anything to me that would make me feel any different, let alone I’ve never had any other thoughts of another man in my life. We both met right out of high school, married in our 20’s and now have our adult lives. Several months ago, I found an old boyfriend of mine on FB. I friend requested him and we started talking. He was actually in a really dark place and I was helping him work through some issues. He also unfortunately has a criminal past, drug/alcohol issues. But he truly is harmless! We both met years ago as teenagers and he was my first love. Unfortunately grew apart just because of the paths we each were headed down and we lost contact. He had a really tough upbringing and that sort of ventured him to where he was today. Another situation occurred last summer, parole violation, that ended him back in jail. I’ve been by his side since day 1, helping him out: mentally, financially as I can…and we have really connected on such an emotional level again. From the moment I first met him, had this deep connection, can’t even explain. I of course was a lot deeper than he was initially. But after these last couple months, reconnecting, working through his past/issues, being there for him when nobody else is….its now two sided. I was straight forward with my husband about him when we started talking and that I was helping him out, I didn’t want to come across as being sneaky. And honestly that was my only intentions just to reconnect see how he has been. Well after all these months, we’ve shared things with each other I’ve never told a soul, him as well. It’s almost like we were suppose to come back into each other’s lives at that very moment. My husband is extremely suspicious of him and me of course. I mean nothing physically has happened because of his situation. But we talk all the time on the phone, I’ve snuck away to visit him after promising I’d never would without my husband present, we’ve exchanged letters after being told to stop. I’ve definitely overstepped my bounds, which he doesn’t even know. My husband has been more than understanding with this entire messed up situation, probably more than anyone else would ever be. But I’m so torn, I think about him 24/7, miss him intensely, honestly feel as if this was always meant to be…because I’ve felt it from the beginning. I’m so torn. I would be giving up a good thing, good guy, my house, my truck, my life as I know it…to be with a criminal that I’ve always completely been in love with. I know statistically it never works out, he’s never given me any reason to think he’s lying to me…but what does he really have to offer besides his love. No job, no home, just a past of wrongs. I know I have what others would die for, but I feel like I’ve grown out of being in love with my spouse, to being in love with him. Help me! I have no idea what to do.</p>

            <p>I’m caught in a difficult situation and not sure what would be a sustainable solution….</p> 
            <p>My husband and I have been married for over 7 years, have two pretty fun and amazing kids. Overall he’s a good person, a good dad, but I’m just not attract to him. we’re eleven years apart. When we got married I was 25 and he was 36. At that point in life, I don’t think i was mature enough to know what i wanted in life. Then at age 27, I had my first child and my career certainly took a slow down. After the 2nd child, I was trying to regain the momentum in my career and headed to the graduate school. He’s been supportive in the process.</p> 
            <p>while in school, I met this other person, who also has two little kids. A bond was very quickly developed between us, and I knew he welcomed it. His wife is a really good person and mother. I’m not really sure where he stands in his marriage, but I do know he’s been a bit frustrated with his career outlook since the graduate school is more a of switch of career for him.</p> 
            <p>I certainly found him very attractive since the beginning. he’s kind of the opposite of my husband. He’s ambitious, affectionate and more assertive and bold in life. On the other hand, my husband is kind and very well educated but very mellow; he has a generally low emotional response to things. The guy from my school and I have come to the admission of our mutual attraction and we agreed that we wouldn’t want to be involved in a sexual relationship. So, we just end up hanging out together while working/studying… i think we both want more but we’re not willing to do it at the expense of breaking up our families. and neither of us wants this to stop as of now… we just enjoy each other’s company a lot.</p> 
            <p>I feel incredibly torn because I don’t know how and where this would take us. after the program is over, do we just stay as good friends living in separate states? do we just wait and see if the feelings will fade since we won’t be able to see each other much after the program? I know I’m going to miss him terribly but our lives probably won’t overlap again. he’s going to leave a void in my life that I wouldn’t know how to fulfill.</p>

            <p>I’ve been married 4 years. We’ve had our issues but nothing too too dramatic. I started a new job and met someone. She is married as well, and we started talking as friends but it quickly grew into more. I am deeply in love with her &amp; constantly think about being with her. I changed jobs again to keep from creating any issues at the work place in case things went south. Her husband found out she was having an affair &amp; they agreed to work it out but I still see her just not as often. My wife recently became pregnant as well but i still want to be with with the other woman. Please help</p>

            <p>Hi..<br> I have a problem. and I’m fully aware that the problem is me, somewhere inside me.<br> I’m 31 and have been married for 5 year and have 4 years old perfect son. during our marriage, most of the time we spend is being apart. I have a job that require me to be apart from my family as well as my wife with her job. we both love our job. we only meet once or twice a month only for a few days.<br> During this marriage I think I have fallen in love with another woman for two times (and I’m currently in love with the 2nd one). It’s been 2-3 years now after my first affair with the first woman.<br> It sounds so shallow but those woman has “higher class” than my wife. I felt like “hey, I can get intimate/close with a better quality woman”, Yes, those two woman is physically prettier than my wife and has a better personality.</p> 
            <p>I don’t know why I felt like that. I think I just don’t satisfied with my wife. I felt like a very bad person just thinking that I have that thought, but I don’t know why I have those kind of feeling. Sometimes I felt that I should be the un-married person, because I felt that I’m too vulnerable to in love with other woman.<br> I’m too afraid to bring devastation to my son, family and close friend if I leave my marriage for another woman,. and it will not guaranteed if I’m not repeat these things in the future.<br> I wish I could always have a feeling that I have with those paramour to my wife.</p>

            <p>Hi, I have been married for 6 years now. We have a boy of 5 years old. I believe I married my partner as I was in vulnerable point of my life. I found out that my ex fiance cheated on me with several women so I left to another country and promised myself not to ever marry anyone as I was scared of getting hurt and lost trust in man. After few years of being alone in a foreign country I met someone who was very nice to me and we shared the same christian values. I knew this person would never leave me or hurt me and it seemed there were a lot o signs that God was approving our friendships. I felt that finally I have someone that I can count on for the rest of my life and if I ever will have a child with anyone I would have it with him. I felt secure. I have convinced myself that I will love him and that attraction that wasn’t there would eventually appear as He is kind hearted and he loved me which was the most important thing right? Unfortunately nothing has changed. I am not attracted to my husband I tried hard but I love him like my brother. I realised how mistaken I was. I told him about it sometime after our boy was born and He agreed to live in a marriage with no intimacy because he cannot imagine breaking family unit and He loved me. One day I met someone that I felt is my soul mate. Same cultural background thinking interests similar situation at home and we fell in love. I got involved and it’s been a year now. He also has children with his wife who it seems also made the same mistake as me. Additionally they married young. He wants me to leave my husband and start new life with him and that we should give a chance for our partners to find their true love. We will be 40 years old soon. He says we still have time to build a new life together. I hate the thought of leaving my husband as I know he loves me the way I can’t. I think he deserves a new life and someone who will appreciate him, but doesn’t want it. Our boy is our priority and having two parents in one home is very important, however, is it ok for him to be raised in a family where there’s no intimacy and it shows? Do we all have to now pay the price for the sake of our child having both parents under one roof? I admit when I met my husband I was very vulnerable alone in a foreign country and it felt like the right thing to do. No excuses here. I lied to myself. I wasn’t myself. We now live in a different country and it seems I have changed, I came back to being the person I once was before my ex fiancée hurt me and I am ready to take the risk to be with also a very kind person, however, from the same cultural background and someone I am actually attracted to. My marriage should have never happened in the first place or am I mistaken because God allow it and I should stay for the sake of my boy? Is my husband and I a good example for our boy who will one day find out the truth? Is having both parents under one roof the most importantimportant thing? If so.. I am happy to sacrifice my happiness if that’s the case.</p>

            <p>Hi.. im all the way hailing from an Asia country. I dont know how to start off… i’ll try to make this as short as possible.. i have been married for 5years., the problem with us both is that we do not have a third party. its more of like i am sick n tired of him taking advantage of me n not providing for me financially. its only after 4yrs of marriage that we got twins. the twins we had wasnt done out of love. its by scientific method. i.e. i had to underwent minor op just to get my fallopian unblocked, etc. I know that he will not change his ways of being a lazy ass person who is choosy when it comes to job offers, rude, hot tempered n he also has hit me before too, etc. still i sucked it in and endured it all. It was only recently that he got me into trouble with the law for something that i did not do and we were lucky to get away with paying fines only but still.. i think its the last straw for me this time as he has gotten out of hands n if i were to stay put still n endure again, i cannot imagine wad he will next, maybe got me into something bigger that will cost my life next? Thing is, he showed me that he is in such a remorseful state n so on but i am in the state where i am emotionless already. U know, when the word HATE &amp; LOVE can never be in this context anymore. Its like even if he told he would change and all i just dont care.. its not that i dont want to believe him its because i just cant at all and i have no more feelings not even a bit at all. To me, i no longer care about him n i told him that even he changed, it would be for the benefit of another woman n i swear on my life that i would be happy for him. The problem here is, i wanted so much to file for a divorce but my mum just wont allow me to do so as shes a firm believer that marriage is for keeps. i love so much that i would do anything for her. but each passing day, its killing me inside that i have to face this jerk. What should i do?</p>

            <p>Hi….I will try to keep this very complicated story short. I was married for 25 years , and very proud of the fact that I never cheated in all that time. But it was not a blissful marriage at all, we had not been intimate with each other for many years, hardly did anything together except fought. The last 4 years of our marriage were spent with us sleeping in different rooms. I could not take it any longer, and began to look around. I fell quickly for a woman I met on line, it was so refreshing to get some attention. I fell very hard for her long before the physical part began. I should mention that she too was in a long term marriage. But I knew that I could not leave my marriage, and was very torn from it. But my new lover made that decision for me when I found that she was seeing other men besides me. I was devastated, and who could I talk to about this all? I certainly could not ask my wife who was the first person I thought of. It made me realize that even though we were not getting along like a healthy married couple, that I still depended on her. I tried very hard to forget the other woman, but the brief taste of happiness was too much to ignore. I browsed the web for answers, even went as far as placing an ad on the dating site we had originally met, hoping my lover would come back to me. I got a response from another woman, we spoke for nearly a year and became very close. But I would never meet her, since she was single and a dangerous choice if I was still going to try and figure out my marriage. But one day I caved in and met her. And it was wonderful to be loved again. I went as far as to take her to a huge family event with my families permission, my younger brothers wedding instead of my wife. Of course things escalated at that point, since we were seen in public word got back to my wife and things got very ugly. The divorce was hurtful to all, so much was lost and destroyed out of spite and vindictiveness. It took many years to recover from that. But I will say that never once did I regret my decision of leaving. However there is another twist. My current wife does not have children of her own, and as a result she resents mine, has interfered with my relationship with them etc. History is also repeating itself, we have not slept together in a few years., fight all the time etc. And again I went out looking, found a nice woman, fell in love, found out she was seeing other men, had my heart trampled on…and found another woman, single too. But this one is amazing! I’ve never felt so much love from anyone before. She really feels like my soul mate, we complete each others sentences for each other, and have an incredible amount of similar likes, rather identical likes. I’ve tried to keep things in perspective, tried to see that the only reason she seems so nice is because of how unhappy I have been. But it’s not working, I know what love is and this is true love. I hear what you guys are saying, that it will not last. But does it last in a conventional relationship anyway? I mean I remember falling in love before, but never like this. Its like my soul is on fire<br> when I am with her. I know what I need to do, but I do not want to hurt my spouse. Believe it or not I do lover her, I always will. She will always be a part of me, and my life. But I am not in love with her anymore. Any advice?</p>

            <p>Hi Mr Beam ! </p> 
            <p>I desperately need your advice as to whether my situation is a lost cause. Please tell me if its to late to turn things around. In the beginning I was immature and didn’t forgive his transgressions.I wanna show him I’ve matured. Is my situation salvageable, Can I save my family? </p> 
            <p>I’ve been reading your articles and listening to your radio segments and I agree completely with your teachings. I have always thought this way,even before discovering your site 6 months ago. I believe every relationship can be repaired with work and anyone can fall victim to making bad choices.</p> 
            <p>I’m a single mom of two children age 2 and 4. And I’ve been fighting for my ex and my family since late 2012. Everyone thinks I should move on, I’ve tried to but, I keep wavering back. I want my love and my family. A life that was stolen from us. Please help provide me clarity. </p> 
            <p>Here’s a bit of my story. </p> 
            <p>Back when I was 23 In 2009 I met my Ex.Prior to meeting him I had never really dated, in the conventional sense. I was a virgin saving myself for marriage. </p> 
            <p>In 2010 he and I became engaged; Legally we were common law married. But never officially married by a pastor. The first two years of our relationship were great then he pushed me away and dumped me out of the blue. I was heart broken Almost a month later he begged for me to return. What I didn’t know was that he had cheated on me with a fake friend. When I found out I was devastated. If it wasn’t already a difficult situation I discovered I was also pregnant.<br> So here I was betrayed, pregnant and hormonal. He just wanted me to get over it and be happy. I couldn’t stop dwelling on my pain/anger and reminded him of his mistake when ever I felt broken.. Which being pregnant made it all the time. </p> 
            <p>In Canada you get a full year Maternity leave. We had agreed we would leave for my year but at the last minute he bailed. He abandoned me after my baby was born and I spent my year off with my father. He wasn’t involved with our child But I still figured we were a family. Once my year was over I returned to the town to work. Only I discovered while I was raising our baby he had cheated on me again with 2 people: the same girl again during the summer and then another chick for a few months. I was heart broken.. But I stupidly still loved him and Found out i was pregnant with baby number 2.<br> He was furious, told me I was f**king his life up, he didn’t want anything to do with the kids. according to him they were his biggest mistakes and regrets. </p> 
            <p>I quickly discovered he was cheating on me with a younger girl who had a trashy reputation. He left us for her while I was still pregnant. I didn’t talk to him for almost 2 years we went to court and I have full custody of my kids. That relationship with the mistress lasted just over a year. she was messing around with a lot of guys. It Would have ended sooner if she wasn’t still in school But the Long distance dragged it out.<br> Hes claimed he wishes he could do things over with me. But says since I couldn’t forgive him the first time we will never work. I’ve tried to show him love, and it breaks my heart to see how he’s fallen. He isn’t a dad and doesn’t try to be.. He’s now fallen into a new limerence and would rather pursue this new relationship vs fixing things with his family. </p> 
            <p>I’ve apologized to him for my part in our situation. I selfishly didn’t forgive and treat him with love and understanding when I was hurt. So my behavior contributed to his decisions even though ultimately he’s fully responsible ,I’m not without some blame. </p> 
            <p>But deep down I know we could be great again. If we were actually given the chance. Now no matter what I say, he just sees me as the nag, I don’t know how to break down the wall so he can see the loving forgiving woman I am.. I have so much love for him that it hurts. I’ve seen him at his worst.. My daughters and I have experienced his worst, and yet we still love him. He has so much potential to be a wonderful man. I want that man back.. Who he’s being is horrible, but who he is, deep down is a sensitive and caring guy<br> With a lot of unresolved anger.<br> I should mention I just turned 31 he’s turning 29 and this new girl is 26.<br> I wish I knew then what I know now… How do I get a chance to show him we are his life, he belongs with me and his children. Instead of writing us off as a impossibility. This is 7 years of my life, and I want to make it Forever!<br> Please help me Joe!!!!<br> Is it ok to still fight for him. To love him or do I need to cut the ties for my own Sanity and health. I wanna be the best mom for my children, they will always come first. So if this is just going to hurt me, I won’t be a great mom, if I’m broken. I just need to know if my desire to fight is worth it. I think it is but maybe I’m hoping and grasping because I foolishly want what I want. </p> 
            <p>Please help this “torn soul”<br> Do I try to ignite this fire or put it asunder. I know the love I have for him is a true,pure love.</p> 
            <p>Thank you so much, I pray you have a blessed day!</p>

            <p>I’m lost and don’t know what to do. I’m 22 and my husband is 27. We have been married for 2 and half years now, but have been together for a total of 7. When we first got married he did have “cold feet” after and I found out he was talking to one of his co-workers. I quickly confronted him about it and he said he would stop talking to said co-worker and would work on our issues. Last November he decided to join the military. This march is when he started Basic training and finished this week. All throughout the training he wrote to me and kept as much communication with me as he could. But yesterday when he finally got his phone back he called me to say that he was done with our marriage and wanted a divorce. He said he is in love with his co-worker and that they have been together for a year. He never gave me signs that he was feeling this bad about things. And when we would have our rough patches I made sure to ask him if he still wanted to continue this relationship and he always said yes. He says he came to this conclusion because of his 10 weeks of basic training. I don’t know what to think or how to feel. What hurt me the most is that he had his new gf there at his graduation. I still love him soo much, but is my marriage really over?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p> 
            <p>This is a hard situation I’m a Elder at my church, and a married woman but I’m struggling with my flesh and I’m falling in love with a Man that I meet. I know this is wrong but he seems so right. My husband don’t go to church as much as he use too and he is in an organization call Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. It seems like this organization is first in his life and I’m getting to the point that I’m tired of telling him how I feel about our marriage and it seems to me that he is not doing anything about it. I really love him and pray that we can work through the issues. Some of the problems I’m having is him spending time with that organization, working late hours, not showing or giving the love, affection and real passion I need this marriage . He is a great person and It’s nothing he won’t do for me and our daughter but I feel like we are in a buddy relationship. He don’t kiss and I love kissing because it stimulates you to other things at times. I do feel lonely in the marriage and seeing our people really showing passion and love in there relationships. I try not to compare but I’m young and I feel like I’m missing out on a lot!! He have crazy hours for work and he usually gets home “LATE”. I preach and I teach the word but now I’m reaching out for help and for you to pray for me because I’m getting weak. It’s funny, how the Lord directed me to this site; because what I’m preaching on is being in tight places, how do you come out of tight places? Now, I’m going through what I’m preaching and teaching about; and I see it on your web site. I used David for my example II Samuel 11 and 12 and I see you had that on your website. Wow, the Lord will direct your path!! It was amazing seeing and reading the story again. Thanks so much, but the tight place is really getting hard to come out even though I know how to come out it’s just really HARD because I’m falling in LOVE with HIM!!! I never cheated on my husband before and I don’t want to know but I’m missing that passion in our marriage. The guy I meet is 12yrs older than me and he lost his wife 10yrs ago and I don’t really know but he is really nice and it seems like we been knowing each other forever and I feel really loved by him and wanted. I could just stay in his arms all day long and I would feel protected and loved. It’s not all sexual but he open up my eyes of what I’ve been missing all these years and I let a lot of stuff go by me with my husband but now I can SEE! I’ve been married for 13yrs on May 25th. It was really nice but it wasn’t really romantic like I wanted to be. He often tells me sex is overrated and that he is old. I know he might be playing but he is 45yrs and I’m 47yrs and we are still young but he always says that. I know we supposed to speak life not death! I don’t want to be in a marriage and I feel like I’m just a buddy to him and miss out on being loved. Right now I feel lonely and miserable. He checks my e-mail and phone and the GPS to see where I go and I just don’t want to live a life feeling in bondage. That’s why I’m using my work e-mail because he can see everything. We do have a 12yr daughter we loved so much but I’m really at a CROSSROAD!! Please help. I will continue to seek Jesus and pray and maybe even fast. I’m really feeling some kind of way and I always want to be with this man because of the way I connect with him and the feeling I get when I’m with him. But I do love my husband; I reached out to him several of times and he says that everything is fine and he don’t want any marriage counseling but I don’ t know what to do but I’m feeling guilty because of who I am in the Lord. I know it’s not right but I am at a CROSS ROAD!! Thanks for taking time to read this and praying for me. Please HELP ME!!! God blessed you too!  I</p>

            <p>I just turned 24 and have been married for 2 and a half years. Together with my husband for about 5 years now. My husband was basically a kid in the beginning of our relationship. I was willing to wait on him to learn the do’s and don’ts of relationships considering he caused his mom and sister to hate me by going to them about even the tiniest things. He didn’t take responsibility for a lot of things and always let his mother be in the relationship. He was too afraid and stubborn to drive even though he knew I hated to. Just before we got married he had joined the army and I was at home and work reviewing our relationship. I felt like he wouldn’t change those things although I asked him to many times and quickly began to doubt a marriage with him. I came to the decision of leaving him and because I was still deeply in love with him I felt like the 10 page letter I wrote him explaining myself wouldn’t be enough once he calls and says he wants to stay. Sense I wanted to stick by my decision and not bend even a little I decidedto ssleep with a co-worker so that I could tell him and he would hate me and it would all be over with. I hated myself because I slept with someone I felt didn’t deserve me and was ashamed to go to church. When he called it was obvious he didn’t get the breakup letter so I knew for sure it was over. He was upset with me which I was prepared for and yet he still didn’t understand why I was trying to leave him in the first place. Finally he decided to marry me anyway and promised that those problems wouldn’t be in the marriage. Well after he graduated basics and we moved in together it was like things got worse. I would stop cleaning his messes in exchange for him to start trying for his license sense I had to go and do everything with him. He would instead call his mom and have her talk to me telling me what my role of a wife should be. Dealt with a lot of the same things as I went on and off strike for not much progress to be done. We were already doing counseling for little things, but later on in our first year of marriage he finally brought up what I did. He got extremely mad yelled that I was a bitch and walked out during the session. So again I was regretful of my actions but not long after we left and I drove him to his next destination he seemed happy and with a smile asked me for a hall pass and said he had someone in mind. At first because I felt so hurt and regretful I said yes, but let me know when he wants to do it. He said he changed his mind but later started acting completely mean towards me. Stopped leaving his phone around and would yell at me if I so much as tried to look at it while it was in his hand. Yell at me for wanting to go to the living room to watch tv with him. Yell if I entered a room without knocking. I stayed in denial. He became very depressed as time went on still treating me the same and not accepting my help when I lovingly offered. Even called my mother around the holidays wanting me to leave immediately for her surgery that wasn’t even scheduled. When I finally left he told me he was leaving me for someone else. At first I begged and tried to convince him other wise, but as the days passed so did my self worth and I ended up accepting it. He later called begging me to stay with him because he was being framed by a fake sargent who said she would report him if he didn’t leave me. His story was he got online to find people to talk to while I was away and he did all night dutys. I talked with her myself and tricked her into confessing what was going on. So I forgave him and told him not to fall for a stupid trick like that again. It was march when I got back and like any couple we made loveaafter not seeing eachother for so long. Two days later I had to pick him up from a health clinic and he tells me he gave me a std. His mom gets involved before I can even be mad and attacks me saying I cheated on him along with other degrading things to bring me down and justify her son. A lot of bad emotional things take place and he swore it was only one girl saying it happened when he got drunk. I forgave him until he wanted to continue being mean to me and protective of his phone the day of my doctors appointment. He yelled at me” you’re pissing me off” and what seemed like him trying to brake his phone. I got up from my calm and peaceful state and punched him four times. Pushed him once hoping he would fight back and threw him to the floor. More stupid things happened between me and his mother and he went to a phyc ward. While he was there I had a big feeling there was more. I hacked his accounts and found him sending pics to multiple women embracing his marriage wanting an affair and trying to meet up with more than I can count. He swore he wanted me yet got upset after I told him i knew the truth and what I did to get it. Everyone i know along with strangers from God tell me to not give up on him and give him another chance. It took half a year to forgive him after he left me and swore he would file for divorce which is what I first wanted. Because I was again heart broken from him leaving me i tried to move on and got into a different relationship. It didn’t last long and I only wanted it for a distraction of my pain but ended up sleeping with the guy which made me leave him sense I didn’t want that to happen again. Not expecting it me and my husband get back together even though I tried to move on and had sex. Not long after he leaves me again and falls in love with a co worker. I am now pregnant and every time he asked to start things over he would always talk about her and everything he liked about her. I refused him more than once and each time he went back to the woman who was also stuck between him and her two kids father. He almost caused me to misscarry because of all the stress he put me through. Although I love him still and he has said that all his feelings for her are gone and wants to start over. .. I am growing hatred towards him and how he treated me like a backup while always showing me how more important she was. I want this but I can feel each day I tey to make sense of things that my love for him is turning into hate and I will not be hurt again.</p>

            <p>I’m 24 years old and I’ve been married to my wife for three years and working on different state away from home. My wife and I were not really good in communicating by long distance because both of us are busy at work. We have a son who’s going turn 3 years old next month. Since last year, I started working in a non-profit organization and just 2 weeks ago, we had training which was held in another country. I met this korean girl at the same organization I’m working with, she’s sweet, nice and very friendly. We had a few conversation until such time I began felt attracted to her. Over the 2 weeks in the training, I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I tried to reach my wife over social media but she’s always busy at her business and our communication are inconsistent. I know it was wrong to start engaged with this girl while I’m married but, my heart always keep seeking her. Sometimes I’d rather think that I just feel so lonely and need someone to comfort with all my stress and problems. During the last day of our training, I went to see her in her hotel room and had a serious talk. I confessed of how I feel about her and she just got flattered and thanked me but, I couldn’t tell if what she felt about me that night . What I wanted was to get all out everything in the chest. After our conversation, we gave each other a serious hug and pause for like 3-5 seconds and then I asked her phone number for keeping in touch. When both of us says farewell, I felt so lonely and I miss her very badly. Today, I haven’t started even a single chat on her on Facebook or send her a text message because a part of me doesn’t want to start to engage and another part me wanting her. I love my wife and my son but my relationship towards family are now so distant while me having crazy feelings about this another girl. I just don’t want to feel bad for my family. Just sharing this and I would like to hear your thoughts. Thanks.</p>

            <p>If my wife were writing this I believe below is what she would say about our marriage. I found this posted a couple of years ago from someone else. As a husband and father that wants to save our marriage and is working to identify and remove all of these self righteous, prideful actions from myself how do I get that one more chance from my wife that has said she is done and does not want to try and save the marriage. Due to our kids activities we see each other almost everyday and are very nice to each other but very little discussion about “us”. My wife has shared her feelings and what she wants but does not see that with me. I have suspect but to the point I don’t have a reason to believe some else is involved. She wants to be “True to herself”</p> 
            <p> “I’ve been married for 15 years and have 6 kids. During the 15 years, I gave 100% of me to my spouse. He had been both verbally and emotionally abusive for pretty much the whole time with some nice days here and there. I begged cried and pleaded for him to please stop being mean, ignoring me, disrespecting me, walking on me, hurting me in every way imaginable except physically. Three weeks ago I told my husband I was done because I couldn’t take it anymore. Now he is pleading with me to stay and he’s sorry and will do whatever it takes to change and save our marriage. If I’m honest, I don’t want to save it. It’s been a long painful road and I’m having trouble forgetting what he has done to make me put up the wall I now have.The thought that there is love out there that will build me up and I will be equal and loved, makes me want to find it. I need help. I’m battling guilt of wanting to give up but honestly, I don’t know how to fight for something that’s meant so much to me and nothing to him and now it means everything to him. I’m having trouble. Please, any advice helps”</p>

            <p>Hi, I am in a very horrible situation. I was with my first love for 4 years, and have practically known him all my of life, since I was in my early twenties. We had a very rocky relationship, due to emotional baggage on both sides and after quite an intense 4 years, we split up. He was the love of my life. After a year of being single,During the year, I took the time out to get to know myself and heal. My ex also did the same, he went to therapy, got his life back on track, etc. After the year I thought I was ready for another relationship and so I met a wonderful man and had a very fairytale like relationship with him for 6 months, before we got married. a few months in to our marriage, I started feeling things for my ex, I would think about him all the time, hope that he was ok, and part of me was mourning him, like he was dead. After about 3 months in to my marriage, my ex contacts me. It turns out that he also took the time to heal himself during our break up. He underwent therapy, got his life in order, taking on his responsibilities, and he is now finally the man that I have been yearning for the past 17 years. He told me how much he loves me and that going in to therapy, sorting himself out made him realised that he and I were always meant for one another. I tried to block out my feelings, but I just cant do it anymore. I cry everyday, I feel like he has died all over again and I cant even look my husband in the eyes anymore. I struggle to be intimate with him as well. My husband is a good guy. he knows of my ex and is also aware of my history with him. My husband even says to me lately that he sees this sadness in my eyes and he knows that I am heartbroken over another man. I feel so guilty for hurting my husband like this, I feel like I have ruined his life by entrapping him in to a marriage and a mere 3-6 months later ruining everything. I have decided to stay with my husband, but not because I want to make it work with him but because I feel guilty and I feel like he is too fragile to handle the truth. I am so miserable everyday. Every second of the day I think of my ex, my soul mate and imagine my life with him and the family that we should have had.<br> Please help me. What do I do?</p>

            <p>I have been married for likely 2 years now,and accepting my husband’s proposal was the hardest thing I’ve ever done.I liked him, and logically he was the right person for me.He knows me and helps me to achieve my dreams.but the hardest part was/is it was a setting marriage,we didn’t fell in love and marry,and in the time I had a huge crush on someone whom I had kissed once, which after my marriage he became closer more than a friend to me. I tried really hard to be the perfect wife,I know my husband deserves it, but I can’t be faithful. I have this feeling that I made a big mistake,marrying someone by logic not love. And now after 2 years of trying and disappointing my husband and family, I feel I’m in love with the other person, I didn’t let myself to have sex with him, but I know I’m mentally cheating.I feel awful. My husband once saw our texts and didn’t speak to me for a week.I now I may end my marriage, I don’t want to. But still I didn’t know that I could still be much alive and loved by someone the way he treats and kisses me. I’m not a bad person, I just don’t know what to do….</p>

            <p>I’ve been married for twelve years, my husband and I had gotten married already having trust issues. He had a relationship with another woman being engaged to me. He broke it off with her and proceeded to honor me and we quickly got married. Being married to him after a while I noticed a lot more porn issues and made my relationship hard with him, I hid a lot of issues I had with him and never addressed how bad our situation was. I soon after he left for a while found something “new” with someone else. We both we’re married and had been put in situations we’re be both ended our affair. My husband forgave me and we made it work with a lot of compromises and I knew he loved me with all his heart. We decide on having another child after already having three. I thought the bond between us would be stronger and would fulfill our marriage and make us stronger than ever! I was so wrong!!! He had an affair with my best friend while she lived in our home and I was helping her overcome some marriage issues she was having. Long story short, she passed away in a horrible accident, soon after her passing I found out about their affair. I knew deep down in my gut that he longed for her and was heartbroken. He lied to me about the truth of the reality they both had in their affair, I’m sure it was so he wouldn’t hurt me more than he had. I was suicidal and felt so lost. I gained weight and was terribly depressed. I again thought maybe uniting our marriage through church would have a positive impact on my self esteem and maybe we would be whole again. I was disappointed again discovering a picture of her through his email. I felt cheated and lied to again and everything he was hiding from me, while all I ever wanted was his full honesty, I felt like I at least needed that from him from all the pain he’d put me through. I decided one day I was done with him and took off my wedding ring. I told him I needed time and I needed to end things because I couldn’t continue this relationship with him based on lies. He then decided to not only tell me they did have an emotional affair but also a sexual one. The problem is that I started to feel empty and lost again and can’t and won’t believe him anymore. This all lead me to find the man I had an affair with many years ago,. We have connected and he’s made me feel valued as a woman and I have started to find myself again. We both are married with children and his relationship with his wife has been hell since the affair we both had a long time ago. He has decided to leave his marriage and become happy again. I have given him time to really think things through as well as myself. The problem is that I’m here with my spouse and children because I feel like I give up on them if I leave the marriage. My heart is somewhere else and can’t put the effects of my destroyed marriage into something positive with my spouse. I don’t like the person he made me to be and he hurt me a lot over the last couple years. I find myself wondering if I leave this marriage how will things be in my life and if I stay will I ever be happy again. My soul is lost and hurt. As much as I would “try” again I can’t seem to allow myself to ever want to put myself in the hands of someone who broke me so bad. I feel bad for our situation and I feel bad for my husband even though he’s lied to me so much! I deep down inside myself feel as if I can’t ever trust him again and don’t want to ever… truth is I still don’t believe the things he’s said to me about the affair, I will always feel insecure about the marriage and won’t ever believe him. Is this my cue to leave him? Not to remarry the other man but to find myself and value myself again. I’d like to try being alone for a while before dating again. I guess it’s a loss for all of us even though my feelings for another man could be real. Any advice?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p> 
            <p>I’ve been married for 6 years but my relationship with my husband is 13 years overall including the boyfriend girlfriend stage. Sadly, within our 2nd year of marriage my husband had an affair with his ex girlfriend, then again this year with a different woman, a coworker. I found it out through his messenger history and have seen that the last one lasted for 5months, the only reason he stopped sending messages to the other woman is because she blocked her. When I told him that I knew about it I made him choose. But of course as exoected since the other woman didnt eant to speak with him anymore he said he will always choose me and our son.<br> The truth is, I cannot get myself to forget what he did, I cannot get myself to forgive and trust him again. I honestly think he only chose me because the other woman didnt want him anymore but if she did..he would surely continue with the affair. What hurts the most is how differently he treated the other woman compared to how badly he treats me. I came to a point when I already called a lawyer to ask on how I can file for legal separation. I dont know what to do. Im still in pain and I still feel hurt everytime I remember. Help please.<br> As much as I would like to attend workshops or marriage counseling which you currently offer it wont be possible because I’m from another country.</p>

            <p>I have been married for 20 years and we have 2 children. I have been unhappy for most of the marriage. Mainly just stayed for our children. I’ve met a man that also has been married for 20 years. He has 3 children and is also in a marriage unhappily. I’ve known him for 3 years, but only just in the last 2 months did we both discover that we both were in similar situations. We have been secretly seeing one another for the past two months. I have since filed for divorce, he has not. I am so happy when we are together. We have the same values, interests, and neither one of us has ever cheated on our spouses before. Everything seems wonderful when are together. I am not sure if he is ready or willing to leave his wife, but I know he cares very deeply for me. What should I do?</p>

            <p>Hi, I am married for 11 years now with my first boyfriend. We have 2 kids and things are really running close to perfect in our family. I have a loving husband and he’s been the only man I’ve been with (in fact my first boyfriend and first in everything). I’ve recently reunited with my childhood love in a class reunion and I didn’t expect the strong attraction I felt for him. It’s like I was transported back in time when all I ever wanted was to be his girlfriend and wife. What surprised me more was that the feeling was mutual. He said that he was devastated when I left our town and he never saw me again. We spent one night together and we’re still in contact since then (we live in different states). I know this is wrong since he as well has a partner already. I know this has to stop the soonest but I just can’t dismiss the idea that this is a second chance for me to show him the love that I kept for a long time before I even met my husband. My chance to experience how it would be like to be his girl. Whatever we have right now makes me really happy but I’m not really planning to leave my husband for him. To me, i just want it to be like having my first boyfriend that I wasn’t given a chance before.</p>

            <p>I have been with my husband for 7 years and married for 3 years, we have one child together, every time we get in a serious argument he brings up the word divorce,since marriage he is a different person, never lesson to reason and just snaps for no reason, i have suggested marriage counseling and anger management coarse but he wont hear of it, for the past few months my ex and i had been in contact, we both married with family’s but it seems the spark has resurfaced , the only reason we broke up was because he got a job out of the country, he wants us to get back together and even suggested he will file a divorce first, i know the grass is not always greener on the other side but it was one of my relationships, please help.</p>

            <p>I have been married for 29 years. He has grown close with a friend that is a girl. He does not want to have a sexual relationship with her but just a friendship, but he likes to be with her when ever possible. We have talked about it. I have agreed friendship is okay. Lunch once in a while is okay- but anything else is off limits. I do not want to share his heart with anyone. At this point in time it’s either except this or I don’t have him. He loves me but I am pretty sure he loves her to. I have no idea what to do. Is this possible or am I stupid!</p>

            <p>my husband and I have been together for 11 years and married for 9. we have two beautiful children together ages 2 and 7. For 7Years (since having our first born) he has been absent in many ways. Hes not been involved in making memories with our kids or as a family, hates going out and doing anything whether its a date or family time. He lives his life on Youtube or XBOX and we have pretty much been living separate lives for the 7 years. I had gone to him numerous times telling him I need more and that I wasn’t happy and always got the “this is who I am” speech and nothing was ever fixed. About 4 months ago i got involved with my coworker and we both have fallen madly inlove with each other. He wants me to be happy, even if its not with him (which he desperately wants a life with me). He has two kids of his own and is a wonderful father and loves to go out and do things with them which makes my heart so full and happy. He wants nothing more than to have a life with me and my kids and make our memories together. My husband just found out about my affair and wants to make things right and work out in our marriage. Hes willing to go to therapy together and interact more which he has been doing (going out of his way to be present in every way possible and help around the house which is wonderful.) however, i feel empty when we make love or even kiss. While hes doing everything ive asked for, i feel like its too late. My concern is that i feel this way because i have strong feelings for my other half (who calls me his soul mate). We have the same interests and feelings. Im so scared to make the wrong choice. Basically, im inlove with someone new, but is it because its new? I feel like im inlove with my past, BEFORE kids. i Just don’t want to regret. i don’t want to stay and be unhappy and i don’t want to end it and wonder what if. i don’t know what to do.</p>

           <div class="comment-content"> 
            <p>27 years married ,two grown sons and a grandson. Apparently she has been pretending to love me while in an affair with a married man. She has been under a lot of stress with her father’s health and our financial status. I take responsibility for the financial side, it’s been rough and shes been working her ass off. I’m not sure how long, possibly 2 years seeing this man. She made like it was recent and then said 10 months, she approached him…but no sex yet. This is completely out of her character. During the breakup she stated “she loved me but not like she should for a long time” for the last six months we have gotten a little closer like when we were young, having amazing sex almost every night. I would also look into hers for the “I love you” statement and was assured we were ok. I found out she told my sons and others she planned on leaving me 2 weeks pryor to the breakup she was preparing an apartment to move out building me up for the letdown. Her plan was disrupted early from thislast fight. During the breakup fight I asked her if she loved this man and she said “im in love” I told her “how can you be in love with this man and have sex with me every night for the last 6 months” I told her she didn’t love him or she would not do that. To me or him if love was involved. I understand some of the things she said was part of her plan to leave and make hate her. In my mind, you love someone or you don’t and would have been better if shwould have said she did not love me anymore. She says the man just happened and not the reason she is leaving. Im dealing with this as we speak. I feel this was two years in the making and has left me with nothing and confused living a lie. Even my sons have taken her side and will not speak to me. Im hurt badly, embarrassed and lost without words. I left the state immediately have not spoken to her. I’m dealing with this alone in an extra home of a relative almost a month out and almost lost what mind I have left. She has been a good Christian humble woman for many years and totally caught me off guard. I never would have thought she would have treated me this way. Never* I’ve lost everything that I cared about at 52 years old. 27 years vanished right before my eyes. Devistated beyond repair.</p>

            <p>Should I forward this article to my husband? He has “feelings” for someone else and is considering leaving our marriage. He is lost and confused about what to do and I think this might help, but if it comes from me, it might be too pushy.</p>

            <p>I miss my affair partner even though things ended very badly between us. We spent four years together, and we went through many ups and downs, struggled through accepting each others flaws, differences, supported each other through death of loved ones, argued at times about child raising issues, and knowing the love we felt for each other wasn’t right because we are both married to other people. Needless to say we were far from in limerance bliss but we loved each other. We ended things because it was the right thing to do for the sake of our spouses and children. We both miss talking, sharing our lives together, even the arguments, and frustrations. We both hurt each other and never want to hear from each other ever again because of the pain we caused for ourselves. Sometimes doing what is right feels so very empty and having to sacrifice my true happiness has been devestating. He was the only man I felt true love. Very different from the how I have pretended to be happy with the man I married to make my parents happy. I was too young to decide or understand what love really is when I was 18. Life is now meaningless without the one I love in my life.</p>

            <p>I have been with my husband for about 10 years. Although I love him he treats me very poorly. Some may say abusive or bordering on abusive. I talked to friend a few months ago looking for support and they were also going through a really difficult time in their marriage. I have not done anything but definitely have come to really care about this man. We built a really strong connection and talk every day. We have not been physical but have talked about wanting to just know we can’t. I care about this person so much b and I am also so unhappy in my current situation. I know nothing can really happen but I am just lost.</p>

            <p>Hi, I’m happily married but I have feelings for a good friend of mine who I had known before my wife. Infact she introduced my wife to me. I actually wanted my friend then but she was in a relationship so I didn’t pursue. I later got to know about a year ago that the feeling was mutual even then and still is. Now I can’t seem to get over the thought that I missed out on the one I really wanted. She is married too but experiences some unkindess from her husband. And has declared her love for me. I love her too and don’t know what to do</p>

            <p>18 years ago I was forced by my family to Marry. I had two children my eldest was 6 the other was 3 my first husband had passed away and I was raising my children alone. My family pushed me into getting married again because they were afraid that my children and I would have a hard time without being married without a man in my life. Well stupid me I listened and within three months I was remarried and this gentleman had two teenage girls. Well long story short it’s been 18 years we do not have children together thank goodness. well the first five years was pretty good wasn’t great but it was pretty good he’s a good provider when it comes to work out of the house when it comes to work in the house I do everything he sits and watches TV and plays on the computer.<br> The past 10 years have been horrible we no longer sleep in the same bed, we sleep in the same room but we have separate beds we don’t do anything together and it’s not that I don’t want to do anything it’s he doesn’t want to do anything so like I said for the past 10 years this is what it’s been like. Well about six months ago I met someone who is a widower and we have so much in common there is no intimacy with us I will not do that I believe one relationship needs to end before you start another especially if there’s going to be in intimacy issues My issue is if I leave this marriage I leave with nothing but the clothes on my back my children are now older my baby is 21 in college and ready to move out my oldest is already on his own I have talked to them about this and they told me that they would not get mad upset because they need to see me happy.<br> I am falling deeply in love with this gentleman and I’m not sure how to go about doing this. I love my husband I always will but I am or I was never in love with him. Our marriage is a marriage of convenience for him to have someone take care of him and for me to have the Financial support<br> This gentleman wants to take care of me wants to be part of my life wants to be my equal and wants me to move in with him but I don’t want to hurt my husband I’m not sure how to go about this I’ve talk to him He knows about this gentleman he doesn’t know him personally but he does know of him because I was honest enough and I told him I do not want to live a lie in my marriage I’m hoping you have some advice for me</p>

            <p>Me and my wife have been married for 4 years. We have two beautiful children but for about a year or so I have felt the connection slip, the desire fade. Iv always had feelings for one of my ex’s, the “first” or so to say. I just reconnected with her and she told me that she had always loved me and just never thought I would feel the same. But I do, I love this girl and I feel like I just “settled” with my currently wife because of pregnancy. So iv been emotionally connected to this girl for close to 10 years, the first kiss, first crush, everything to me, as I was to her. But I don’t know what to do, iv been with my wife for 4 years and we have kids together. But if I’m not happy when I wake up then is it still worth it?</p>

            <p>Hi, I don’t even know how to start but I need help.<br> I will try to keep the story as short as I can..</p> 
            <p>I have been with my husband for almost 9years and married for almost 8! During the initial year we only saw each other on weekends due to work commitments. We then decided to get married and moved to the UK immediately. I had been in a mentally abusive relationship before. I thought my husband could be the one and look after me, care and give me all I need for eternity. He is an absolutely lovely person and cares and loves for me very much. However, I have been on and off (more so since of recent) feeling distant from him but he doesn’t realise this. I am a very lively bubbly person who loves to have fun, be adventurous and I absolutely love being adored and having as they say a world-wind of a romance (this is all I’ve ever wanted since I was in my teens/early twenties). I go out with work colleagues drinking, dancing etc but he never wants to go out. Even if he does he wants to go to some quiet place just for the two of us.. I physically don’t feel connected either and sometimes have to really try. I am emotionally drained. I have tried to tell Him about this on 2-3 occasions but it just doesn’t work out. I have had flings during my marriage due to these reasons and that someone else makes me feel wanted and awakens my soul. My husband is unaware of them and they never reached to a physical level more than a kiss. We don’t have children. </p> 
            <p>I know my boss for about 5years and we have always felt connected but due to our marriages we never declared anything. He’s 30years my senior and he is still married but lives seperate lives for the past 25years. Recently we told each other how we feel and I am absolutely head over heals about this man and he makes me feel alive! I do the same for him. I know that this might never be fruitful but i cannot seem to get out of it and with the continuous lack of emotional and physical connection with my husband I don’t even know if I should carry on with my marriage.<br> I’m also now scared to break it off with this other guy as I feel he will be nasty to me during work. He never has been and we have professionally been through some really really tough times together!</p> 
            <p>He gives me all that I’ve dreamed of since my teens and even though I’ve had relationships before my marriage and flings after I’ve never felt this way. For example I’ve dreamed of having a romantic dinner with the sunset in the background and it’s never happened even though I’ve told my husband. But recently without me even telling this other guy took me for dinner exactly as my imagination! It was perfect. </p> 
            <p>So..: this is my story… please give me any help</p>

            <p>I’ve been married for 6 years. My husband and I have twin daughters and I have a older daughter from a previous relationship. My husband is emotionally abusive and controlling. I was seeing a man who worked under me at my company. He is the epitome of what I’ve desired in a man. Because I’m married he’s distanced himself from me but it makes me want him more. The relationship got physical and I became pregnant but lost the baby. I don’t want to hurt my husband but I’m not happy. What should I do?</p>

            <p>I have been in love with the same man for 15 years. He hasn’t gotten his life together. He is no Prince Charming. He has many flaws but I have came to except even the largest. I have been married 3 years and I love my husband but I can’t love him with my whole heart and I often catch myself holding him up to a standard he can’t achieve because he is not the other man. I don’t want to hurt him, my kids, anyone but I am so unhappy. I feel like this is not where my life is suppose to be. Your post terrified me and confirmed even more my belief that I should just remain unhappy to save others from unhappiness. Please help me.</p>

            <p>Hi. I’m 21 years old female. I married my husband last year a month after my 20th birthday. I did not really want to be married because while I love my husband and we have a lot in common, there’s a lot of things about him that I do not like. A big reason we got married is because of a certain legal benefit. We have no children. My husband is a bit of a narcissist, he’s talked to many girls behind my back including exes. There’s many times he lied about where he was. He’s also very emotionally abusive at times, and has been physically abusive with me. However, when we’re not fighting, I feel like he’s my best friend. But when I look at the bigger picture, there’s too many negatives, and not enough positives in our relationship. I am not planning on having kids with him anytime soon, because of how many times I’ve wanted to just get my stuff and go. I’ve always been very faithful to him, but a few weeks ago, I met this guy who works next to my husband. He befriended my husband online, and then me. We’ve been texting, first as friends, but I’ve noticed myself having a crush on him now. I go out of my way to visit him at his work when I can, and that’s as far as it’s gone, but I’m always thinking about this other guy, and wanting to see him. I feel so guilty for it. I haven’t even hugged him at this point, it’s just been flirting over text and in person. I don’t see myself having a relationship with this other guy, main reason being is that he’s from another country and on a visa here, and also because he plans to move across the country in a month. But I can’t stop thinking about him… I’m not sure what to do. Any advice would help.</p>

            <p>Hi, my name is Dennis and I am deeply confused right now and need someones advise. I am married for 20 years. I love my wife and my children but things didn’t went well with my wife this past few months. The relationship is on the rocks right now to the point that I am getting physically hurt by her when we argue. I don’t hurt back since I am not that type of person and I have respect for women. I hold the grudged and the pain I am feeling right now and keeps it to myself that made me look for someone else. She said she’s on depression stage right now and I am trying to understand that and considering to seek help for her. But it hurts me more taking all that inflicted physical pain on me for understanding her. She wasn’t like that before fyi. But now situation became even worse when I met a woman online whom I opened all my life struggles. We became attached and fell in love with each other even though she knows I am married with kids and was way younger than me. The care, comfort, time and effort she showed/gave me was unremarkable. She’s even the type of woman who doesn’t wan’t to be the main reason of a broken family and I admire her for that. But what can we do we fell in love really quick at the wrong time. After all that love we shared for a couple of months she now realized what she was doing wrong and decided to avoid me now. I know the love we had was sincere and pure. I can even tell how happy she was when she was with me even her friend noticed that too when she confessed to her. I even told her that I can turn my world upside down for her but she refused and instead advised me not to leave my family behind. She’s hurting right now and I am hurting as well to the point that i can’t stop thinking of her even when I am with my family. I can’t focus at work and my daily routine as a normal person. I am completely lost on what to do. I feel bad and disgusted for being unfaithful to my wife but the coldness pushed me away from her. This letting go stage with this other woman is killing both of us. I hope someone can help me on this. Any advice is gladly appreciated. Thank you.</p>
