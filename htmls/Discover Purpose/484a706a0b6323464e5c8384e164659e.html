But the self is not something one finds, it is something one creates. ~Thomas Szasz, "Personal Conduct," <i>The Second Sin</i>, 1973
        <!--pmb--><br> <br> <br> I have sharpened the shares, and harnessed an increased force, for I have determined to plow the furrows deeper, and turn up new layers of life. ~Muriel Strode (1875–1964), <i>My Little Book of Life</i>, 1912
        <!--Qe2, tpviao; sk: middle age, menopause--><br> <br> <br> You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. ~Alan Alda<br> <br> <br> I began by being perplexed about my body; and I ended by being anxious about my soul. In short, I wished to know what I was. ~Adolphe Monod, "Introduction. Letter&nbsp;I: Lucilla to the Abbe Favien," <i>Lucilla; or, The Reading of the Bible</i>, translated from the French by an unnamed translator, 1842
        <!--Qe2, tpvldg, qRRhAAAAcAAJ--><br> <br> <br> Never mind searching for who you are. Search for the person you aspire to be. ~Robert Brault, <a href="http://rbrault.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">rbrault.blogspot.com</a><br> <br> <br> Buried deep beneath the surface of his character, was a hidden, yet a restless ambition: but this was perhaps, at present, a secret even to himself. We know not our own characters till time teaches us self-knowledge... ~Edward George Earle Bulwer-Lytton (1803–1873), <i>Pelham; or, The Adventures of a Gentleman</i>, 1828
        <!--Qe2, tpvldg, 97hEAAAAYAAJ--><br> <br> <br> Man cannot remake himself without suffering, for he is both the marble and the sculptor. ~Dr. Alexis Carrel<br> <br> <br> The greatest explorer on this earth never takes voyages as long as those of the man who descends to the depth of his heart. ~Julien Green
        <!--dfcc--><br> <br> <br> [I]t does not always agree with every one, and I say therefore: try it first and see whether it answers. ~Sebastian Kneipp, <i>Thus Shalt Thou Live: Hints and Advice for the Healthy and the Sick on a Simple and Rational Mode of Life and a Natural Method of Cure</i>, 1889, translated from the 19th German edition
        <!--Qe2; tpvldg, 6LxAAQAAIAAJ, 1894v; sk: paleo cure, customized health plan, wellness--><br> <br> <br> There came a time when the risk to remain tight in the bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom. ~Anaïs Nin<br> <br> <br> The value of identity of course is that so often with it comes purpose. ~Richard Grant<br> <br> <br> You are so young, all still lies ahead of you, and I should like to ask you, as best I can, dear Sir, to be patient towards all that is unresolved in your heart and to try to love <i>the questions themselves</i> like locked rooms, like books written in a foreign tongue. Do not now strive to uncover answers: they cannot be given you because you have not been able to live them. And what matters is to live everything. <i>Live</i> the questions now. Perhaps then you will gradually, without noticing it, live your way into the answer, one distant day in the future. ~Rainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926), 1903 July 16th letter to Franz Xaver Kappus, from Worpswede, translated from German by Charlie Louth
        <!--tpvgb, 2011v; published in Letters to a Young Poet / Briefe an einen jungen Dichter, first published in 1929; alternate translation by Stephen Mitchell: You are so young, so much before all beginning, and I would like to beg you, dear Sir, as well as I can, to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Don't search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.--><br> <br> <br> All men should strive<br> to learn before they die<br> what they are running from, and to, and why.<br> ~James Thurber

       <!--CUL--><br> <br> <br> It is good to feel lost... because it proves you have a navigational sense of where "Home" is. You know that a place that feels like <i>being found</i> exists. And maybe your current location isn't that place but, Hallelujah, that unsettled, uneasy feeling of lost-ness just brought you closer to it. ~Erika Harris, <a href="http://www.empathicwriter.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">empathicwriter.com</a>
       <!--lifeblazing.com/2010/02/16/feeling-lost-lucky-you-->

       <!--pmb--><br> <br> <br> I am... unassembled bits of life. I possess only a fraction of life because I possess only a fraction of myself. One day I shall come in entirety — maybe the entirety will redeem the parts. I shall come in the aggregate of me, and maybe that that has not had seeming relativity will show sequence. ~Muriel Strode (1875–1964), "A Soul's Faring: XXXI," <i>A Soul's Faring</i>, 1921
       <!--Qe2, tpvldgo, EbQyAQAAMAAJ; sk: infj--><br> <br> <br> Man never knows what he wants; he aspires to penetrate mysteries and as soon as he has, he wants to reestablish them. Ignorance irritates him and knowledge cloys. ~Amiel, <i>Journal</i>, 1884
       <!--lcd--><br> <br> <br> Perhaps the truth depends on a walk around the lake. ~Wallace Stevens<br> <br> <br> One may understand the cosmos, but never the ego; the self is more distant than any star. ~G.K. Chesterton, "The Logic of Elfland," <i>Orthodoxy</i>, 1908
       <!--lcd--><br> <br> <br> If you resist reading what you disagree with, how will you ever acquire deeper insights into what you believe? The things most worth reading are precisely those that challenge our convictions. ~Author Unknown<br> <br> <br> It is only when we silent the blaring sounds of our daily existence that we can finally hear the whispers of truth that life reveals to us, as it stands knocking on the doorsteps of our hearts. ~K.T. Jong<br> <br> <br> I met a lot of people in Europe. I even encountered myself. ~James Baldwin<br> <br> <br> There are chapters in every life which are seldom read and certainly not aloud. ~Carol Shields<br> <br> <br> To the question of your life, you are the only answer. To the problems of your life, you are the only solution. ~Jo Coudert, <i>Advice From A Failure</i> (Thanks, Elizabeth!)<br> <br> <br> Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves. ~Henry David Thoreau<br> <br> <br> A single event can awaken within us a stranger totally unknown to us. To live is to be slowly born. ~Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, <i>Flight to Arras</i>, 1942, translated from French<br> <br> <br> In search of my mother's garden, I found my own. ~Alice Walker<br> <br> <br> Why should we honour those that die upon the field of battle? A man may show as reckless a courage in entering into the abyss of himself. ~William Butler Yeats<br> <br> <br> My confusion is but a phase — and I am not afraid of phases. ~Muriel Strode (1875–1964), "Songs of Longing: XXIX," <i>At the Roots of Grasses</i>, 1923
       <!--Qe7, tpvo; sk: infj--><br> <br> <br> If you haven't had at least a slight poetic crack in the heart, you have been cheated by nature. ~Phyllis Battelle<br> <br> <br> Learning how to operate a soul figures to take time. ~Timothy Leary<br> <br> <br> I've left Bethlehem<br> and I feel free...<br> I've left the girl I was supposed to be<br> and some day I'll be born.<br> ~Paula Cole<br> <br> <br> Resolve to be thyself; and know that he who finds himself, loses his misery. ~Matthew Arnold, "Self-Dependence," <i>Empedocles on Etna, and Other Poems</i>, 1852
       <!--, 1l. 31-32-->
       <!--pmb--><br> <br> <br> To dare to live alone is the rarest courage; since there are many who had rather meet their bitterest enemy in the field, than their own hearts in their closet. ~Charles Caleb Colton, <i>Lacon</i>, 1825
       <!--lcd--><br> <br> <br> No one remains quite what he was when he recognizes himself. ~Thomas Mann

       <!-- qtd Words of Life, Charles L. Wallis--><br> <br> <br> There's a period of life when we swallow a knowledge of ourselves and it becomes either good or sour inside. ~Pearl Bailey<br> <br> I can teach anybody how to get what they want out of life. The problem is that I can't find anybody who can tell me what they want. ~Mark Twain<br> <br> <br> He who knows others is learned;<br> He who knows himself is wise.<br> ~Lao-tzu, <i>Tao te Ching</i>
       <!--lcd--><br> <br> <br> 
       <!--At your age, and with your talents, you-->[Y]ou must learn what life is now, not from me, but from life itself; but, if you will hear an old man's opinion, I will give it you. If you think you can temper yourself into manliness by sitting here over your books, supposing you will grow into it as a matter of course by a rule of necessity, in the same way as your body grows old, it is the very silliest fancy that ever tempted a young man into his ruin. You cannot dream yourself into a character; you must hammer and forge yourself one. Go out into life, you will find your chance there, and only there. ~James Anthony Froude, <i>The Nemesis of Faith</i>, 1849, commonly misattributed to Henry David Thoreau
       <!--TPV even the "I will give it you" and not "give it to you" — also thanks walden.org/Library/Quotations/The_Henry_D._Thoreau_Mis-Quotation_Page--><br> <br> <br> Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth. ~Alan Watts
       <!--CUL--><br> <br> <br> Man stands in his own shadow and wonders why it's dark. ~Zen Proverb<br> <br> <br> We are the products of editing, rather than authorship. ~George Wald, "The Origin of Optical Activity," <i>Annals of the New York Academy of Science</i>, 1975
       <!--cd--><br> <br> <br> To be too conscious is an illness — a real thoroughgoing illness. ~Fyodor Dostoyevsky
       <!--cul--><br> <br> <br> You might say that we use ourselves to discover ourselves. ~Judith Hanson Lasater<br> <br> <br> The degree to which a person can grow is directly proportional to the amount of truth he can accept about himself without running away. ~Leland Val Van de Wall<br> <br> <br> Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it. This is a kind of death. ~Anaïs Nin<br> <br> <br> There are... things which a man is afraid to tell even to himself, and every decent man has a number of such things stored away in his mind. ~Fyodor Dostoyevsky, "Notes from the Underground," 1864<br> <br> <br> Man is almost mad—mad because he is seeking something which he has already got; mad because he's not aware of who he is; mad because he hopes, desires and then ultimately, feels frustrated. Frustration is bound to be there because you cannot find yourself by seeking; you are already there. The seeking has to stop, the search has to drop.... ~Osho<br> <br> <br> It's a helluva start, being able to recognize what makes you happy. ~Lucille Ball<br> <br> <br> Find what makes your heart sing and create your own music. ~Mac Anderson<br> <br> <br> Oh! that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves. ~William Shakespeare, "Coriolanus"<br> <br> <br> Know thyself, or at least keep renewing the acquaintance. ~Robert Brault, <a href="http://rbrault.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">rbrault.blogspot.com</a><br> <br> <br> That's not when it started, but it was one of those turning points where yet again the obvious became painfully clear to me. Roads diverge in the wood and I start climbing trees. ~Craig Childs, "About the Author," www.houseofrain.com
       <!--tpvdo, 2014, houseofrain.com/theauthor.cfm--><br> <br> <br> It's terrifying to see someone inside of whom a vital spring seems to have been broken. It's particularly terrifying to see him in your mirror. ~Mignon McLaughlin, <i>The Second Neurotic's Notebook</i>, 1966
       <!--csn, tpv--><br> <br> <br> The thing that is really hard, and really amazing, is giving up on being perfect and beginning the work of becoming yourself. ~Anna Quindlen<br> <br> <br> Men go abroad to wonder at the heights of mountains, at the huge waves of the sea, at the long courses of the rivers, at the vast compass of the ocean, at the circular motions of the stars, and they pass by themselves without wondering. ~St.&nbsp;Augustine<br> <br> <br> I am a soul in process. I am life in the making. I am a weaver with shuttle and thread, and back in my loom the design begins to show. ~Muriel Strode (1875–1964), <i>My Little Book of Life</i>, 1912
       <!--Qe2, tpviao--><br> <br> <br> When you re-read a classic you do not see in the book more than you did before. You see more in you than there was before. ~Clifton Fadiman<br> <br> <br> There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered. ~Nelson Mandela<br> <br> <br> For most men life is a search for the proper manila envelope in which to get themselves filed. ~Clifton Fadiman
       <!--1ww--><br> <br> <br> Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there and what's so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be. ~Douglas Adams, <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i><br> <br> <br> Confusion now hath made his masterpiece. ~William Shakespeare<br> <br> <br> I know by the hunger that eats at my heart that there is a fulfilling answer.... I am come with a craving as deep as worlds.<br> I am a wolf that sits back on its haunches in the night, at the edge of the wilderness, and wails, — a cry for its own that is unanswered.

In such an instance, when the goal is worthy and makes one happy, one should continue on that same life path. Just because the elephant cannot carry you anymore doesn't mean you should give up your goal. Continue down the path that makes you feel fulfilled. Those who continue on an unrewarding path for the sake of only monetary gain are displaying a lack of trust in life. ~Kwan Yin<br> <br> <br> One day I shall come from far seeking with tales of the buried treasure.<br> I look away to the distance and wonder what herbs of healing are growing on the far hills.<br> ~Muriel Strode (1875–1964), "Songs of Longing," <i>At the Roots of Grasses</i>, 1923

Makes you wonder what else you can do that you've forgotten about. ~Alan Ball, <i>American Beauty</i>, 1999<br> <br> <br> Vague desires stir within me which blend together, and give birth to others which afterwards devour them. My desires are a cloud of birds whirling and hovering aimlessly; your desire is an eagle who has his eyes on the sun, and who is prevented by the lack of air from rising on his outstretched wings. Ah! if I could know what I want; if the idea which pursues me would extricate itself clear and precise from the fog that envelops it; if the fortunate or fatal star would appear in the depths of my sky; if the light which I am to follow, whether perfidious will-o'-the-wisp or hospitable beacon, would come and be radiant in the night; if my pillar of fire would go before me, even though it were across a desert without manna and without springs; if I knew whither I am going, though I were only to come to a precipice!—I would rather have the mad riding of accursed huntsmen through quagmires and thickets than this absurd and monotonous movement of the feet. To live in this way is to follow a calling like that of those horses which turn the wheel of some well with bandaged eyes, and travels thousands of leaves without seeing anything for a long time, and the bucket should have quite come up. ~Théophile Gautier, <i>Mademoiselle de Maupin</i>, 1835
