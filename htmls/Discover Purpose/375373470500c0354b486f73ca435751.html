        <title>1 The Hero’s Journey C. Uhl Look at every path closely and deliberately. Try it as many times as you think necessary. Then ask yourself and yourself alone one question. Does this path have a heart? … If it does, then the path is good. If it doesn’t, it is of no use… You can only be real on YOUR path. The hardest thing in the world is to be something you are not. -Leo Buscaglia,1972, pg. 28 Time and again in your BiSci readings I have pointed to the role that social conditioning plays in placing us at odds with ourselves, with each other, and with nature and cosmos. It is no different with matters of the soul. To illustrate: Imagine that you are back in first grade and your teacher smiles at you and asks, “What do you want to be when you get big?” You respond, dreamily, “I want to live in the sea with the whales.” Hearing your response, your teacher says dismissively, “That’s silly; you can’t do that!” Taken aback, sheepishly, you try again with, “I want to live in the forest, high up in trees, with the wind blowing.” Now the expression on your teacher’s face becomes stern and she says, “You will have to get a real job so you can take care of your family.” Fast forward: You are graduating from high school. By this time you have received thousands of messages, both verbal and non-verbal, from parents, teachers, and others in roles of authority restricting and corralling your sense of what is possible. The aggregate message is that you must listen to and heed the voice of those in authority if you are to survive and flourish. This is a message that engenders fear, coaxing you to separate from your soul’s deepest yearnings. The Power of Fear: Emily’s Dilemma In a class discussion Emily says that she has been thinking a lot about dropping out of school but each time she gets close to taking action, she is overwhelmed with fear. “What’s the worst of this fear?” I ask her. “The worst,” she replies with a shy laugh, “is that I will be left homeless on the street.” Emily has a belief, and accompanying fear, that without a college education her life will be a shambles. The tragedy in Emily’s case, and there are millions of young people like Emily, is that she is sacrificing her life—her fulfillment in the present moment—her freedom—because of her fear. Indeed, through the process of her schooling, Emily has been conditioned to ignore the present, conditioned to sacrifice the present for the future. This is a way of being which is anti-life because it ignores the very place where life occurs—right now! Unless, Emily breaks free of her conditioning, she will, likely, live her entire life in fear, oblivious to the present—always preparing for a future which never arrives because the “future,” in reality doesn’t exist, it is a concept that lives only in the mind. Indeed, Emily, no different from the rest of us, has been socially conditioned to accept as true a set of beliefs that are profoundly life-denying. Here is a sampling: –Humans are greedy and competitive by nature. Underlying message: Look out for Number One! 2 –Only things that can be measured are real. Underlying message: Be realistic; there is no room in this world for your soul/sprit/heart –When you encounter problems in life, go to an expert. Underlying message: You are not competent. –Things are the way they are and you need to accept this. Underlying message: You are powerless to affect change. –If you are upset or depressed, the problem’s with you! Hidden message: Hide your feelings; keep on a smiley face; lie and join everyone else in the game of “let’s pretend.” These beliefs (and others like them) are not inherently true; they are simply cultural constructs that engender fear, while at the same time stifling creativity and crippling the imagination. But, consider: What if Emily were to live in a less fearful culture—one that encouraged her to believe that her desire to leave school was, quite possibly, her soul guiding her toward a unique calling? And what if her teachers in this more enlightened culture, rather than feeding her fear, were to invite her shy soul-voice into the open, helping her take a step toward discerning her life path. When young people, like Emily, are seduced by the siren songs of limiting beliefs, they lose the awareness, attention and courage necessary to find their unique soul print. The result is that they risk becoming “nice dead people” leading shallow lives that are not their own. This situation is reflected in the story about the man who found an egg of a wild bird and placed it in the nest of a barnyard hen. Eventually the egg hatched and out came an eagle. The eaglet, reared in the barnyard with a brood of chicks, followed their example scratching the earth for worms and insects; he clucked and cackled like they did, and, like them, he would thrash his wings and lift himself a few feet off the ground before plopping back to the ground. Then, one day when the eagle was several years old, he was awestruck by a magnificent golden-winged bird he saw flying high in the sky and he asked a nearby chicken “Who is that?” The chicken responded, “That’s the eagle, the king of birds; he is different from us; he belongs to the sky. We, on the other hand, are chickens; we belong to the ground. The barnyard eagle continued to live as a chicken until the day he died. Why? Because that is what he believed he was! Might it be that it is no different for us—that our culture, including our education system, has conditioned us to see ourselves as economic animals, meant to spend our lives as producers with our heads to the grindstone; when, in fact, we are eagles—i.e., magnificent beings capable of things beyond our wildest imaginings? Because of social conditioning many people who attend college end up majoring in “upward mobility”—a sure path to a life as “chicken.” Sadly, they have been brainwashed into believing that a “successful” life is one benchmarked by a good salary, ample material possessions and a good retirement plan. David Orr challenges this narrow view of success, positing that what really matters in life is not a good paying job but the capacity to discover and then follow one’s calling: “The plain fact is that the planet does not need more ‘successful’ people,” writes Orr, “but it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind. It needs people who live well in their places. It needs people of moral courage willing to join the fight to make the world habitable and humane. And these qualities have little to do with ‘success’ as our culture has defined it” (1994; pg. 12). 3 Leave Your Parents at the Door Storyteller Ron Jones relates a story about his father, who was a musician at heart but who worked for 35 years selling televisions, refrigerators, and glassware in a department store in San Francisco. One day Ray’s father was told that the store was closing. In those days there were no golden parachutes or retirement benefits, and when they asked if there was anything they could do for him, his only request was to have the chair he’d been sitting in all those years. They sold it to him. “He brought that chair to my house on his back one day,” says Ron, “and placed it in my living room and told me about all the years he had sat in it, and then he made me promise that I would never sit down in that chair, ever. It’s in my living room to this day, and I never sit in it. I just tell the story, and the lesson my father passed on to me through it: Don’t sit down in life. All through your life you’re going to be asked to sit down, to conform, comply, and compromise, and it can be very deadly if you get in the habit of doing that. Be leery of the price of conformity, my father told me. Stand up, create things, do things” (Levoy, 1997, pg. 206). The search for one’s genuine and unique calling is arduous for today’s young people, especially since many parents (unlike Ron’s Father) fail to fully honor and support this search. With this in mind, I often tell my students: “Please leave your parents at the door.” In effect, I am saying, “Chances are you have been told what to do—told how to live—for the last 18 years. Now you are here in college, on your own for the first time and this is your life—not your parent’s life that is unfolding before you. Your parent’s primary job is to live their life; your job is to live your life.” Your Parents Job is to Live THEIR Life: In his book, It’s a Meaningful Life, Bo Lozoff uses a Hasidic story retold by Rabbi Abraham Twerski to examine the consequences when parents sacrifice their lives for their children. The story begins with a Rabbi asking a man, who is engaged day-after-day in his business ventures, when he might have time to devote to prayer and the study of the Torah. The man responds that his life is simple and his needs are few and that he sincerely wants to devote time to prayer but he is not able to because he is obligated to provide and save money for his child’s future. Well, years go by and that child becomes a grown man and he, too, becomes fully engrossed in business. The Rabbi, now in middle age, asks the young man when he might have time to pray and study the Tora? But, like his father before him, the son responds that, though his needs are few, he has to work long hours to provide for his family and his child’s future. In time the son’s child grows up and the story is the same…. And, so it comes to pass that this same excuse is repeated generation after generation—no man having time to live life according to his beliefs because each in turn feels he must provide for ‘his’ child…. “Somewhere then,” the Rabbi exclaims, “perhaps at the end of time, we will find that ultimate child for whose welfare countless generations have so toiled that they’ve neglected their own values in the process. Where, where is that ultimate child? Is he not but a fiction. A non-existent end-point? An illusion that has driven the entire world into an insane striving toward futility?” (2000, pgs. 144-5). The moral of this story, as I see it, is that our children have the very same needs as we do and those needs have to do with living lives of meaning and joy and, as is all too obvious, 4 affluence in no way correlates to genuine happiness, much less success. “The way for a parent to give his child the maximum chance for a joyful and meaningful life is to be living such a life him/herself in their very presence, not sacrificing their life for their child” (2000, pg. 145). If it is our calling to work with the poor, or to farm or to compose music, or to build furniture (even if this means that we live below the “poverty line”), this way of being is our gift to our children and the world. Note: This is not to say that the parent does not care for her child, nurture her child—of course she does!—but not at the expense of failing to live her unique calling in life. Your Job is to Live YOUR Life: One of the hardest things for young people to learn is that it is their job to live their very own unique life. Indeed, when a young person takes a stand for his/her life, he/she is helping her parents do the same! For example, imagine a case where a Dad doesn’t think his son is going to be successful in life because his son hasn’t chosen a major that he approves of. The Dad is upset—he is suffering—because his son actions are not conforming to his desires. The son isn’t making his Dad suffer—he is not causing the Dad’s suffering. Indeed, the Dad could end his suffering by simply choosing to believe that the perfect major for his son is the one that his son is most passionate about. Tragically, the Dad’s fear that “My son will not be successful” plays out in such a way that the father is not successful in maintaining a close loving relationship with his son. In other words, “My son will not be successful” translates in life to “I am not successful right now at loving my son.” (Note: This is a “turnaround” ala Byron Katie.) If the Dad could muster the courage to look deeply into this, he is likely to discover that at the core of his suffering is his need to have his son emulate him—i.e., part of the Dad’s identity is wrapped up in needing his son’s approval—and when his son takes another path this is upsetting for the Dad. Rather than having his son’s approval, this Dad needs his own approval…. Which is to say that the Dad needs to love his own life, irrespective of his son’s actions, thereby giving his son the freedom to live and love his particular life. The son for his part has the same challenge—i.e., to love his own life, irrespective of the disapproval, real or imagined, he may sense from his Dad. The work for the son is to not get caught up in his Dad’s fear that he is not going to be successful by simply recognizing the ways in which he is successful—this means defining success on his terms, not his Dad’s terms. Whether it is a parent or a child, what keeps a person from living their lives authentically is fear. In this vein, Martha Beck (2001) makes a useful distinction between what she calls the “social self” and the “essential self.” The “social self” is your surface self that seeks to keep you in line by ensuring that you conform to societal norms; whereas your “essential self” is akin to your soul—that sense of “isness” that resides at the core of your being. These two “selves” are often in opposition to one another. So, when a desire for bold action arises from one’s essential self, it is likely to be shouted down by the social self for fear of what others will think. For example, you think to yourself: If I quit my job to become an artist, or if I leave my church because I am seeking a different form of spiritual nurturance, or if I take a strong stand on a controversial issue, “everybody” will either lose respect for me or think I’m nuts. A funny thing happens, though, when one takes the time to consider who their “everybody” is? Invariable each of our “everybodies” is composed of just a handful of people, though we act as if it is the world at large. What’s more your “everybody” is different from the “everybody” of the person next to you and so on down the line. As it turns out, whenever an action is inspired by a calling from the “essential self,” however bold it might be, there will be 5 many who will applaud it and many others who will take no note, and just a tiny handful (your “everybody”) who might be upset. Tom’s Story To illustrate what it might mean to fearlessly live one’s own life, consider the story of Tom, a college student, who was severely depressed, a situation common among college students these days. As Tom gradually lost interest in his studies, he reached a point when he could barely get himself up in the morning to go to classes. Tom: I decided I really did not care if I lived or died. As far as I could tell, it was simply the momentum and inertia of my family’s expectations that had brought me this far. Being a student was not my life. It was a wish or demand that others had for me. I felt trapped. Then, one summer day Tom took a potentially lethal amount of drugs and alcohol. He teetered on the edge of death, knowing that he could simply let go and die, but Tom chose to live. Tom: What astonished me then was that there was something to actually hold on to, a something that was almost tangible. I realized in that moment that there was an essence of me beyond the compilation of my nerves and tissue. There was a me I could hold on to. I could feel my will, my self, my soul. It was as if I was experiencing the essential force at the center of life itself. I knew holding on would be tough—I had taken a lot of drugs and could feel how badly I had abused my body. But I knew I had to hold on. No sooner had Tom come to when he received a phone call informing him that a close childhood friend had been killed in a terrible accident. Tom was first devastated and, then, appalled when he acknowledged that, just hours before, he had tried to end his own precious life. When classes began a few weeks later, Tom returned to school, but one September morning when he left his apartment, rather than turning right toward school, he turned left, making his way to a lake. There he sat and sat gazing out over the water to the mountains off to the west. Tom: I fell into a trance. I became keenly aware of the beauty—the reflection of the mountains in the calm, glassy water; the birds circling and calling; the dramatic gray clouds. I noticed that in one spot the sun was shining through a blue hole. Rays of splintered sunlight struck the high peaks across the lake. I had a sense of being beckoned by that hole. I knew without a doubt I was being called to go through that hole and over the mountains. So it was that a few days later Tom headed West first to Colorado, then roaming with the Grateful Dead for a time, then journeying to Africa…. Eventually he returned to college but this time with clarity of purpose and vision for his life. Tom had, in effect, left his cultural conditioning behind and made the descent into the soul, the seat of purpose, meaning, and passion. This is a life and death journey. When we fail to make it we die to ourselves. When we choose to make the journey, we also have to face our death—the death that occurs as we leave our old ways of being—i.e., our old social roles; our old ways of relating to ourselves and others; our old fears that crimped us; our old ways of loving bounded by conditions—behind. 6 Initially Tom “stuck it out” in school in deference to his parents. This created feelings of tension and division—feelings that arise when one is at war with himself. Tom’s every day self or state of consciousness (i.e., his ego) was at war with his essential self. Tom’s ego wanted to preserve the status quo; it wanted to avoid things that might lead to social censorship. As such the ego is distinct from soul and spirit. Indeed, the ego emerges, not from nature, but from the matrix of culture. In Tom’s case, it was the act of coming into relationship with his soul—his essence—that enabled his “adolescent ego”—conditioned to depend on social acceptance—to die, making way for his healthy “adult ego” which acts in concert with soul to create a life grounded in one’s unique calling (Plotkin, 2003; quotes from pages 62-63). From Vision to Action: Living One’s Calling at PSU Most of us go to our graves with our music still inside us. -Oliver Wendell Homes One of the things I love about teaching is that I sometimes get to witness those first moments of awakening when students begin to take their life into their own hands. Here are four stories gleaned from my experiences. Sue’s Story: Sue was a second semester senior when she came into my office for the first time. She was taking my Environmental Science course and this was raising grave doubts about her major. She told me, in effect: “I don’t know what to do? I have this degree in advertising but now I have come to see that advertising simply encourages people to consume more and more stuff and all this consumption is destroying everything—our water, our soil, our air.” I like my major but I want to make a positive difference in the world, not contribute to more problems. I am so lost…. As I listened, it occurred to me that Sue was suffering from the disabling belief that there was only one way she could apply her advertising/marketing skills. As we talked, I saw that what she really wanted was to be a part of an organization that was protecting the environment, like The Sierra Club or Greenpeace. I asked her if these organizations might benefit by having someone with her skills—e.g., someone who could help them deliver their “messages” with more cogency and power or someone who could help them mount more effective fund-raising campaigns? Suddenly a way opened for her. Ronak’s Story: Ronak was a Hotel and Restaurant Management major. Like Sue, he had taken my environmental science course and thought that I might extend a sympathetic ear to him. As I listened, I learned that Ronak had selected his major on pragmatic grounds—e.g., lots of job opportunities. Now, on the eve of his graduation from Penn State he had discovered that his heart’s deepest yearning was to be part of a spiritual community. And, suddenly, the idea of working as a Junior Manager for big hotel in Miami Beach no longer inspired him. I watched as his demeanor shifted from despair to acute curiosity when I informed him that there are hundreds upon hundreds of spiritual retreat centers located throughout the U.S. and that these centers are continually hosting guests who come for workshops and retreats. “How is it that these centers manage to host (house 7 and feed) all their visitors?” I asked. Ronak got it, of course. They need people with exactly the set of skills he had acquired in his major. Dennis’ Story: Dennis received his degree in Golf Course Management. In the course of his studies, he, too, took my environmental science course and learned to his surprise that heavy fertilizer, pesticide and water use, associated with golf courses, can pollute groundwater and deplete aquifers. Though Dennis was excited about managing a golf course, he was troubled that, through his work, he might be causing harm to the environment. Hearing his concern, I told him about the efforts that some progressive golf course managers were making to eliminate the use of pesticides and to landscape their courses in ways that dramatically reduce the need for watering while creating habitat beneficial to wildlife. Suddenly, Dennis saw how, through his work, he might be part of a solution, rather than part of a problem. Jean’s Story: Then there is Jean, a Biology major, who I met during the second semester of her senior year when she took my Field Ecology course. During the semester I watched as Jean became more and more open to expressing her doubts about the rightness of her major. But then, as graduation time approached, Jean decided to go to graduate school in Biology, reasoning that this would be the most prudent thing to do since she had already spent four years majoring in Biology. Jean’s grades were good and her GRE scores were solid so I assumed that she would be accepted to graduate school. However, she was rejected by all seven of the graduate programs she applied to. Though Jean was temporarily stunned by this set back, I encouraged her to see it as an invitation to find her true calling. In an email she sent me shortly after graduation she wrote: “I had my future planned out and now I’m being forced to rethink, well, everything. I won’t lie though, it is probably for the better seeing how my interests have been evolving… But I’m pretty overwhelmed about what to do in the immediate future and really don’t even know where to start. I’m just treading water until I find some clarity.” A year letter I received a handwritten letter from her wherein she informed me that she had moved to Maine. Among other things she wrote: “I have fallen in love with this place.” And of her job at Maine’s Ferry Beach Ecology School: “The days are 14 hours long and I make little money but I have a room overlooking the ocean and when the waves crash my bed sometimes shakes. I have met amazing people who work for the love of it and spend all their time in the moment with little regard for any long-term plan. And it freaks me out but slowly all the pressure I have been putting on myself to figure out my future is melting away and for once I am totally happy.” She concludes: “What happens after this is uncertain but the current moment is a wonderful gift. I am having so much fun….” Not all young folks are as courageous as Sue, Ronak, Dennis, and Jean. I see these four as soul heroes. In this vein, Parker Palmer (1998) believes that the act of committing to one’s soul’s calling is, in effect, deciding to “live divided no more.” In other words, the soul hero refuses to live on the outside in ways that contradict the truths that are part of his/her essence. In so doing soul heroes serve as beacons for others, manifesting lives of integrity. Palmer calls the decision “to live divided no more” the “Rosa Parks Decision” for it was Rosa Parks, a black woman living in Alabama, who decided that she would not 8 pretend to accept on the outside what she knew, in her heart, to be fundamentally wrong. So by taking a seat in the front of the bus (instead of in the designated zone in the back) Parks stood up with her whole undivided being. We, just as Parks, become fearless when we realize that there is no punishment—not public criticism, not jail, not physical beating—that could come close to equaling the punishment we do to ourselves when we collude in our own diminishment by separating from our soul’s deep calling. Bringing Your Calling Fully to Life The biggest obstacle deterring young people from following their calling is “social conditioning.” For example, imagine that you are 17 and you know in the depths of your being that your calling is to be a musician. You have no doubt: It is music more than anything else that makes your heart sing! But still you hesitate, immobilized by all those voices in your head saying things like: “You can’t be a musician.” “Who do you think you are?” “You are not good enough.” “Be practical.” Do you want to end up on the street playing the harmonica with a tin cup in front of you?” These are not the voices emanating from your fearless soul. Rather, they are voices implanted into your psyche by a culture that fails to honor and nurture your soul’s deepest yearnings. As such, these voices are designed to engender fear and thereby keep you in line so that you don’t rock the proverbial boat. Tragically, the young person who succumbs to these voices remains asleep to the magnificence of what it means to be born human. It is possible to break free of the constraints, both imagined and real, imposed by culture. And, fortunately, now at the rise of the third millennium, there are new cultural voices arising, voices that offer a profoundly empowering understanding of human purpose and potential. These new voices are grounded: not in separation but in relationship; not in limitation but in possibility; not in control but in freedom; not in fear but in love. As such, these new voices cultivate, not soul cowards but, soul heroes. Central to these new more empowering voices is the understanding that we human beings are not separate, but intimately connected to each other and to everything else in the Universe. Indeed, modern physics reveals that each of us is, most essentially, a packet of pulsating energy situated in a vast sea of potentiality. Yes, we are constantly interacting, energetically, with everything in the Universe, both near and far, whether we know it or not. This means, in effect, that things have no meaning in isolation; they are only understandable in the context of a web of dynamic interrelationships. As McTaggart (2007; pg. xix, xx)) puts it, “The universe [is] not a storehouse of static, separate objects, but a single organism of interconnected energy fields in a continuous state of becoming. At its infinitesimal level, our world resembles a vast network of quantum information, with all its component parts constantly on the phone.” We Are an Energy Field Within an Energy Field Most people define themselves [as a finite physical] body, but you’re not a finite body. Even under a microscope you’re an energy field. What we know about energy is this: You go to quantum physicist and you say, “What creates the world?” And he or she will say, “Energy.” Well, describe energy… “OK, it can never be created or 9 destroyed; it always was, and always has been; everything that ever existed always exist; it’s moving into form, though form and out of form.” You go to a theologian and ask the question, “What created the Universe?” And she will say, “God.” OK describe God. “Always was and always has been; never can be created or destroyed; all that ever was, always will be; always moving into form, though form and out of form.” You see, it’s the same description, just differently terminology. So if you think you’re this “meat suit” running around, think again. You’re a spiritual being! You’re an energy field, operating in a larger energy field (James Ray in Byrne, 2007; pgs 158-159). Einstein in his prescience expressed it this way: “A human being is part of the whole, called by us “universe”… He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest—a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.” Since each of us is, most essentially, energy, it should not surprise you to learn that your thoughts are energy. Indeed, your thought “energy” takes the form of light—not the kind of “light” that is detectable by the human eye, but bona fide light that can be measured as photons by sensitive equipment. Metaphorically speaking, we are each like stars—balls of energy generating, by virtue of our thoughts, a steady stream of glowing photons that pass from us out into the universe, affecting everything in their path. The implications of these findings have great relevance for the young person setting out to pursue his/her unique calling. Why? Because they reveal that each of us has the potential to determine our destiny with our thoughts and intentions. Indeed, it appears the Buddha had it right 2500 years ago when he said, “All that we are is a result of what we have thought.” In other words, to a significant extent, you have the life you have now because of your past thoughts. It is those largely those thoughts that have “materialized” your life. Think of it this way. Your thoughts are energy and all energy vibrates at a frequency. This means that the frequency of energy you broadcast out to the universe differs depending on what you are thinking. Meanwhile, the constellation of elements that comprise your calling also vibrates at a frequency. Enter The Law of Attraction—the basic law of the Universe which says that like attracts like. Energetically speaking this means that the frequency of your thought energy has a way of attracting and bringing back to you things which are energetically compatible or so the theory goes. To the extent that this is true it means that each of us, in effect, thinks and speaks our life into existence (Byrne, 2006). CONCLUSION The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you. Don’t go back to sleep. You must ask for what you really want. Don’t go back to sleep. People are going back and forth across the doorsill where the two worlds touch. The door is round and open. Don’t go back to sleep. -Jelaluddin Rumi 10 Never before in the history of humankind has a culture said to its young (as we now do): “It’s a dog-eat-dog world out there. Study hard so that you can get ahead of those around you. The goal of life is to accumulate money and the things money can buy; this will bring you happiness.” This is a alienating and soulless message for we all know, deep down, that life is not primarily about greedily taking care of one’s self. There is no genuine fulfillment, no life, in that. We are not here on Earth, primarily, to make money. Rather each of us is a unique part of the human family. Now it is our turn to ensure that the human story continues and deepens. In this context the question for all of us is not how are we going to make a killing in the money market, but how are we going create the conditions wherein our grandchildren and their children, and “all our relations”—i.e., the winged ones and the four-leggeds—can flourish on this planet we have been graced to visit for a short time? This is a question that calls forth our bigness and fullness of being. It is a question that we can only by answered by “hushing” and listening to our souls. References Beck, M. 2001.

The hardest thing in the world is to be something you are not. -Leo Buscaglia,1972, pg. 28 Time and again in your BiSci readings I have pointed to the role that social conditioning plays in placing us at odds with ourselves, with each other, and with nature and cosmos. It is no different with matters of the soul. To illustrate: Imagine that you are back in first grade and your teacher smiles at you and asks, “What do you want to be when you get big?” You respond, dreamily, “I want to live in the sea with the whales.” Hearing your response, your teacher says dismissively, “That’s silly; you can’t do that!” Taken aback, sheepishly, you try again with, “I want to live in the forest, high up in trees, with the wind blowing.” Now the expression on your teacher’s face becomes stern and she says, “You will have to get a real job so you can take care of your family.” Fast forward: You are graduating from high school. By this time you have received thousands of messages, both verbal and non-verbal, from parents, teachers, and others in roles of authority restricting and corralling your sense of what is possible. The aggregate message is that you must listen to and heed the voice of those in authority if you are to survive and flourish. This is a message that engenders fear, coaxing you to separate from your soul’s deepest yearnings. The Power of Fear: Emily’s Dilemma In a class discussion Emily says that she has been thinking a lot about dropping out of school but each time she gets close to taking action, she is overwhelmed with fear. “What’s the worst of this fear?” I ask her. “The worst,” she replies with a shy laugh, “is that I will be left homeless on the street.” Emily has a belief, and accompanying fear, that without a college education her life will be a shambles. The tragedy in Emily’s case, and there are millions of young people like Emily, is that she is sacrificing her life—her fulfillment in the present moment—her freedom—because of her fear. Indeed, through the process of her schooling, Emily has been conditioned to ignore the present, conditioned to sacrifice the present for the future. This is a way of being which is anti-life because it ignores the very place where life occurs—right now! Unless, Emily breaks free of her conditioning, she will, likely, live her entire life in fear, oblivious to the present—always preparing for a future which never arrives because the “future,” in reality doesn’t exist, it is a concept that lives only in the mind. Indeed, Emily, no different from the rest of us, has been socially conditioned to accept as true a set of beliefs that are profoundly life-denying. Here is a sampling: –Humans are greedy and competitive by nature. Underlying message: Look out for Number One! 2 –Only things that can be measured are real. Underlying message: Be realistic; there is no room in this world for your soul/sprit/heart –When you encounter problems in life, go to an expert. Underlying message: You are not competent. –Things are the way they are and you need to accept this. Underlying message: You are powerless to affect change. –If you are upset or depressed, the problem’s with you! Hidden message: Hide your feelings; keep on a smiley face; lie and join everyone else in the game of “let’s pretend.” These beliefs (and others like them) are not inherently true; they are simply cultural constructs that engender fear, while at the same time stifling creativity and crippling the imagination. But, consider: What if Emily were to live in a less fearful culture—one that encouraged her to believe that her desire to leave school was, quite possibly, her soul guiding her toward a unique calling? And what if her teachers in this more enlightened culture, rather than feeding her fear, were to invite her shy soul-voice into the open, helping her take a step toward discerning her life path. When young people, like Emily, are seduced by the siren songs of limiting beliefs, they lose the awareness, attention and courage necessary to find their unique soul print. The result is that they risk becoming “nice dead people” leading shallow lives that are not their own. This situation is reflected in the story about the man who found an egg of a wild bird and placed it in the nest of a barnyard hen. Eventually the egg hatched and out came an eagle. The eaglet, reared in the barnyard with a brood of chicks, followed their example scratching the earth for worms and insects; he clucked and cackled like they did, and, like them, he would thrash his wings and lift himself a few feet off the ground before plopping back to the ground. Then, one day when the eagle was several years old, he was awestruck by a magnificent golden-winged bird he saw flying high in the sky and he asked a nearby chicken “Who is that?” The chicken responded, “That’s the eagle, the king of birds; he is different from us; he belongs to the sky. We, on the other hand, are chickens; we belong to the ground. The barnyard eagle continued to live as a chicken until the day he died. Why? Because that is what he believed he was! Might it be that it is no different for us—that our culture, including our education system, has conditioned us to see ourselves as economic animals, meant to spend our lives as producers with our heads to the grindstone; when, in fact, we are eagles—i.e., magnificent beings capable of things beyond our wildest imaginings? Because of social conditioning many people who attend college end up majoring in “upward mobility”—a sure path to a life as “chicken.” Sadly, they have been brainwashed into believing that a “successful” life is one benchmarked by a good salary, ample material possessions and a good retirement plan. David Orr challenges this narrow view of success, positing that what really matters in life is not a good paying job but the capacity to discover and then follow one’s calling: “The plain fact is that the planet does not need more ‘successful’ people,” writes Orr, “but it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind. It needs people who live well in their places. It needs people of moral courage willing to join the fight to make the world habitable and humane. And these qualities have little to do with ‘success’ as our culture has defined it” (1994; pg. 12). 3 Leave Your Parents at the Door Storyteller Ron Jones relates a story about his father, who was a musician at heart but who worked for 35 years selling televisions, refrigerators, and glassware in a department store in San Francisco. One day Ray’s father was told that the store was closing. In those days there were no golden parachutes or retirement benefits, and when they asked if there was anything they could do for him, his only request was to have the chair he’d been sitting in all those years. They sold it to him. “He brought that chair to my house on his back one day,” says Ron, “and placed it in my living room and told me about all the years he had sat in it, and then he made me promise that I would never sit down in that chair, ever. It’s in my living room to this day, and I never sit in it. I just tell the story, and the lesson my father passed on to me through it: Don’t sit down in life. All through your life you’re going to be asked to sit down, to conform, comply, and compromise, and it can be very deadly if you get in the habit of doing that. Be leery of the price of conformity, my father told me. Stand up, create things, do things” (Levoy, 1997, pg. 206). The search for one’s genuine and unique calling is arduous for today’s young people, especially since many parents (unlike Ron’s Father) fail to fully honor and support this search. With this in mind, I often tell my students: “Please leave your parents at the door.” In effect, I am saying, “Chances are you have been told what to do—told how to live—for the last 18 years. Now you are here in college, on your own for the first time and this is your life—not your parent’s life that is unfolding before you. Your parent’s primary job is to live their life; your job is to live your life.” Your Parents Job is to Live THEIR Life: In his book, It’s a Meaningful Life, Bo Lozoff uses a Hasidic story retold by Rabbi Abraham Twerski to examine the consequences when parents sacrifice their lives for their children. The story begins with a Rabbi asking a man, who is engaged day-after-day in his business ventures, when he might have time to devote to prayer and the study of the Torah. The man responds that his life is simple and his needs are few and that he sincerely wants to devote time to prayer but he is not able to because he is obligated to provide and save money for his child’s future. Well, years go by and that child becomes a grown man and he, too, becomes fully engrossed in business. The Rabbi, now in middle age, asks the young man when he might have time to pray and study the Tora? But, like his father before him, the son responds that, though his needs are few, he has to work long hours to provide for his family and his child’s future. In time the son’s child grows up and the story is the same…. And, so it comes to pass that this same excuse is repeated generation after generation—no man having time to live life according to his beliefs because each in turn feels he must provide for ‘his’ child…. “Somewhere then,” the Rabbi exclaims, “perhaps at the end of time, we will find that ultimate child for whose welfare countless generations have so toiled that they’ve neglected their own values in the process. Where, where is that ultimate child? Is he not but a fiction. A non-existent end-point? An illusion that has driven the entire world into an insane striving toward futility?” (2000, pgs. 144-5). The moral of this story, as I see it, is that our children have the very same needs as we do and those needs have to do with living lives of meaning and joy and, as is all too obvious, 4 affluence in no way correlates to genuine happiness, much less success. “The way for a parent to give his child the maximum chance for a joyful and meaningful life is to be living such a life him/herself in their very presence, not sacrificing their life for their child” (2000, pg. 145). If it is our calling to work with the poor, or to farm or to compose music, or to build furniture (even if this means that we live below the “poverty line”), this way of being is our gift to our children and the world. Note: This is not to say that the parent does not care for her child, nurture her child—of course she does!—but not at the expense of failing to live her unique calling in life. Your Job is to Live YOUR Life: One of the hardest things for young people to learn is that it is their job to live their very own unique life. Indeed, when a young person takes a stand for his/her life, he/she is helping her parents do the same! For example, imagine a case where a Dad doesn’t think his son is going to be successful in life because his son hasn’t chosen a major that he approves of. The Dad is upset—he is suffering—because his son actions are not conforming to his desires. The son isn’t making his Dad suffer—he is not causing the Dad’s suffering. Indeed, the Dad could end his suffering by simply choosing to believe that the perfect major for his son is the one that his son is most passionate about. Tragically, the Dad’s fear that “My son will not be successful” plays out in such a way that the father is not successful in maintaining a close loving relationship with his son. In other words, “My son will not be successful” translates in life to “I am not successful right now at loving my son.” (Note: This is a “turnaround” ala Byron Katie.) If the Dad could muster the courage to look deeply into this, he is likely to discover that at the core of his suffering is his need to have his son emulate him—i.e., part of the Dad’s identity is wrapped up in needing his son’s approval—and when his son takes another path this is upsetting for the Dad. Rather than having his son’s approval, this Dad needs his own approval…. Which is to say that the Dad needs to love his own life, irrespective of his son’s actions, thereby giving his son the freedom to live and love his particular life. The son for his part has the same challenge—i.e., to love his own life, irrespective of the disapproval, real or imagined, he may sense from his Dad. The work for the son is to not get caught up in his Dad’s fear that he is not going to be successful by simply recognizing the ways in which he is successful—this means defining success on his terms, not his Dad’s terms. Whether it is a parent or a child, what keeps a person from living their lives authentically is fear. In this vein, Martha Beck (2001) makes a useful distinction between what she calls the “social self” and the “essential self.” The “social self” is your surface self that seeks to keep you in line by ensuring that you conform to societal norms; whereas your “essential self” is akin to your soul—that sense of “isness” that resides at the core of your being. These two “selves” are often in opposition to one another. So, when a desire for bold action arises from one’s essential self, it is likely to be shouted down by the social self for fear of what others will think. For example, you think to yourself: If I quit my job to become an artist, or if I leave my church because I am seeking a different form of spiritual nurturance, or if I take a strong stand on a controversial issue, “everybody” will either lose respect for me or think I’m nuts. A funny thing happens, though, when one takes the time to consider who their “everybody” is? Invariable each of our “everybodies” is composed of just a handful of people, though we act as if it is the world at large. What’s more your “everybody” is different from the “everybody” of the person next to you and so on down the line. As it turns out, whenever an action is inspired by a calling from the “essential self,” however bold it might be, there will be 5 many who will applaud it and many others who will take no note, and just a tiny handful (your “everybody”) who might be upset. Tom’s Story To illustrate what it might mean to fearlessly live one’s own life, consider the story of Tom, a college student, who was severely depressed, a situation common among college students these days. As Tom gradually lost interest in his studies, he reached a point when he could barely get himself up in the morning to go to classes. Tom: I decided I really did not care if I lived or died. As far as I could tell, it was simply the momentum and inertia of my family’s expectations that had brought me this far. Being a student was not my life. It was a wish or demand that others had for me. I felt trapped. Then, one summer day Tom took a potentially lethal amount of drugs and alcohol. He teetered on the edge of death, knowing that he could simply let go and die, but Tom chose to live. Tom: What astonished me then was that there was something to actually hold on to, a something that was almost tangible. I realized in that moment that there was an essence of me beyond the compilation of my nerves and tissue. There was a me I could hold on to. I could feel my will, my self, my soul. It was as if I was experiencing the essential force at the center of life itself. I knew holding on would be tough—I had taken a lot of drugs and could feel how badly I had abused my body. But I knew I had to hold on. No sooner had Tom come to when he received a phone call informing him that a close childhood friend had been killed in a terrible accident. Tom was first devastated and, then, appalled when he acknowledged that, just hours before, he had tried to end his own precious life. When classes began a few weeks later, Tom returned to school, but one September morning when he left his apartment, rather than turning right toward school, he turned left, making his way to a lake. There he sat and sat gazing out over the water to the mountains off to the west. Tom: I fell into a trance. I became keenly aware of the beauty—the reflection of the mountains in the calm, glassy water; the birds circling and calling; the dramatic gray clouds. I noticed that in one spot the sun was shining through a blue hole. Rays of splintered sunlight struck the high peaks across the lake. I had a sense of being beckoned by that hole. I knew without a doubt I was being called to go through that hole and over the mountains. So it was that a few days later Tom headed West first to Colorado, then roaming with the Grateful Dead for a time, then journeying to Africa…. Eventually he returned to college but this time with clarity of purpose and vision for his life. Tom had, in effect, left his cultural conditioning behind and made the descent into the soul, the seat of purpose, meaning, and passion. This is a life and death journey. When we fail to make it we die to ourselves. When we choose to make the journey, we also have to face our death—the death that occurs as we leave our old ways of being—i.e., our old social roles; our old ways of relating to ourselves and others; our old fears that crimped us; our old ways of loving bounded by conditions—behind. 6 Initially Tom “stuck it out” in school in deference to his parents. This created feelings of tension and division—feelings that arise when one is at war with himself. Tom’s every day self or state of consciousness (i.e., his ego) was at war with his essential self. Tom’s ego wanted to preserve the status quo; it wanted to avoid things that might lead to social censorship. As such the ego is distinct from soul and spirit. Indeed, the ego emerges, not from nature, but from the matrix of culture. In Tom’s case, it was the act of coming into relationship with his soul—his essence—that enabled his “adolescent ego”—conditioned to depend on social acceptance—to die, making way for his healthy “adult ego” which acts in concert with soul to create a life grounded in one’s unique calling (Plotkin, 2003; quotes from pages 62-63). From Vision to Action: Living One’s Calling at PSU Most of us go to our graves with our music still inside us. -Oliver Wendell Homes One of the things I love about teaching is that I sometimes get to witness those first moments of awakening when students begin to take their life into their own hands. Here are four stories gleaned from my experiences. Sue’s Story: Sue was a second semester senior when she came into my office for the first time. She was taking my Environmental Science course and this was raising grave doubts about her major. She told me, in effect: “I don’t know what to do? I have this degree in advertising but now I have come to see that advertising simply encourages people to consume more and more stuff and all this consumption is destroying everything—our water, our soil, our air.” I like my major but I want to make a positive difference in the world, not contribute to more problems. I am so lost…. As I listened, it occurred to me that Sue was suffering from the disabling belief that there was only one way she could apply her advertising/marketing skills. As we talked, I saw that what she really wanted was to be a part of an organization that was protecting the environment, like The Sierra Club or Greenpeace. I asked her if these organizations might benefit by having someone with her skills—e.g., someone who could help them deliver their “messages” with more cogency and power or someone who could help them mount more effective fund-raising campaigns? Suddenly a way opened for her. Ronak’s Story: Ronak was a Hotel and Restaurant Management major. Like Sue, he had taken my environmental science course and thought that I might extend a sympathetic ear to him. As I listened, I learned that Ronak had selected his major on pragmatic grounds—e.g., lots of job opportunities. Now, on the eve of his graduation from Penn State he had discovered that his heart’s deepest yearning was to be part of a spiritual community. And, suddenly, the idea of working as a Junior Manager for big hotel in Miami Beach no longer inspired him. I watched as his demeanor shifted from despair to acute curiosity when I informed him that there are hundreds upon hundreds of spiritual retreat centers located throughout the U.S. and that these centers are continually hosting guests who come for workshops and retreats. “How is it that these centers manage to host (house 7 and feed) all their visitors?” I asked. Ronak got it, of course. They need people with exactly the set of skills he had acquired in his major. Dennis’ Story: Dennis received his degree in Golf Course Management. In the course of his studies, he, too, took my environmental science course and learned to his surprise that heavy fertilizer, pesticide and water use, associated with golf courses, can pollute groundwater and deplete aquifers. Though Dennis was excited about managing a golf course, he was troubled that, through his work, he might be causing harm to the environment. Hearing his concern, I told him about the efforts that some progressive golf course managers were making to eliminate the use of pesticides and to landscape their courses in ways that dramatically reduce the need for watering while creating habitat beneficial to wildlife. Suddenly, Dennis saw how, through his work, he might be part of a solution, rather than part of a problem. Jean’s Story: Then there is Jean, a Biology major, who I met during the second semester of her senior year when she took my Field Ecology course. During the semester I watched as Jean became more and more open to expressing her doubts about the rightness of her major. But then, as graduation time approached, Jean decided to go to graduate school in Biology, reasoning that this would be the most prudent thing to do since she had already spent four years majoring in Biology. Jean’s grades were good and her GRE scores were solid so I assumed that she would be accepted to graduate school. However, she was rejected by all seven of the graduate programs she applied to. Though Jean was temporarily stunned by this set back, I encouraged her to see it as an invitation to find her true calling. In an email she sent me shortly after graduation she wrote: “I had my future planned out and now I’m being forced to rethink, well, everything. I won’t lie though, it is probably for the better seeing how my interests have been evolving… But I’m pretty overwhelmed about what to do in the immediate future and really don’t even know where to start. I’m just treading water until I find some clarity.” A year letter I received a handwritten letter from her wherein she informed me that she had moved to Maine. Among other things she wrote: “I have fallen in love with this place.” And of her job at Maine’s Ferry Beach Ecology School: “The days are 14 hours long and I make little money but I have a room overlooking the ocean and when the waves crash my bed sometimes shakes. I have met amazing people who work for the love of it and spend all their time in the moment with little regard for any long-term plan. And it freaks me out but slowly all the pressure I have been putting on myself to figure out my future is melting away and for once I am totally happy.” She concludes: “What happens after this is uncertain but the current moment is a wonderful gift. I am having so much fun….” Not all young folks are as courageous as Sue, Ronak, Dennis, and Jean. I see these four as soul heroes. In this vein, Parker Palmer (1998) believes that the act of committing to one’s soul’s calling is, in effect, deciding to “live divided no more.” In other words, the soul hero refuses to live on the outside in ways that contradict the truths that are part of his/her essence. In so doing soul heroes serve as beacons for others, manifesting lives of integrity. Palmer calls the decision “to live divided no more” the “Rosa Parks Decision” for it was Rosa Parks, a black woman living in Alabama, who decided that she would not 8 pretend to accept on the outside what she knew, in her heart, to be fundamentally wrong. So by taking a seat in the front of the bus (instead of in the designated zone in the back) Parks stood up with her whole undivided being. We, just as Parks, become fearless when we realize that there is no punishment—not public criticism, not jail, not physical beating—that could come close to equaling the punishment we do to ourselves when we collude in our own diminishment by separating from our soul’s deep calling. Bringing Your Calling Fully to Life The biggest obstacle deterring young people from following their calling is “social conditioning.” For example, imagine that you are 17 and you know in the depths of your being that your calling is to be a musician. You have no doubt: It is music more than anything else that makes your heart sing! But still you hesitate, immobilized by all those voices in your head saying things like: “You can’t be a musician.” “Who do you think you are?” “You are not good enough.” “Be practical.” Do you want to end up on the street playing the harmonica with a tin cup in front of you?” These are not the voices emanating from your fearless soul. Rather, they are voices implanted into your psyche by a culture that fails to honor and nurture your soul’s deepest yearnings. As such, these voices are designed to engender fear and thereby keep you in line so that you don’t rock the proverbial boat. Tragically, the young person who succumbs to these voices remains asleep to the magnificence of what it means to be born human. It is possible to break free of the constraints, both imagined and real, imposed by culture. And, fortunately, now at the rise of the third millennium, there are new cultural voices arising, voices that offer a profoundly empowering understanding of human purpose and potential. These new voices are grounded: not in separation but in relationship; not in limitation but in possibility; not in control but in freedom; not in fear but in love. As such, these new voices cultivate, not soul cowards but, soul heroes. Central to these new more empowering voices is the understanding that we human beings are not separate, but intimately connected to each other and to everything else in the Universe. Indeed, modern physics reveals that each of us is, most essentially, a packet of pulsating energy situated in a vast sea of potentiality. Yes, we are constantly interacting, energetically, with everything in the Universe, both near and far, whether we know it or not. This means, in effect, that things have no meaning in isolation; they are only understandable in the context of a web of dynamic interrelationships. As McTaggart (2007; pg. xix, xx)) puts it, “The universe [is] not a storehouse of static, separate objects, but a single organism of interconnected energy fields in a continuous state of becoming. At its infinitesimal level, our world resembles a vast network of quantum information, with all its component parts constantly on the phone.” We Are an Energy Field Within an Energy Field Most people define themselves [as a finite physical] body, but you’re not a finite body. Even under a microscope you’re an energy field. What we know about energy is this: You go to quantum physicist and you say, “What creates the world?” And he or she will say, “Energy.” Well, describe energy… “OK, it can never be created or 9 destroyed; it always was, and always has been; everything that ever existed always exist; it’s moving into form, though form and out of form.” You go to a theologian and ask the question, “What created the Universe?” And she will say, “God.” OK describe God. “Always was and always has been; never can be created or destroyed; all that ever was, always will be; always moving into form, though form and out of form.” You see, it’s the same description, just differently terminology. So if you think you’re this “meat suit” running around, think again. You’re a spiritual being! You’re an energy field, operating in a larger energy field (James Ray in Byrne, 2007; pgs 158-159). Einstein in his prescience expressed it this way: “A human being is part of the whole, called by us “universe”… He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest—a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.” Since each of us is, most essentially, energy, it should not surprise you to learn that your thoughts are energy. Indeed, your thought “energy” takes the form of light—not the kind of “light” that is detectable by the human eye, but bona fide light that can be measured as photons by sensitive equipment. Metaphorically speaking, we are each like stars—balls of energy generating, by virtue of our thoughts, a steady stream of glowing photons that pass from us out into the universe, affecting everything in their path. The implications of these findings have great relevance for the young person setting out to pursue his/her unique calling. Why? Because they reveal that each of us has the potential to determine our destiny with our thoughts and intentions. Indeed, it appears the Buddha had it right 2500 years ago when he said, “All that we are is a result of what we have thought.” In other words, to a significant extent, you have the life you have now because of your past thoughts. It is those largely those thoughts that have “materialized” your life. Think of it this way. Your thoughts are energy and all energy vibrates at a frequency. This means that the frequency of energy you broadcast out to the universe differs depending on what you are thinking. Meanwhile, the constellation of elements that comprise your calling also vibrates at a frequency. Enter The Law of Attraction—the basic law of the Universe which says that like attracts like. Energetically speaking this means that the frequency of your thought energy has a way of attracting and bringing back to you things which are energetically compatible or so the theory goes. To the extent that this is true it means that each of us, in effect, thinks and speaks our life into existence (Byrne, 2006). CONCLUSION The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you. Don’t go back to sleep. You must ask for what you really want. Don’t go back to sleep. People are going back and forth across the doorsill where the two worlds touch. The door is round and open. Don’t go back to sleep. -Jelaluddin Rumi 10 Never before in the history of humankind has a culture said to its young (as we now do): “It’s a dog-eat-dog world out there. Study hard so that you can get ahead of those around you. The goal of life is to accumulate money and the things money can buy; this will bring you happiness.” This is a alienating and soulless message for we all know, deep down, that life is not primarily about greedily taking care of one’s self. There is no genuine fulfillment, no life, in that. We are not here on Earth, primarily, to make money. Rather each of us is a unique part of the human family. Now it is our turn to ensure that the human story continues and deepens. In this context the question for all of us is not how are we going to make a killing in the money market, but how are we going create the conditions wherein our grandchildren and their children, and “all our relations”—i.e., the winged ones and the four-leggeds—can flourish on this planet we have been graced to visit for a short time? This is a question that calls forth our bigness and fullness of being. It is a question that we can only by answered by “hushing” and listening to our souls. References Beck, M. 2001.

        <title>ENGR110 Design Process Case Study Project Professors Thomas, Magliula and Thangaraj Please note the following important dates for this project: You have learned that the Engineering Design Process consists of a number of steps, as diagrammed below. Your assignment is to find a scholarly article or trade journal article accessed through a RWU library database that describes the process of creating an actual product (broadly defined so that it includes cars, consumer electronics, buildings, bridges, etc.). After you locate the article, you will write a report following the guidelines below. To assist you in your search, we will be visited in class by a RWU librarian, who will offer you some guidance on how to search for a useful case study. Use the table below to assist you in evaluating the sources that you find, to know quickly if they will be useful. Task Due Date Project Introduced October 27, 2015 Final Report Due December 8, 2015 Phase Hallmarks to look for Define the problem • List of criteria for success • Description of client need(s) ENGR110 Design Process Case Study Project Professors Thomas, Magliula and Thangaraj Your article MUST come from one of the journals on the approved list, which can be found at the end of this document. The specific steps to complete this project are described below: Step 1 – Find an article. During your search, please keep a record of the steps you take. You will use this record to complete one of the required parts of the final report. Step 2 – Write a report that contains the following sections (in the order presented below): • Section 1: Introduction: a. In your introduction, describe this assignment in your own words. Write it so that someone who is not familiar with the class or with this assignment can understand what the report contains. b. In your introduction, be sure to discuss the Design Process, and why it is important. This should be written so that someone unfamiliar with this assignment will understand what you are doing and why you are doing it. • Section 2: The search: c. Begin this section with a description of the product – answering questions such as: how it is used, what problem(s) it solves, where it is located, among others that you deem relevant. Gather information • Look for word that describe HOW the information was gathered: survey of people, land surveyed, meetings with clients, interviews, market studies, literature search, patent search, etc • If the passage does not describe how the information was gathered IT IS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF gathering information Multiple solutions • Look for short descriptions of various solutions to the problem • Also – drawings or computer renderings of possible solutions Analyze and Select • Look for the criteria on which solutions were judged • Look for results of computer simulation, especially FEA results. • Look for the word: selected, chosen, picked Test and implement • Looked for description of the actual construction process in words • Photos of the finished project ENGR110 Design Process Case Study Project Professors Thomas, Magliula and Thangaraj d. Next describe the resource in which you found your article (give the name of the journal or magazine, what kind of journal/magazine it is, and why you classify it as such). e. Finally, describe how you found the resource and why you followed the path you did (for example, if the product you found discusses the design of a new kind of light bulb, you need to explain why you wanted to study the design of a new kind of light bulb). Use the record you kept of how you went about the search to aid you in writing this section. Your description should include any false leads, or paths you went down that did not work out as planned. Please write your description in words, without relying on screenshots. • Section 3: How can others find it: Provide a single screenshot that shows your article came from a RWU library database. This screenshot must have a caption. In the caption, give the name of both the RWU library database it came from and the name of the journal. • Section 4: The Engineering Design Process in Context: Consider the steps of the design process as diagrammed above (the steps are: “Define the problem”, “Gather information”, “Generate multiple solutions”, “Analyze and select a solution”, “Test and implement solution.”). f. Select 3 passages or images from the article that are easily classified into steps in the Design Process. The 3 passages must come from 3 different Design Process steps. Copy the passages into your paper, and explain why the passages or images are examples of the steps and/or processes. g. Please note that any passages you choose to represent the “Gathering information” step must clearly define the process by which the information was gathered. This will help you to avoid confusing the “Gathering information” step with the “Define the problem” step. • Section 5: include a formal bibliographic entry, using the APA style of citations, at the end of your paper. Refer to the following information for help in writing your citation: The APA (American Psychological Association) style is commonly used to cite sources within the sciences. For more information, please consult the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, (6th ed., 2nd printing). The following examples show how your citation should look in APA style: General Example: ENGR110 Design Process Case Study Project Professors Thomas, Magliula and Thangaraj Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year of publication). Title of article. Title of Journal, volume number (issue number if available), pages. http://www.someaddress.com/full/url Specific Examples: Harlow, H. F. (1983). Fundamentals for preparing psychology journal articles. Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 55 (1), 893-896. http://www.someaddress.com/ full/url Henry, W. A., III. (1990, April 9). Making the grade in today’s schools. Time, 135, 28-31. http://www.someaddress.com/full/url • Section 6: Resource: Submit a copy of the article with the passages highlighted. Since this assignment is to be submitted electronically to Bridges, you will have figure out how to electronically highlight the passages in your article. Do not simply cut and paste plain text from the article – you must keep the article intact and highlight the appropriate passages.

Your assignment is to find a scholarly article or trade journal article accessed through a RWU library database that describes the process of creating an actual product (broadly defined so that it includes cars, consumer electronics, buildings, bridges, etc.). After you locate the article, you will write a report following the guidelines below. To assist you in your search, we will be visited in class by a RWU librarian, who will offer you some guidance on how to search for a useful case study. Use the table below to assist you in evaluating the sources that you find, to know quickly if they will be useful. Task Due Date Project Introduced October 27, 2015 Final Report Due December 8, 2015 Phase Hallmarks to look for Define the problem • List of criteria for success • Description of client need(s) ENGR110 Design Process Case Study Project Professors Thomas, Magliula and Thangaraj Your article MUST come from one of the journals on the approved list, which can be found at the end of this document. The specific steps to complete this project are described below: Step 1 – Find an article. During your search, please keep a record of the steps you take. You will use this record to complete one of the required parts of the final report. Step 2 – Write a report that contains the following sections (in the order presented below): • Section 1: Introduction: a. In your introduction, describe this assignment in your own words. Write it so that someone who is not familiar with the class or with this assignment can understand what the report contains. b. In your introduction, be sure to discuss the Design Process, and why it is important. This should be written so that someone unfamiliar with this assignment will understand what you are doing and why you are doing it. • Section 2: The search: c. Begin this section with a description of the product – answering questions such as: how it is used, what problem(s) it solves, where it is located, among others that you deem relevant. Gather information • Look for word that describe HOW the information was gathered: survey of people, land surveyed, meetings with clients, interviews, market studies, literature search, patent search, etc • If the passage does not describe how the information was gathered IT IS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF gathering information Multiple solutions • Look for short descriptions of various solutions to the problem • Also – drawings or computer renderings of possible solutions Analyze and Select • Look for the criteria on which solutions were judged • Look for results of computer simulation, especially FEA results. • Look for the word: selected, chosen, picked Test and implement • Looked for description of the actual construction process in words • Photos of the finished project ENGR110 Design Process Case Study Project Professors Thomas, Magliula and Thangaraj d. Next describe the resource in which you found your article (give the name of the journal or magazine, what kind of journal/magazine it is, and why you classify it as such). e. Finally, describe how you found the resource and why you followed the path you did (for example, if the product you found discusses the design of a new kind of light bulb, you need to explain why you wanted to study the design of a new kind of light bulb). Use the record you kept of how you went about the search to aid you in writing this section. Your description should include any false leads, or paths you went down that did not work out as planned. Please write your description in words, without relying on screenshots. • Section 3: How can others find it: Provide a single screenshot that shows your article came from a RWU library database. This screenshot must have a caption. In the caption, give the name of both the RWU library database it came from and the name of the journal. • Section 4: The Engineering Design Process in Context: Consider the steps of the design process as diagrammed above (the steps are: “Define the problem”, “Gather information”, “Generate multiple solutions”, “Analyze and select a solution”, “Test and implement solution.”). f. Select 3 passages or images from the article that are easily classified into steps in the Design Process. The 3 passages must come from 3 different Design Process steps. Copy the passages into your paper, and explain why the passages or images are examples of the steps and/or processes. g. Please note that any passages you choose to represent the “Gathering information” step must clearly define the process by which the information was gathered. This will help you to avoid confusing the “Gathering information” step with the “Define the problem” step. • Section 5: include a formal bibliographic entry, using the APA style of citations, at the end of your paper. Refer to the following information for help in writing your citation: The APA (American Psychological Association) style is commonly used to cite sources within the sciences. For more information, please consult the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, (6th ed., 2nd printing). The following examples show how your citation should look in APA style: General Example: ENGR110 Design Process Case Study Project Professors Thomas, Magliula and Thangaraj Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year of publication). Title of article. Title of Journal, volume number (issue number if available), pages. http://www.someaddress.com/full/url Specific Examples: Harlow, H. F. (1983). Fundamentals for preparing psychology journal articles. Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 55 (1), 893-896. http://www.someaddress.com/ full/url Henry, W. A., III. (1990, April 9). Making the grade in today’s schools. Time, 135, 28-31. http://www.someaddress.com/full/url • Section 6: Resource: Submit a copy of the article with the passages highlighted. Since this assignment is to be submitted electronically to Bridges, you will have figure out how to electronically highlight the passages in your article. Do not simply cut and paste plain text from the article – you must keep the article intact and highlight the appropriate passages. Submit your final report to the “Design Process Case Study Project” assignment on Bridges by the deadline shown above. Your final report must be in .pdf, .doc, or .docx format. The grading rubric provided on the next page is subject to minor changes. Please note (on the rubric) that grammar and spelling count!

        <title>Civil Engineering Materials Lab CE 315 Lab #9 – 28-Day Concrete Testing Objective: Determine the 7-day compressive strength of your concrete samples and determine the modulus of elasticity and Poisson’s ratio. Apparatus Required:  Compression Machine  Compressometer with extensometer General Test procedure: 1. Initial Procedures a. Remove four cylinder samples from curing tank and dry with a towel b. Measure the length of each specimen in two locations c. Measure the diameter of the specimen in two locations using a “pi” tape 2. Compressive Strength (ASTM C39) a. Place concrete cylinder in compression testing machine with neoprene caps in-place. Be sure the compression machine is clean. b. Start the data collection software to ensure you record your peak load/stress. c. Start compression testing machine and load sample at specified load rate. d. After sample breaks, record the peak load and determine the type of break. e. Clean up sample and compression machine. 2. Modulus of Elasticity and Poisson’s Ratio (ASTM C469) a. After determining the compressive strength of your cylinders (you should leave one cylinder unbroken), place the compressometer on the remaining cylinder. b. Place the cylinder in the compression testing machine as before. c. Start the data collection software and load the sample to 40% of the compressive strength, disregard this data. Note the behavior of the gages during loading to ensure they are behaving properly. d. Start the data collection software and load the sample to 40% of the compressive strength and save the data. Be sure to download the data for your analysis. Deliverables: 1. Individual calculation sheet including: collected data (data from software should not be included), compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, and Poisson’s ratio. The calculation sheet should be typed and is due on Tuesday November 17th (must be submitted on USAOnline). 2. Option: You have the option of writing a lab report that will be graded and will replace your lowest lab report grade. The lab report may be completed as a group or individually. Notes: 1) Please calculate the Modulus of Elasticity (E) in two ways a. Secant Modulus (ACI 318): Plot the data and “fit” a linear curve to the data. The slope of the line is the Secant Modulus. Use engineering judgment when determining what data to include. b. Chord Modulus (ASTM C469): ??ℎ???=?2−?1?2−0.00005 psi, Where:  S2 = Stress at 0.4 f’c S1 = stress at a strain of 0.00005 in/in  e2 = longitudinal strain at 0.4 f’c e1 = 50.0 x 10-6 or 0.00005 in/in 2) Compare the calculated Modulus of Elasticity (E) to two empirical equations: a. Theoretical Young’s Modulus: ??ℎ???.=??1.5∗33∗√??′ psi i. wc = Unit weight from previous lab b. ACI states for “normal weight” concrete: ??ℎ???.=57,000∗ √??′ psi 3) Poisson’s ratio of concrete experimentally determined (per ASTM C 469): a. ?=??2−??1?2−?1 (dimensionless), Where i. et2 = lateral strain at 0.4 f’c ii. e2 = longitudinal strain at 0.4 f’c iii. et1= lateral strain at S1 iv. e1 = 50.0 x 10-6 b.

        <title>MSE201 Diesel Extra Credit Assignment Please provide a concise and thoughtful one-page summary of the current scandal regarding the regulation of diesel emissions. While this began with the Volkswagen brand, it has grown substantially in recent weeks. Points of interest are: 1. What emissions regulation devices were circumvented? 2. Was this hardware tampering, software tampering, or both? 3. What are the Engineering Ethics concerns? 4. What are the legal ramifications? 5. What are the financial ramifications? 6. Are there historical examples of similar technological scandals? A basic Introduction, Body and Conclusion structure is a reasonable format to use. Sentence fragments, poor grammar, and spelling errors will reflect poorly on your efforts. Focus on the most significant points and details. Citation format should systematic. MLA citation style would be appropriate, but not strictly necessary. References that cannot be found are a serious problem. Deadline: As discussed in class, the submission deadline for this Extra Credit is rolling, due to the fact that new information will be coming to light through the rest of the semester. The assignment will be graded from 0-10 points and added to the points in Quizzes and Assignments.</title>

        <title>MSE 201: Diffusion Problem for 11/4 1 You are part of a team considering the production of iridium thin-films on a metal substrate to prevent corrosion, due to iridium’s highly inert behavior. Evaporation of the iridium is achieved by resistive heating in a tungsten crucible, at the melting point of iridium. Tungsten has a melting point of 3695K, while the melting point of iridium is 2739K. Let’s assume the bulk diffusivity of any metal atom in tungsten can be approximated by: ?~0.5 ∙ ? !!”∙!!”#$!!”#!”#$% ! with units of cm2/s (T in Kelvin). If the crucible is held at 2740K until equilibrium is reached: 1. Is the iridium solid or liquid? 2. Is the tungsten solid or liquid? 3. What is the diffusion constant for iridium in tungsten in units of cm2/s? 4. How far might atoms from the iridium/tungsten interface diffuse into the crucible wall over 10 minutes in units of meters? (Use the characteristic diffusion length!) The team is also considering the use of copper as an alternative coating material. In this case the tungsten crucible will be held at 1360K, the melting point of copper: 5. What is the diffusion constant for copper in tungsten in units of cm2/s? 6.

        <title>ENGR2110: Project Description The purpose of this project is for you to develop an algorithm that can be used to estimate the payload (amount of material) for an electric mining shovel. An electric mining shovel is a large digging machine that is used to mine the world’s commodities (copper, gold, coal, etc.) A picture of an electric mining shovel is shown in Figure 1. The mining shovel has a dipper (Fig. 1) that holds all of the required material. Your job will be to determine how much material is in the dipper at a given instant in time, based on the equilibrium equations you have learned in statics. There are two main motions that allow this machine to operate properly. There is a crowd motion that is used to move the handle in and out based on a rack and pinion system. There is also a hoist motion which is controlled by a pulley system. The hoist ropes are connected directly to the dipper through the bail pin. Figure 1: Large electric mining shovel. The dipper is controlled by both a hoist motion and a crowd motion. Shown in Fig. 2 is a dipper/handle combination. There is an assumed handle center of mass. There is also an assumed dipper/payload center of mass. The rack and pinion system is also shown. The saddle pinion is controlled by a large motor which causes the pinion to rotate and there the handle as a result of the rack and pinion system. In your project, you will assume that the system geometry, hoist force, and crowd force are all known from sensors that are on the shovel. Your job will be to then back calculate the payload in the dipper given the known geometry as well as hoist and crowd forces. Figure 2: Handle and Dipper Combination The system geometry is shown below: Figure 3: Known System Geometry Assumptions In any mathematical derivation, it is important to specify all assumptions. We will assume the following. 1. All bodies are rigid. 2. Gravity is included. 3. There exists no friction in the joints. 4. There is no slacking in the hoist ropes. Project Tasks Please complete the following tasks to obtain the equations of motion of this machine. 1. Draw a free body diagram of the handle/dipper combination. You may assume that this is one rigid body. 2. Assign a coordinate system of your choosing. 3. Write out the appropriate equilibrium equations. 4. Solve for the value of the unknown mass of material of the dipper in terms of the known values. ????????=?(?ℎ????,?1,?2,?3,?4,?5,?6,?7,?,???????,?ℎ?????,?,?) Note that ????=????????+???????. Please also note that the payload value is not dependent on the crowd force. Report Once you have completed your derivation for the equation that describes the payload calculation, please write a report outlining what you have learned. Your report should have the following sections: 1. Abstract 2. Introduction 3. Payload Algorithm Derivation a. Assumptions b. Sub section c. Sub section d. Sub section 4. Conclusion Technical Writing Guidelines Your report should follow certain technical writing guidelines: o All figures clear and legible o All equations, figures, and tables numbered appropriately o References included o Clear explanations for each section o All sections numbered and labeled appropriately o Use of justified formatting for all sections o All assumptions stated clearly o Methods and equations completely described Units should never be italicized o Variables should be in italics o All coordinate systems should be clearly shown o The document should be grammatically correct Due Date: The project is due the day of the final exam, December 8th.</title>

        <title>IS441 Project Management: Course Project Assignment 2015/2016 Page 1 of 4 Imam Mohammed bin Saud University College of Computer &amp; Information Sciences Information Systems Department IS441 Project Management 2nd Semester 1435/1436 Course Project Assignment Project case: Software Training Program A company so-called “ALPHA”, has 10,000 employees and wants to increase employee productivity by setting up an internal software applications training program. The training program will teach employees how to use Microsoft software programs such as windows 7, Word 2010, Excel 2010, PowerPoint 2010, Access 2010, and Project 2010. Courses will be offered in the evenings and on Saturdays and taught by qualified volunteer employees. Instructors will be paid $40 per hour. In the past, employees were sent to courses offered by local vendors during company time. In contrast, this internal training program should save the company money on training as well as make people more productive. The Human Resources department will manage the program, and any employee can take the courses. Employees will receive a certificate for completing courses, and a copy will be put in their personnel files. The company is not sure which vendor’s off-the-shelf training materials to use. The company needs to set up a training classroom, survey employees on desired courses, find qualified volunteer instructors, and start offering courses. The company wants to offer the first courses within six months. One person from Human Resources is assigned full time to manage this project, and top management has pledged its support. IS441 Project Management: Course Project Assignment 2015/2016 Page 2 of 4 1. Project Scope Management 1) Create a WBS for this project and enter the tasks in MS Project 2010.

Some of the tasks specific to this project will be to: 2) Review off-the-shelf training materials from three major vendors and decide which materials to use. 3) Negotiate a contract with the selected vendor to its materials. 4) Develop communications information about this new training program. Disseminate the information via department meetings, e-mail, the company’s intranet, and flyers to all employees. 5) Create a survey to determine the number and type of courses needed and employees’ preferred times for taking courses. 6) Administer the survey. 7) Solicit qualified volunteers to teach the courses. 8) Review resumes, interview candidates for teaching the courses, and develops a list of preferred instructors. 9) Coordinate with the Facilities department to build two classrooms with 20 personal computers each, a teacher station, and an overhead projection system (assume that Facilities will manage this part of the project). 10) Schedule courses. 11) Develop a fair system to signing up for classes. 12) Develop a course evaluation form to assess the usefulness of each course and the instructor’s teaching ability. 13) Offer classes. 2. Project Time Management 1) Enter realistic durations for each task and then link appropriate tasks. Be sure that all tasks are linked in some fashion to the start and end of the project. Assume that you have six months to complete the entire project. 2) Print the Gantt chart view and Network Diagram view for the project. 3) Print the Schedule table to see key dates and slack times for each task. IS441 Project Management: Course Project Assignment 2015/2016 Page 3 of 4 3. Project Cost Management 1) Assume that you have four people from various departments available part time to support the fulltime Human Resources person, Terry, on the project. Assume that Terry’s hourly rate is $40. Two people from the Information Technology department will each spend up to 25% of their time supporting the project. Their hourly rate is $50. One person from the Marketing department is available 2S% of the time at $40 per hour and one person from corporate is available 30% of the time at $35 per hour. Enter this information about time and hourly wages into the Resource Sheet. Assume that the cost to build the two classrooms will be $100,000, and enter it as a fixed cost. 2) Using your best judgment, assign resources to the tasks. 3) View the Resource Graphs for each person. If anyone is over allocated, make adjustments. 4) Print the budget report for the project. 4. Project Human Resource Management 1) Assume that the Marketing person ‘Nill be unavailable for one week, two months into the project, and for another week, four months into the project. Make adjustments to accommodate this unavailability, so the schedule does not slip and costs do not change. Document the changes from the original plan and the new plan. 2) Add to each resource a 5% raise that starts three months into the project. Print a new budget report 3) Use the Resource Usage view to see each person’s work each month. Print a copy. 5. Project Communications Management 1) Print a Gantt chart for this project Use a timescale that enables the chart to fit on one page. Then copy a picture of the same Gantt chart in PowerPoint and print out the slide. 2) Print a “To-do-List” report for each team member. 3) Review some of the other reports and print out one that you think would help in managing the project.

The training program will teach employees how to use Microsoft software programs such as windows 7, Word 2010, Excel 2010, PowerPoint 2010, Access 2010, and Project 2010. Courses will be offered in the evenings and on Saturdays and taught by qualified volunteer employees. Instructors will be paid $40 per hour. In the past, employees were sent to courses offered by local vendors during company time. In contrast, this internal training program should save the company money on training as well as make people more productive. The Human Resources department will manage the program, and any employee can take the courses. Employees will receive a certificate for completing courses, and a copy will be put in their personnel files. The company is not sure which vendor’s off-the-shelf training materials to use. The company needs to set up a training classroom, survey employees on desired courses, find qualified volunteer instructors, and start offering courses. The company wants to offer the first courses within six months. One person from Human Resources is assigned full time to manage this project, and top management has pledged its support.
