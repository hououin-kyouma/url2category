            <div class="sc_team_content"> 
             <p>Just as some people are born to become athletes, scientists, or musicians, Mindi Levins-Pfeifer found her calling in life at a young age. She was born to instill hope in young people, even in the most dire of circumstances. It is a passion that has driven her throughout her career—a career that now spans more than two decades and has been singularly focused on helping youth in crisis.</p> 
             <p>After receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology from UCLA, Mindi spent more than a decade working with street kids as a case manager and director at the Los Angeles Youth Network (LAYN). Following that important work, Mindi returned to school to obtain a Master’s degree in Social Work at Cal State Long Beach and began consulting for Free Clinics throughout the greater Los Angeles area.</p> 
             <p>It was during this time – after spending years of working for others to help underserved youth – that Mindi and her husband, Robert, discovered a bigger dream. One only they could fulfill.</p> 
             <p>Recognizing the need for a different kind of treatment program for young adults struggling with addiction, they utilized their unique expertise and resources to open Sober College’s doors in 2005. In doing so, they effectively redefined rehab for young people and their families.</p> 
             <p>Since then, and as part of her work at Sober College, Mindi has been dedicated to helping clients conquer their addictions. But she does more than that. She is also tireless in her endeavor to help her young clients rediscover the joys in life and redefine life’s limits.</p> 
             <p>When she’s not helping the young people on Sober College’s campus, Mindi is at home, enjoying life with Robert and their children, Ben and Sarah.</p>

             <p>Holly Daniels, PhD, LMFT, is a licensed marriage and family therapist, meditation teacher and mental health advocate. She brings her many years of experience working in dual diagnosis treatment to her role as Clinical Systems Director at Sober College. After earning her degree in clinical psychology, Holly worked for many years as a primary therapist at Monte Nido and Associates, the Valley Community Clinic and The Canyon residential treatment center in Malibu, where she specialized in treating those with complex issues including co-occurring addictions, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and associated mood and anxiety disorders.<br> As the Clinical Systems Director at Sober College, Holly contributes her complex clinical expertise to enhance and support clinical operations within Sober College treatment centers and utilizes her passion for relationship building and business development to collaborate with professionals and families in the recovery and mental health communities. Holly shares Sober College’s dedication to encouraging and promoting self-discovery and resiliency toward long-term, sustained recovery for every young adult who comes in for treatment. She feels fortunate to be able to continue her life’s work alongside the compassionate, expert, invigorating team at Sober College.<br> A mother to two teenagers, Holly relies on her personal daily meditation practice to bring balance to her own life, and she enjoys teaching meditation and mindfulness skills to others. “I believe,” explains Holly, “that healing involves building connections with other healthy people and creating fulfilling, meaningful life experiences outside of treatment. Sober College offers young adults opportunities to do just that.” Holly loves watching clients grow, heal, learn gratitude and develop passions as they practice interacting with the world in life-affirming ways. “I feel fortunate to be part of such an innovative and effective team, and honored to be even a small part of our clients’ journeys.”</p>

CJ is the Clinical Supervisor at Sober College.</p> 
             <p>CJ has over 25 years of experience working with adolescents and Transitional Aged Youth (TAY) populations. She began her career working in Group Homes as a Child Care Worker in 1987 and her primary focus throughout her careers has been working with clients who are dual-diagnosed with addiction and mental health disorders. </p> 
             <p>CJ has a strong passion for helping clients become the person they want to be rather than the person they feel stuck being. CJ encourages clients to create their “own, unique story” rather than to live in the “problem-saturated story” that has shaped their often unhappy realities. </p> 
             <p>CJ’s philosophy is that hope is manufactured by cleansing the wounds from the past and choosing a direction that heals the soul. </p>

             <p>“Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joy—the experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light.” – Brené Brown </p>

             <p>Mike earned his BA in Psychology, and his Master’s degree in Social Work at California State University, Northridge. Mike has experience in clinical and case management aspects of recovery, and has been working in the field since exiting his graduate school program in 2015. Mike has had a passion for working with the 18 -26 year old demographic who struggle with addiction since he began his own journey in recovery from alcohol in 2008. Mike was drawn to Sober College because of his own experience involving education coupled with sobriety, and how important it is to recognize the idea of responsibility in real-life settings early on. “The thing is,” Mike states “that without having the structured program that Sober College provides, clients begin to get comfortable with life without responsibilities. This, in my experience, is a sure way to begin romanticizing usage and endangers the client’s ability to maintain long-term sobriety.”</p>

Matt graduated from the Sober College School of Addiction Studies Drug &amp; Alcohol Counselor Training Program in 2016, and passed his CADC II test. He is now a Certified Drug and Alcohol Counselor. Four months after graduating, Matt became a Men’s Counselor here at Sober College.</p>

Matt often serves as the Emcee of the monthly talent show, and serves as founder, organizer and host of Sober College’s Soberaoke Night. Matt believes that, “these young people are at a crossroads in their lives. It is possible that they are just one good memory away from never again needing to rely on drugs and/or alcohol.”</p>

Nick has been “straight-edged” his whole life, meaning he has never once touched drugs or alcohol, and is grateful to say that most of his family is now in recovery. Nick states: “I am so grateful to be able to work for Sober College and to be able to be a part of, and give back to, the programs that gave me my family back.”</p>

             <p>Rachel developed the Drugs and Alcohol in Popular Culture course specifically for the Sober College student. It is Rachel’s goal to help students develop a sociological perspective on drug and alcohol use and addiction through the study of American popular culture. In this course the student is the expert; they are hugely familiar with both the culture they live in as well as with their personal experiences surrounding drug and alcohol use. We use this expertise to critique and analyze the beliefs surrounding drugs and drug use in our society. Students will discover how beliefs are transmitted to the general population and how in turn those beliefs continually influence our understanding of drugs, alcohol and those that use.</p> 
             <p>Rachel enjoys introducing new material in innovative ways and showing students how sociology is a part of their everyday lives. The aspect that she loves most about teaching is the interaction with the students. Rachel adds, “Developing a rapport with students is very important to me. Receiving positive feedback from students about my ability to maintain a safe and fun classroom environment is very rewarding and one of the reasons why I love what I do. As a teacher within a therapeutic community, it is perhaps most rewarding to see the positive effects in my students’ lives as a result of the study of sociology. It is amazing to watch students process the academic information presented in class and, in turn, transmute it to tangible and identifiable action and positive change in their search for recovery.”</p>

             <p>Ian Mcloughlin is an alumni of Sober College. He graduated from our program in 2011, and went on to complete his bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from St. Mary’s College of California.

             <p>“I came back to work at Sober College because I wanted to help young adults that are going through what I went through,” Ian explains, “Now, I get to work with both clients and families who are looking for help, while giving back to the place that saved my life.

             <p>Max began working here in 2012. Beginning as a Mentor, Max quickly moved up the ladder and became the Sober Living Coordinator. As an alumnus of the program himself, Max has always had gratitude and a passion for what we do here at Sober College but once he began helping other clients similar to him, his passion for this field grew. “I really started feeling a connection and a passion while I was working with clients,” Max says, “I wanted to give back the blessing that was given to me.”</p> 
             <p>Encouraged by his mother, Max ctook the Sober College School of Addiction Studies program and received the education he needed to take his career to the next level. “[Taking the CADC classes] is when I really started having a new found perspective on treatment. I knew then that this is what I wanted to do and I was in it for the long run.” Interested in getting involved in different parts of the treatment industry, Max transitioned into the Admission Department in 2017. Max brings a wealth of experience to the Admissions team and is able to personally relate to what our clients and their families are going through. “Being sober now, I am now on a different end of the spectrum and enjoy every moment of it.

Having been on both sides of the table, she is able to understand not only the hard work and dedication that it takes to work in treatment, but also the questions, concerns, and fears that potential clients and their families are dealing with when looking for treatment center. “My goal for the website, as well as the interactions I have with young adults and their families, is to make this difficult process as easy as possible by providing them with the information they need to make the decision that works best for them.” Through her experience in the field, Julia understands that the best program for one person may not be the best program for another. “All I can do though the web, over the phone and in person is share what I know personally to be true about addiction, recovery and Sober College.” Julia jokes, “I have the easiest job in the world!

             <p>Britney David completed the alcohol and drug counseling studies program at Intercoast College in Burbank, California. For her practicum hours she interned at Able Family Support in Panorama City, then transitioned to Action Family Counseling’s Studio City Intensive Outpatient Program where she completed her hours. She then moved on to Action Family Counseling’s corporate office where she worked for three years in the Admissions, Intake, and assisting the billing department. While at Action she also participated in weekly group counseling providing services to at risk youth. After Action, Britney found her niche and began working for a recovery call center where she quickly moved up and began managing her fellow employees.</p> 
             <p>Britney joined the Sober College team with years of experience in admissions, billing, and insurance verification experience and looks forward to growing with this company. “As soon as I came across Sober College I knew I wanted to be a part of this organization,” explains Britney, “I was inspired by the program and the attention they pay to truly helping young people recover.” While not in recovery herself, Britney has personal experience dealing with addiction in her family. This has driven her to pursue her career not only in insurance but in counseling. “I love knowing that I am part of a solution and can offer a helping hand to those who need it most.” Britney looks forward to pursing her career within this industry and day by day adds it to a piece of her journey.</p>

             <p>Michelle began working at Sober College in 2015. Michelle was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley, and prior to working at Sober College she had worked in retail for almost six years. While working in retail Michelle learned how to provide great customer service and to manage difficult situations. During this time she also discovered her passion for helping people and decided to make a change. Michelle then began working at an adult day program with elderly clients and clients with disabilities. Within a year she was promoted to Administrative Assistant, where she performed client intakes and managed the day to day of the office. After taking time off to start her family, she decided to return to work and began her time at Sober College. Michelle loves how Sober College is so warm and welcoming and helps so many young people and their families. She says, “Sober College offers a great program for young adults and it is amazing to see all the cool and fun activities at Sober College and the impact they have on both the clients and their families.”</p>
