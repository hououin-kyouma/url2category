            The Beautiful Hands of a Priest
           </div></h2> 
          <div align="center">
            We need them in life's early morning. 
           <br> We need them again at its close; 
           <br> We feel their clasp of true 
           <br> Friendship, we seek them when tasting life's woes. 
           <br> At the altar each day we behold them, 
           <br> And the hands of a king on his throne 
           <br> Are not equal to them in their 
           <br> Greatness: their dignity stands all alone; 
           <br> And when we are tempted and wander 
           <br> To pathways of shame and of sin, 
           <br> It's the hand of a priest that will absolve us 
           <br> --- not once, but again and again. 
           <br> And when we are taking life's partner, 
           <br> Other hands may prepare us a feast, 
           <br> But the hand that will bless and unite 
           <br> Us is the beautiful hand of a priest. 
           <br> God bless them and keep them all holy 
           <br> For the Host which their fingers caress; 
           <br> When can a poor sinner do better than 
           <br> To ask Him to guide thee and bless? 
           <br> When the hour of death comes upon us 
           <br> May our courage and strength be increased 
           <br> By seeing raised over us in blessing the 
           <br> Beautiful hands of a priest --

How else could he speak God's word, ordinary man that he is?

The ‘monastery' is an essential dialectical element in Christianity.

But if there really is true Christianity in every generation, there must also be individuals who have this need -- Soren Kierkegaard <br><br> The contemplative waits in silence and when he is 'answered', it is not so much by a word that bursts into his silence.

Henri J. Nouwen <br><br> A thousand half-loves must be surrendered to take a whole heart home. Rumi <br><br> Tears and weeping indicate a significant frontier in the way of the desert.
