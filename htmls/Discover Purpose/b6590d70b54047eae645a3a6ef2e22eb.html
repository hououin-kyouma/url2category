     <h3>Fall 2017&nbsp;Courses</h3> 
     <p><strong>THEO20103&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One Jesus &amp; His Many Portraits</strong><br> This course explores the many different faith-portraits of Jesus painted by various books of the New Testament: e.g., from suffering servant abandoned by God through high priest interceding with God to Godself. In each case, the course will ask how this particular portrait did or did not have an impact on subsequent Christian faith and what it may say to faith in Christ today. The course will combine a lecture format with discussions, readings, and reflections on the readings.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20243&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martyrs &amp; Martyrdom</strong><br> Suffering and salvation have been linked in Christianity since the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth in first-century Jerusalem. From the diverse contexts and cultural currents that informed it in the world of the ancient Mediterranean, to the persecution of Christians in multiple countries today, martyrdom has played a centrally important role in the experience, imagination, theology, and memory of Christians. It is inextricable from questions about persecution and power, death and identity, suffering and truth. This course examines the experiences, representations, reception, and place of martyrs in the early church and Christian tradition more broadly. We will analyze together the importance of martyrdom for the definition and development of Christian doctrine, ecclesiology, and devotion, and consider the influence of these in turn on attitudes about persecution, the imitation of Christ, and martyrdom itself.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20254&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.S. Lewis: Sin, </strong><strong>Sanctification</strong><strong> and Saints</strong><br> What is the path for sanctification to the beatific vision? Using the fiction of C.S. Lewis for signposts on the path, this course will consider the doctrine of sin (Screwtape Letters), sanctification as cooperating with grace (The Lion, the Witch &amp; the Wardrobe, Perelandra), and the final formation of saints (The Great Divorce, The Last Battle). Other authors will be helpful in understanding Christian spirituality as a struggle to cultivate the virtues and overcome the passions: Augustine, Maximus Confessor, Sayings of the Desert Fathers, Dorothy Sayers, Joseph Pieper, and G.K. Chesterton.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20401&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Church and Worship</strong><br> This course will analyze the church as a mystical body of believers that expresses its faith and lives out its relationship to God through liturgy. The course will center around three key areas, namely (1) Anthropology: Why do humans pursue ritual activity as a means of interaction with the spiritual? What forms did religious ritual take in the ancient Jewish and pre-Christian Graeco-Roman worlds? (2) Theology: How does the Christian belief in the incarnation enrich this anthropology of ritual? What are the ecclesiological underpinnings of the Church's liturgy? How do the Church's sacraments anticipate and actualize the age to come? (3) History: How has the Church's sacramental life developed over time? What has remained constant in spite of historical change?</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20424&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holy Communion and Disunity</strong><br> This course is part of the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, exploring the differences between Christians and their hopes for reunion. The Eucharist, or Holy Communion, is understood by all the churches to be a sign of Christians' unity with one another and with Christ. From the period of the Reformation, however, communion has become a sign and instrument of disunity between Christians of different denominations. This course will begin by looking at ecumenical agreements about the Eucharist after Vatican II, and then examine the development of the understanding of communion through church history, including disputes over how the Eucharist should be celebrated and received, questions of Christ's presence in the Eucharist, and the idea that the Eucharist is a sacrifice.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20425&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nuptial Mystery</strong><br> This course introduces students to the study of theology through attention to the sacrament of marriage. The structure of the course, drawn from the rite of marriage, seeks to understand the nature of divine and human love and how this love is salvific for the human person. The course, grounded in historical study, will introduce students to major sources for Christian theology. The class will treat themes related to a natural theology of love; the understanding of God as lover within the Scriptures and the Tradition; sexual ethics and a theology of family life; and, a spirituality of marriage in the modern age.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20606&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theology of Marriage</strong><br> This course seeks to introduce participants to the principal elements in the Catholic Tradition on marriage by examining the sources of this tradition in sacred scripture, the work of ancient Christian writers, the official teachings of the Church and recent theological reflection. The method employed in the course is thus historical, scriptural, and thematic. The readings selected for this course are intended to expose students to contemporary discussion in moral theology apropos of these issues and provide them with the necessary theological tools to critically evaluate a wide variety of ethical positions dealing with marriage in the Catholic tradition.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20619&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich, Poor, and War</strong><br> This course examines the economic dimensions of violence in light of Catholic social teaching and Western political and economic thought. After an in-depth overview of Catholic social teaching in relation to alternative social theories, we bring them to bear on the issue of violence in three social spheres: the domestic (domestic abuse and sexual assault), the economic (sweatshops), and the international political (war). In each case we will examine Catholic responses to the problem.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20625&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discipleship: Loving Action</strong><br> This course is designed for students who have completed a Summer Service Project Internship (SSLP or ISSLP) or Social Enterprise Microfinance Internship (SEMI). It affords students the opportunity to re-engage their immersion experiences. Students will employ tools of social analysis, theological reflection, and rhetoric relative to both topics such as hunger, homelessness, poverty, incarceration, and immigration, and themes such as freedom, solidarity, mimesis, power, and the preferential option for the poor. The goal of the course is to develop a theology of discipleship to which justice is integral, including considerations of worship, sustainability, social reconciliation and restorative justice.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20639&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theology, Ethics, and Business</strong><br> This course is intended to be an introduction to Catholic moral theology customized for those discerning a career as a business professional. In the wake of ethical failures at a number of prominent corporations, business leaders have renewed their call for ethical behavior and have begun to establish criteria for hiring morally thoughtful employees and to institute ethics education in the workplace. This is a move which has prompted a number of questions. Are institutions of higher education or small groups of well-meaning business professionals capable of training people to behave ethically? Is the real problem in contemporary business a lack of ethical knowledge, a lack of skill in applying rules to particular cases, or a lack of sensitivity to morally relevant issues? In the first part of the course, we will examine philosophical, theological, and economic interpretations of our current business situation, and we will consider various approaches to thinking about the ethical dimensions of business. In the second part of the course, we will examine the tradition of Catholic theology as a virtue ethics tradition, considering how virtue relates to happiness, law, moral judgment, and one's professional vocation. Third, we will examine Catholic theologies of work and the tradition of Catholic social teaching, with special attention to the relationship between workers and management as well as the norms of justice that ought to govern these relations. The course will conclude with student presentations of original cases.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20643&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Askesis of Nonviolence</strong><br> This course will explore the theology and practice of nonviolence as a form of askesis, or spiritual discipline. The material will include readings from Scripture, the early Christian tradition, and Catholic social teaching. Religious sources outside the Christian tradition will include Gandhi, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Badshah Khan. This course will use the method of community-based learning and will require 20 hours of service at particular sites in the South Bend area.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20658&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theology of Nature</strong><br> What is nature and why should we care about it? This question structures the intellectual arc of THEO 20658, a course designed to explore answers from the perspective of the Christian theological tradition. As such, relevant, subsidiary questions may provide guidance such as, "what is God's/humanity's relationship to nature?" - "are humans part of nature?" - "does Christian faith require us to protect the environment?" - "do animals go to heaven?", "does the theory of evolution conflict with Christian belief?" - "what's for dinner?" We will trace responses to these and other questions from the Bible, the early Christian church, the Middle Ages, and from contemporary theological reflection.&nbsp; Since a hallmark of the American response to the environment - both inspiration from its inherent beauty and condemnation of/social action regarding its degradation by humans - can be found in the genre of literature known as "nature writing," we also will correlate Christian theology with select American nature writers.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20659&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; War, Peace, Revolution</strong><br> What is the relationship between God's work of salvation and human political responsibility? This course builds upon the "foundations" provided in the first theology course to trace this classic question of Christian theology through historic developments in Christian perspectives on war, peace and revolution. While the relationship between divine and human action is our central question, it refracts in a number of diverse and at times contradictory ways across the tradition from the New Testament to today. Thus, we will 1) analyze how doctrines regarding sin, salvation, the Church and the Reign of God are worked out politically with regard to the use or rejection of violence; 2) attend to the ways in which the social and political positions of Christians shape their theological affirmations; and 3) deploy the theological grammar generated by our study to analyze contemporary practical and pastoral concerns regarding war, peace, and revolution. During the first half of the semester, we will explore how Christian perspectives on violence changed as Christianity went from a persecuted minority to a bearer of imperial power. During the second half of the semester, we will run from the Middle Ages to the 20th century three times: first to discuss the growth of just war theory, second to discuss the evolution of peace concern, and third to discuss the tradition of Christian revolutionary violence. The class is divided overall into six short segments. Students will write a short position paper at the end of each segment, which will become the basis for a class discussion.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20666&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intro to Christian Ethics</strong><br> Faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and savior has practical implications for the way believers construe the world, organize their lives and engage with the world. In this course students will be introduced to the basic elements in Christian moral thinking and decision making. We will look at nature of ethics in general and of Christian ethics in particular. We will cover questions related to the specificity of Christian ethics, Jesus and moral thinking, the human (Christian) person as moral agent, and the different methods employed in making ethical decisions. This course is therefore a foundational course which is meant to prepare students for further studies in moral theology and ethics or for life as responsible Christian men and women who are reasonably well equipped to face up to the implications of their faith for life in the world.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20702&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why the Church?</strong><br> Studies show that teen and young adults are leaving the Church in large numbers and that the ones who stay don’t grasp Church teachings. Seeking to “meet them where they are,” the course begins with an examination of contemporary trends in the religious lives of millennials, with a particular focus on Catholics. It proceeds to examine the major reasons why millennials are leaving the Catholic Church, as reported by a recent Pew Forum study and engage students in arguments for and against the Church’s positions. We will also look at the case for the Church through beauty and the witness of the saints, modes of engagement that are argued to be particularly persuasive to the millennial generation.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20803&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God's Grace and Human Action</strong><br> What are the respective roles of God and the human person in salvation? Are ideas of human freedom and of the value of human acts compatible with a belief in God as the source of grace and redemption? These and other questions about salvation have been hotly debated by Christian theologians throughout the centuries. This course analyses the positions articulated by such figures as Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, and Calvin, and examines how they shaped the Catholic-Protestant debate about the role of good works, and of God, in salvation.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20811&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus and Salvation</strong><br> The first Christians announced that they had experienced salvation in and through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. This course will explore the meaning of that experience and the mystery of the person of Jesus, proclaimed by Christians to be the Christ. The first part of the course will trace the main lines of contemporary efforts to reconstruct the faith journey of the first disciples which led to the preaching of the early church and the written gospels. The second section of the course will investigate the development of classic Christian doctrine about Jesus and salvation and the challenge of interpreting those doctrines in the contemporary context. The final section of the course will examine contemporary efforts to speak about the identity of Jesus, the significance of Christian faith, and what it means to hope for salvation in a world of suffering and religious and cultural pluralism. Students will be given the opportunity to explore one contemporary question of interest in-depth.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20828&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christianity &amp; World Religions</strong><br> The purpose of this course is to introduce the student to the basic teachings and spiritualties of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam. We will approach these religions both historically and theologically, seeking to determine where they converge and differ from Christianity on such perennial issues as death, meaning, the nature of the ultimate Mystery, the overcoming of suffering, etc. We will also examine some traditional and contemporary Catholic and Protestant approaches to religious pluralism. Our own search to know how the truth and experience of other faiths is related to Christian faith will be guided by the insights of important Catholic contemplatives who have entered deeply in the spirituality of other traditions. By course's end we ought to have a greater understanding of what is essential to Christian faith and practice as well as a greater appreciation of the spiritual paths of others. Requirements: Short papers, midterm exam, and final exam.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20830&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Islam and Christian Theology&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The relationship between Christianity and Islam is absolutely unique, in part because of the way Muslims challenge Christian teaching on Jesus. Muslims insist that Jesus was not god, not a savior and did not die on the Cross. Instead he was a Muslim prophet who predicted the coming of Muhammad. From a traditional Islamic perspective Christian teaching on Christ is confused and the New Testament on which it is based is a falsified version of an Islamic revelation which God gave to Jesus. Muhammad came centuries later to correct the errors of Christians and to preach the same eternal religion that Jesus once taught: Islam. Muslims, in other words, have something to say to Christians, that Jesus was a Muslim and that Muhammad is a true prophet sent to the entire world. In this course we will listen to how Muslims explain and express this idea, examine how Christians have responded through the centuries, and ask how Christians today might fruitfully promote dialogue with Islam. NO PRIOR BACKGROUND in Arabic or Islam is required for this course.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20843&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Church and Empire</strong><br> The formation of Christians' communal identity, theological imagination, and social practices have always been worked out - whether implicitly or explicitly - in relation to empire. This course explores this complex theological and historical relationship between Church and empire with particular attention to the ways Christian communities have attempted to resist the onslaught of pre-modern and modern imperialism in order to preserve the integrity of various aspects of the gospel of Christ. In the process of this exploration we will attempt, as a class, to discern some general characteristics of a counter-imperial Catholic ethos or spirituality by paying close attention to the ways the Church has compromised, negotiated, or resisted empire concerning images of Jesus, the effects of baptism, the scope of Christ's Eucharistic presence, and the legitimate modes of evangelization at the Church's disposal.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20883&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Developing Character</strong><br> This course moves in the direction of three broad questions: "What are you looking for?", "What do you love?", and "How will you live?". By attending to how these questions arise, why they are important, and how one responds to each, we will study how the Christian tradition provides an account of the meaning, dignity, and destiny of the human person, particularly in relation to the prospects for moral and spiritual growth. As the course unfolds, students will not only grow in the ability to account for the development of character in a theological framework, but also practice applying this wisdom to specific moral issues in their own lives as well as in contemporary culture.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20887&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christianity &amp; Other Religions</strong><br> This course examines some of the ways the Christian tradition has thought about other religions, and some of the practices Christians have adopted toward religious others throughout history (e.g., polemic, evangelization, warfare, coexistence, dialogue, cooperation, borrowing, etc.). Since it has been a major historical catalyst for inter-religious encounters, Christian mission will be given special attention throughout the course. Students will be encouraged to critically assess various approaches and thus to grow in their ability to think theologically, in this case, about religious diversity or pluralism. Our question is not simply, how have Christians responded to other religions, but also, how should they? Our task in this course necessarily entails an attempt to understand several non-Christian religions, living and dead. We will also be exposed to some of the ways other religions have responded to Christianity.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO20888&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science, Theology, &amp; Creation&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> This course investigates the Christian understanding of creation and how this doctrine relates to contemporary scientific issues. We will examine the development of the doctrine beginning with Scripture and the Creed and progressing through the early Church period into the Medieval and Scholastic era, focusing on the concepts of creation ex nihilo, creation continua, divine Providence, and divine action in the world. With the rise of the modern era, we will analyze the origin of and principles involved with the purported conflict between science and theology. We will bring the doctrine of creation into dialogue with three contemporary issues in the sciences: cosmology, evolution, and ecology. Integral to this course will be the relationship and response of humankind to God and to creation. This course will have a special appeal to students interested in the intersection of science and theology.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elementary Hebrew I</strong><br> This is a two-semester introductory course in biblical Hebrew; under normal circumstances, the student must complete the first to enroll in the second. The fall semester will be devoted to learning the grammar of biblical Hebrew. The spring semester will be divided into two parts. For the first six weeks we will finish and review the grammar. In the remaining part of the course we will read and translate texts from the Hebrew Bible, Qumran, and Rabbinic literature. The course will focus on developing reading and comprehension skills in biblical Hebrew through the study of biblical texts. In addition, students will learn how to use reference grammars, concordances, and apparatus to the Biblica Hebraica. The course encourages students to think about the grammatical forms and their implications for biblical interpretation.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40004 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Intermediate Hebrew</strong><br> The course is designed to develop the students' ability to read Hebrew texts and increase vocabulary while reviewing grammar. Selections for reading and analysis will be drawn from the Hebrew Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls, with some use of Modern Hebrew as well.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40101&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction to Old Testament</strong><br> This course will offer students an introductory-level survey of the books of the Hebrew Bible, with emphasis placed on the holistic (i.e., theological, literary, and social-scientific) study of the history, literature, and religion of ancient Israel. The implications of selected texts in Christian and Jewish theological discourse will also be explored. Required course components include the major divisions of the Hebrew Bible (Pentateuch, Prophets, and Writings), and writing spans the following research-related genres (case studies, article reviews, journal, and critical notes). Fall only.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40104 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Historical Jesus</strong><br> This course will be a lecture course, supplemented by readings and discussion. The purpose of this course is to introduce the student to the major historical and exegetical problems involved in the quest for the historical Jesus, especially as pursued today in the wake of the so-called “Third Quest” (ca. 1970-2000). The course will move from initial definitions and concepts, through questions of sources and criteria, to consideration of selected sayings and deeds of Jesus that may reasonably be considered historical. The course will especially focus on the correct understanding of the criteria of “historicity” (or “authenticity”). Examples of material to which the criteria may be applied will be selected from the major areas historical of Jesus research: e.g., Jesus? relation to John the Baptist, Jesus? proclamation of the kingdom as future yet present, his realization of the kingdom through deeds of power (miracles) and table fellowship, the various levels or circles of followers (the crowds, the disciples, the Twelve), various competing groups (Pharisees, Sadducees), his teaching in relation to the Mosaic Law, the enigma (riddle-speech) of his parables, self-designation, final days, passion, and death. Rather than trying to cover large amounts of material, the emphasis will be on grasping the method of the quest, especially the understanding and application of the criteria of historicity.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40201&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christian Theological Tradition I</strong><br> This course offers a survey of Christian theology from the end of the New Testament to the eve of the Reformation (well, almost). Taking the theological idea of "Mystery" as our theme, we will acquaint ourselves with theologians or theological developments of major significance in the period covered by the survey. Thus, students will be invited to think about the character and nature of the theological task while investigating major issues, challenges, and questions at the intersection of faith and reason.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40237&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonaventure the Theologian</strong><br> St. Bonaventure is a theologian of considerable accomplishment, fully committed to the proclamation and exploration of Christian truth, and, to the living out of Christian truth, and fully adept in a variety of literary genres, both scholastic and spiritual in nature. Trinity and Christ stand at the heart of his theology and spirituality, and Bonaventure's meditations on Christ and Trinity, and the life of discipleship to the Christ who is the Word incarnate--rooted in scripture and offered in dialogue with the great early Christian writers (e.g., Augustine and Ps.-Dionysius), as well as the more recent medieval masters of the school of St. Victor--have proven to be of enduring significance. This course offers an introduction to the theology and doctrinal spirituality of Bonaventure, considering his teaching on Christ, Trinity, and discipleship, in such writings as his life of St. Francis, the Tree of Life, The Soul's Journey into God, the collations on the Hexaemeron, and the disputed questions on Christ, and, on Trinity.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40290&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Popes, Patriarchs, and Councils</strong><br> This course examines medieval theological thinking about the Church: her unity, her boundaries, the variety of cultural traditions within her, her place in the world, and the ways the Church should be structured and governed. We shall base our discussions upon the reading of the medieval Latin texts in translation from the time of the Gregorian Reform in the 11th century to the age of Conciliarism and the Pre-Reformers in the 15th century. The course will also provide an introduction into the main texts, figures and tenets of Byzantine ecclesiological thinking from the 11th century up to 1453 (about one third of the course material). We shall also explore and discuss the opportunities and challenges medieval thinking poses to contemporary ecclesiological discourse.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40294&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; U.S. Latino Catholicism</strong><br> Latina and Latino Catholics have lived their faith in what is now the United States for almost twice as long as the nation has existed. This course explores the development of Latino Catholicism in the United States, the ways Latinos are currently transforming the U.S. Catholic Church, Hispanic faith expressions related to Jesus and Mary, and especially the theological contributions of contemporary Latinas and Latinos.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40403&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Catholic Sacraments</strong><br> "Lumen Gentium" says that in the Church, "the life of Christ is poured into the believers who, through the sacraments, are united in a hidden and real way to Christ who suffered and was glorified" (7). This course will look at the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church as the means whereby Christians are mystically united to the life of Christ. Although we will use a historical framework to organize our material, the main focus of attention will be on the theological dimensions of each sacrament. This will give us the opportunity both to examine particular questions that conditioned the development of current sacramental theology, and the content of each rite as it exists today. Some attention will be paid to the nature of sacramental symbol in general, but the course's primary focus is on the sacraments as liturgical rites by which Christian life is celebrated.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40632&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heart's Desire &amp; Social Change</strong><br> Beyond financial prosperity and material gain, many people today speak about the hunger to find purpose and meaningful work that has lasting impact on society, culture, and the global community. We not only want to find lucrative employment but to discover a way of life that resonates with the deepest part of ourselves. When we experience a consistent flow between our life’s energies and our daily tasks, we are the most alive, engaged and at peace. But how can we find a way to integrate our inner and outer lives? This course will help students clarify their deepest passions in life that facilitate personal formation and social transformation. At its core it will explore the process of self-awareness and self-development that lead ultimately to self-gift. Some of the major themes we will look at include: values, spirituality, discernment, identity, true self/false self, justice, flow, freedom, Catholic Social Teaching and mission.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40714&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laudato Si in African Context</strong><br> The course introduces students to the historical, political and economic dimensions of the ecological crisis in Africa. It will also introduce students to hopeful signs and innovative models of sustainable land use, food production and economic entrepreneurship underway in some poor communities in Africa. The course is designed around Pope Francis? two central convictions in Laudato Si namely: (1) the close connection between the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor, and (2) the spiritual “wound” that lies at the heart of the ecological crisis, our inability to live as creatures made from the dust of the earth. The overall objective of the course is to help students to see the connections between the spiritual wound, the ecological crisis and poverty in Africa. It will also help students appreciate how Christian faith and theology can contribute to the healing of the wound, and in so doing inspire fresh experiments of an integrated approach, which fights poverty, protects nature and restores human dignity.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40827&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comparative Spiritualities</strong><br> This course provides a first introduction to some of the more influential spiritualities practiced by Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, and Eastern Orthodox Christians down through the ages and seeks to determine their significance for contemporary Roman Catholic spiritual praxis and theology. In order to properly understand the practices of Hindu yoga and bhakti, of Buddhist vipassana and Zen, of Muslim salat/namaz and Sufism, of the Eastern Orthodox Jesus Prayer/Hesychasm and the accompanying place of human effort in asceticism and morality, it will be necessary to examine underlying convictions about the nature of the human person and the supreme reality, of divine presence and grace, as well as the declared ultimate goal of spiritual endeavor, whether it be expressed more in terms of a communion of love or of enlightened higher consciousness. During the semester we will not only study important spiritual texts of other religions, but we will also practice meditation, visit a local mosque for Friday prayers and sermon, and be instructed by expert guest speakers who represent religious traditions other than our own.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40837&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meaning, Vulnerability and Human Existence</strong><br> This course explores how theology and literature can combine to enrich our understanding. Focusing on the work of Augustine, Aquinas, Dante, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky and Primo Levi, students will address questions such as: “How does the way we use language bear upon our notions of truth?”; “How are the intellect and the imagination engaged by literary texts?”; “How does all this relate to how we think about God, human nature, and the relationship between them?” Such questions will be addressed, in particular, by reflecting on how the texts studied invite us to think about love, forgiveness, vulnerability and creativity.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40850&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Theology of Benedict XVI</strong><br> The aim of the course to give an overview of the theology of Pope Benedict XVI, as this expressed both in his encyclicals and other recent writings, but also in his theological reflection as Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger. The course has essentially three foci. Roughly equal treatment means that each topic will receive a week of treatment. The first of the three foci concentrates on the Papal Encyclicals God is Love, Charity in Truth, Saved in Hope. The second of the three foci looks at the work of the present Pope as instructional and catechetical. Here we will concentrate on Jesus of Nazareth, God's Word, and Ten Commandments for the Environment. The third and last of our three foci concerns the Pope as a public intellectual, specifically as intervening in the public square to provide a sense of what the church has at stake in the modern world, what it can and must do in terms of dialogue, what it must do in terms of identity and continuing to be a witness. Among the texts that we will read are Truth and Tolerance, The Regensburg Lecture, and Values in a Time of Upheaval. Requirements include involvement in discussion, and either two eight page papers or one 15-page paper</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40865&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith and Reason</strong><br> This course is offered as an introduction to the problem of the relation between faith and reason. Figures to be read include Augustine, Anselm, Thomas Aquinas, Descartes, Hume, Kant, Kierkegaard, Newman, and Dostoevsky.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40872&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intro to Latino Theology</strong><br> This course examines the method and practice of Latino Theology, a theology that takes as its starting point the everyday, communal, and liberating experience of faith of the Hispanic people of God in the United States. We will explore the contributions made by Latinos to all the major theological loci (God, Christology, Ecclesiology, etc.) and also the dialogues with non-Latino and non-Christian perspectives that have enriched the theory and practice of Latino theology.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO40873&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercy and Liberation</strong><br> This course offers an introduction to Latin American Liberation Theology through the lens of the theme of mercy. After an initial introduction to the context, origins, and aims of liberation theology, the course will treat the theme of mercy in classical and liberationist texts, attending to points of continuity and development throughout. A central aim of the course is to help students reflect upon doing theology in way that is rooted in the Christian theological tradition and responsive to contemporary challenges.</p> 
     <p><strong>THEO45001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research Apprenticeship</strong><br> In this one-credit course, students will work as research apprentices with a particular faculty member on specific research projects.</p>
