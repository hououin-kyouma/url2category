        </div>OU KNOW HOW GOOD you are, but do you know how good you could be? 
        <br>
        <br>This is a case where it’s easy to think that good is good enough and get comfortable. Most of us live below our potential. As a result, we miss out on opportunities and therefore live below our true potential and hinder our ability to contribute to others. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780718093143.html" title="Potential Principle"><i>The Potential Principle</i></a> by Mark Sanborn is about how we can become better – even better than our best selves. It’s not about perfect. It’s about better. 
        <br>
        <br>So you might ask, “Better at what?” Sanborn presents a program to get you on the road to better. First, you need to figure out just what you want to improve. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>What Do You Want to Improve?</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>Your journey toward better can be 
        <b>organized into four areas</b>: Performing, Learning, Reflecting, and Thinking. 
        <br>
        <br>Improvement happens by not only things you initiate like interactive, collaborative activities but also by responding to what you hear, observe, learn as represented by the 
        <b><i>vertical</i></b> line. Improvement also takes place in both our inner (things going on inside us) and our outer (things going with others) worlds as represented by the 
        <b><i>horizontal</i></b> line. It’s about the inner world of being versus the outer world of performing. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/PotentialMap.gif" width="500" height="300" alt="Potential Matrix"> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Performing</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>The top right quadrant is the most familiar to us. “It’s where most of us consciously spend each day doing things: the observable world of initiating, acting, and producing.” It’s what people expect of us when we show up – results. It takes 
        <b>deliberate practice</b>. Performance improvement is not a straight line. There are plateaus. Also, keep in mind the 
        <b><i>FIT model</i></b>: Frequency, Intensity, and Technique. How often you practice, the intensity you bring to it and the techniques you use, make all the difference. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Learning</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>Learning involves the acquisition of new ideas that we put into practice. If we approach life humbly, we will be enriched by what we do not know. Intentional curiosity keeps us growing. “Develop a learning agenda.” Identify what you must or need to learn and then make the time and find the resources to do it. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Reflecting</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>Reflecting is the inner world of responding. This is an underappreciated value in our instant, tech driven world. It’s about waiting and listening. “Epiphanies—that is, clarity and deeper understanding about yourself and how to improve your life—happen through introspection.” It’s easy to think that we have no time for this and focus on the outer world of doing, but, says Sanborn, “
        <b>the inner world informs the outer world</b>, and that for the majority of us, going within to understand motivations, hopes fears, and dreams offers some of the greatest leverage to improving every area of our lives.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Thinking</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>Think about thinking. “Thinking is about proactively contemplating the world around you. It’s the source of vision, dreams, plans, and strategies. It uses external input and creates connections and directions.” Make the time to think about what you need to learn and unlearn. Focus your thinking and write it down. “
        <b>Some of the biggest payoffs from thinking will occur when you review notes of previous thinking sessions and add to or modify what you came up with.</b>” 
        <br>
        <br>Sanborn explains each of these areas in more detail to help you develop the 
        <b>right mindset</b>. Improvement in these four areas are key to improving consistently. 
        <br>
        <br>To be sure, each of us is more comfortable on one or two of these areas. If you are not spending enough time in an area, that will signal an area where you could improve. “Each area complements the others. If you are headed toward better, you’ll want to use each of the four areas identified. Doing so will help you reach your destination sooner and, perhaps more important, enrich the trip.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Four Tools for Breakthrough Improvement</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>These four tools will help you “prevent complacency, create improvement, and bust through barriers” on your improvement journey. 
        <ol>
         <li><b>Disrupt Yourself</b> <i>(before someone else does)</i> <br>“Unwillingness to confront assumptions, challenge your thinking, and try new things is a roadblock to improvement.” It’s proactive rather than reactive. Ask disruptive questions like: “What is the most important lesson I’ve learned this past year? What am I doing out of habit that doesn’t serve me well?</li> 
         <li><b>(re)Focus</b> <br>“Distraction impedes getting better.”</li> 
         <li><b>Engage Others</b> <br>“Self-responsibility is the primary step toward a successful life. But engaging others and building mutually beneficial relationships will leverage everything you do.” Solicit advice, ideas, and counsel.</li> 
         <li><b>Expand Your Capacity</b> <br>There’s room for more. Time x Effort = Capacity. “What one or two skills, if fully developed and consistently deployed, would make the biggest difference in your personal and professional improvement?”</li>
        </ol> 
        <br>The ideas you will find in 
        <a href="https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780718093143.html" title="Potential Principle"><i>The Potential Principle</i></a> are not all new, but they are 
        <b>organized</b> in such a way as to make them 
        <b>actionable</b>. Sanborn has done a great job of laying the foundation and providing a blueprint for continuous improvement. All you need to do now is to put it into practice.

        </div>E ALL have mood swings. 
        <br>
        <br>But once we accept the fact that moods aren’t something that happen to us, but are 
        <b>the result of our thinking</b>, we can do something to control them—or at least manage them better. 
        <br>
        <br>Senn Delaney, Chairman and founder of Senn Delaney, wrote 
        <a href="https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781523084616.html" title="Mood Elevator"><i>The Mood Elevator</i></a> to help us take charge of our emotions and control our rides on the Mood Elevator. 
        <br>
        <br>Step one is understanding that the way we respond to outside events depends on what is happening inside our heads. “There may be events that stimulate our thoughts, but it is the thoughts that determine our moods.” Reality is reality; it’s what we make of it that makes a difference in our lives. 
        <blockquote>
         You will never let go of your moods completely, but knowing that hour thoughts are the source of those moods can provide a little added distance and help you remain in control. It’s a powerful first step to learning to ride up the Mood Elevator rather than feeling like a helpless victim of emotional forces you can’t control.
        </blockquote> 
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Why Does It Matter?</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>When we are down the Mood Elevator our thinking is closed. When we travel up the Mood Elevator our thinking improves and opens up. We can reconnect with our best self. 
        <blockquote>
         We all come into this world with the potential for mental and emotional health. Our natural state is to be loving, creative, trusting, forgiving, curious, happy, and desirous of warm, close relationships with others. Unfortunately, as we grow up most of us develop thought habits or beliefs that can mask or obscure our innate health. At some point we are hurt by someone, and we may become guarded and defensive. We are criticized for a mistake, and we may earn to make excuses and blame others, seeking to become less accountable so we don’t look bad.
        </blockquote> 
        <br>
        <img src="https://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/MoodElevatorChart.gif" width="190" height="308" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="Mood Elevator">When we are up the Mood Elevator it is easier to maintain our sense of perspective and keep our cool in times of difficulty, stress, or conflict. Traveling up the Mood Elevator we are more ready to access the sources of original ideas. 
        <br>
        <br>Unfortunately, 
        <b>we can become stuck</b> so long on the lower floors of the Mood Elevator that we can begin to think that it’s normal. Recognize when you are staying on the lower-floor emotions. Although it doesn’t make us happy, we can actually grow comfortable with self-destructive patterns of thought, negative thinking and victimization. So we feed these thinking patterns and reinforce them with stories told to validate our perspective on life. Other people are often motivated by the same things we are. It’s just that their perspective is different than ours. It’s best for us if we let it go. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>How to Move Up the Mood Elevator</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>The dividing line is 
        <b>curiosity</b> because when something happens that threatens to pull you down to the lower floors, you can stop yourself and ask, “I wonder why they did that? It would be interesting to find out.” We tend to rush to the judgmental/blaming floor but with a curious perspective you can begin to move up to the higher floors. 
        <br>
        <br>Learn to interrupt your own mood patterns and typical responses. A good night’s sleep, exercise, deep breathing, positive self-talk, and even listen to your favorite music can all help in this regard. 
        <br>
        <br>Adapt an attitude of 
        <b><i>mild preference</i></b>. Senn explains: 
        <blockquote>
         Living in mild preference doesn’t mean adopting a Pollyanna attitude. It does mean looking for positive steps you can take to solve problems when they arise—and refusing to wallow in the emotions of frustration and anger that problems can so easily generate. Living in mild preference does not mean having no standards or principles. It does mean being selective about how and when to apply your standards and principles—choosing your battels carefully, as the saying goes.
        </blockquote> 
        <br>Naturally a 
        <b>sense of humor</b> and 
        <b>humility</b> help here. But at the top of the Mood Elevator you will find 
        <b>gratefulness</b>. Senn calls it the overriding emotion. “It’s almost impossible to be grateful and at the same time be angry, depressed, irritated, or self-righteous.” Gratitude is a good way to maintain a healthy perspective on what’s happening in your life. “Focus on activities that will nourish your sense of gratitude and your appreciation for the blessings you’ve already been granted.”. 
        <br>
        <br>A few other important thoughts to help us manage our moods: 
        <blockquote>
         Recognize and honor separate realties we all live in. Be quick to understand other’s perspectives and slow to blame or criticize. 
         <br>
         <br>Remember that your thinking is unreliable in the lower mood states, so delay important conversations and decisions; don’t act on your unreliable thinking, and don’t take your lower mood state out on other people. 
         <br>
         <br>Have faith when you are down on the Mood Elevator, that this too shall pass.

        </div>E LIVE in an age of noise. Getting some time for yourself is a challenge. But if we are going to lead effectively, we need white space. We need solitude. 
        <br>
        <br>I know none of us have any extra time, but there is overwhelming evidence that taking a time-out to simply think is foundational to your success. 
        <br>
        <br>Raymond Kethledge and Michael Erwin explore some solid reasons why you must make the time to think in 
        <a href="https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781632866318.html" title="Innovation Code"><i>Lead Yourself First</i></a>. 
        <br>
        <br>When we say solitude we mean a “
        <b>subjective state of mind, in which the mind, isolated from input from other minds, works through a problem on its own</b>.” There is no particular structure to it—place, time, or length—but it must focus the mind. It’s scheduled white space—a commitment you make to yourself simply because your leadership begins with who you are—not what you do. 
        <br>
        <br>So let’s look at 
        <b>four things solitude will do for you</b>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Clarity</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>Clarity is about what is true. What is signal and what is noise? Solitude facilitates that distillation process. It helps you to eliminate or deliberately deemphasize all distractions. That alone will help you to make the time to think. Clarity and focus go hand-in-hand. That kind of focused attention is often best done alone. 
        <br>
        <br>Intuition complements analytical thought. When we get stuck, “intuition can provide clarity when analytical thinking cannot.” The challenge is accessing it. Accessing intuition requires “a deeper form of solitude: an absence of inputs not only from other minds, but also from one’s own.” 
        <br>
        <br>Clarity is important for decision-making but it is also critical for understanding who you are—strengths and weaknesses. It helps to connect you with your core values and understand your place from that perspective. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Creativity</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>Solitude opens the path to creativity. Solitude isn’t always the shortest distance to the goal. Joey Reiman, CEO of the consulting firm BrightHouse, credits their success to their “longer, incubation pace.” On one project he says, “If we had moved at a faster, business pace, we never would have excavated that original brand identity and then generalized it into a new ethos.” 
        <br>
        <br>Dena Braeger, mother of six in El Paso, offered this insight into information overload: 
        <blockquote>
         People make such an effort to copy what other people do, because we have so much access to information. I’m surrounded by people on Pinterest. I’ll be dammed if I make something on Pinterest. You’ll see things like these cupcakes that look amazing. And people copy them. But on the inside their phony, because the person didn’t create it themselves. 
         <b>We’re getting more of everything, but less of what is authentically ourselves.</b> If we spent more time alone, creating something that might not look as amazing but is more authentic, we’d value ourselves more.
        </blockquote> 
        <br>Creativity is doing something differently than the norm. Solitude allows us to get away from the inertia of our environment and connect to new possibilities. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Emotional Balance</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>Emotional balance requires you to respond rather than react. General James Mattis finds 
        <b>a lack of reflection the single biggest problem facing leaders</b>. “The leader who neglects to step out of the sweep of events, to contemplate from whence they come and where they might go. Finds himself merely blown from one thing to another. But 
        <b>the leader who steps outside events is a leader who can change them</b>.” 
        <br>
        <br>Solitude allows you to reflect on what is making you emotional and provide clarity on the issue. Often what you are emotional about is more of a distraction than an issue. Again Dena Braeger, the West Point graduate and mother of six in El Paso, said, “When I’m practicing solitude regularly, I self-correct so much better. I’m more focused on what’s important, and I let things go that aren’t important.” 
        <br>
        <br>Instead of allowing our emotions to adversely affect our leadership, it is wise to move away and deal with them in private. Our emotions will find an outlet somewhere. And that is best alone than in decisions made through unfiltered emotions that affect those around us. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Moral Courage</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>We’ve all seen them: leaders who take themselves too seriously—who believe their own press release. And it’s all too easy for any of us to fall prey to self-admiration. “
        <b>Honest reflation can deflate these pretentions.</b>” Reflection can pave the way to humility. 
        <br>
        <br>Solitude allows you to slow down and be clear and firmly convicted of your values and beliefs. “Leaders who are well anchored in what they believe are going to be more effective,” says Doug Conant, the former CEO and president of the Campbell Soup Company. When those criticisms come along that are design to enforce conformity, it is easier to weather the storm when you know that what you are doing is the right thing to do for the right reasons. It is the power to rise above. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Reclaiming Solitude</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>Brené Brown, author of Daring Greatly, says that “
        <b>The biggest mistake I’ve made in my career to date is believing that solitude is a luxury.</b> I could chart the ups and downs of my quality of life personally and professionally and the amount of time I spend in solitude.” As important as it is, it is easy to let it slip away without even realizing it. We are continuously bombarded by pressures—
        <i>both personal and social</i>—not to stop and reflect but if we lose our solitude, we will lose who we are. 
        <br>
        <br>You don’t have to go off to a mountaintop or sit at the seashore. It can be a closed room, the library, a park bench, and even a waiting room. 
        <br>
        <br>We have a responsibility to seek out periods of solitude. We owe it to ourselves and those we lead.

        </div>NOWING how to work with and relate to people is an imperative. Relationship building is critical for anyone wishing to rise to any position of leadership. The guidelines for achievement are many. Here are five ideas you might be able to start using today: 
        <ol>
         <li><b>Avoid becoming an antagonist.</b> Antagonism doesn’t build friends. It is acceptable to disagree on an issue. But reaching the level of adversary builds resistance to you and your ideas. Learn to disagree in a professional manner. You can have strong support for your belief without antagonizing. (A little patience goes a long way here). It may be surprising to you that the strategy works more often than not. And, in the long term, it enhances your ability to influence.<br><br></li> 
         <li><b>Always thank anyone who helps, even in the slightest way.</b> Even small events deserve a sincere round of thanks. People appreciate appreciation and “thank you” does exactly that. This is especially important for the people that work under your leadership. Never miss an opportunity to express sincere thanks for a job well done. Go the extra mile and send a hand written note expressing your appreciation. Doing so separates you from others who are not as considerate and appreciative for the help of others. Stand Out! Write!<br><br></li> 
         <li><b>Treat everyone you meet well.</b> What I’m saying here is have a genuine respect for those you meet. Starting from that position moves the relationship in a positive direction. Business owners (leaders) need to greet customers in this manner. Doing so is the first step to creating an atmosphere for long-term customer relations. Showing respect builds trust of the leader. Couple that with a genuine desire to serve and you make leadership a successful practice.<br><br></li> 
         <li><b>Build your speaking skills and you will build your people skills.</b> Words are powerful tools. Become masters of conversation and you enhance your ability to lead. Delivering messages with great clarity and understanding builds followers, a necessary component of leadership. Delivering words with passion and believability can influence, another important quality of a leader. But, let’s not forget another important part of communication, listening. Learn how to speak well and give equal importance to learning how to listen well.<br><br></li> 
         <li><b>Conflict is more likely to get resolved with calmness than with any other method.</b> Staying calm disarms conflict. Echoing their emotions is a catalyst for a fight. It’s difficult to argue with or fight calmness. <br><br>A manager once approached me in an agitated manner. I had scheduled a safety training for his department. I assumed, as a new safety manager, that I just scheduled training and people attended. My mistake was not checking with him to verify if my proposed schedule worked for his employees. Instead of arguing or disagreeing, I realized I had made a mistake and apologized. He stopped in his tracks. And, with a confused look on his face, lost his hostility and words. I told him I would work with him to reschedule this training. In the future, I would work with him when offering other training. This calm approach disarmed him and he walked away without a word.</li>

        </div>MART used to be a 
        <b><i>quantity</i></b> game. “I know more than you. I get more things right.” But Ed Hess and Katherine Ludwig say that in the new Smart Machine Age, that’s losing game. The new smart is about 
        <b><i>quality</i></b>. Specifically, the quality of your thinking, your listening, and your relating and collaborative skills. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Are you ready?</b> 
        <br>
        <br>The Smart Machine Age (SMA) will revolutionize how most of us live and work. In 
        <a href="https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781626568754.html" title="Humility is the New Smart"><i>Humility is the New Smart</i></a>, the authors state that “smart technologies will become ubiquitous, invading and changing many aspects of our professional and personal lives and in many ways challenging our fundamental beliefs about success, opportunity, and the American Dream.” This means that the “number and types of available jobs and required skills will turn our lives and our children’s lives upside down.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>New skills will be needed. Uniquely human skills.</b> Those skills, while uniquely human, are not what we are typically trained to do and require a deal of messy personal development. We will need to become better thinkers, listeners, relators, and collaborators, while working to overcome our culture of obsessive individualism in order to thrive in the SMA. Humility is the mindset that will make all of this possible. 
        <blockquote>
         Most of today’s adults have had no formal training in how to think, how to listen, how to learn and experiment through inquiry, how to emotionally engage, how to manage emotions, how to collaborate, or how to embrace mistakes as learning opportunities.
        </blockquote> 
        <br>In short, say the authors, we need to acquire and continually develop 
        <b>four fundamental NewSmart behaviors</b>: 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Quieting Ego</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>Quieting Ego has always been the challenge for us humans. As they observe, “Even if we don’t consider ourselves part of the ‘big me’ cultural phenomenon, for many of us to feel good about ourselves we have to constantly be ‘right,’ self-enhance, self-promote, and conceal our weaknesses, all of which drive ego defensiveness and failure intolerance that impedes higher-level thinking and relating.” This tendency negatively affects our behavior, thinking, and ability to relate to and engage with others. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Managing Self—Thinking and Emotions</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>We need to get above ourselves to see ourselves impartially. 
        <b>We all struggle “to self-regulate our basic humanity</b>—our biases, fears, insecurities, and natural fight-flee-or-freeze response to stress and anxiety.” We need to be willing to treat all of our “beliefs (not values) as hypotheses subject to stress tests and modification by better data.” 
        <br>
        <br>Negative emotions cause narrow-mindedness. Positive emotions on the other hand, have been scientifically linked to “broader attention, open-mindedness, deeper focus, and more flexible thinking, all of which underlie creativity and innovative thinking.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Reflective Listening</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>Because we are limited by our own thinking, we need to listen to others to “open our minds and, push past our biases and mental models, and mitigate self-absorption in order to collaborate and build better relationships.” The problem is “we’re just too wired to confirm what we already believe, and we feel too comfortable having a cohesive simple story of how our world works.” Listening to others helps to quiet our ego. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Otherness</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>To create these new behaviors and mindsets, it should become obvious that we need to enlist the help of others. “We can’t think, innovate, or relate at our best alone.” As Barbara Fredrickson observed, “
        <b>nobody reaches his or her full potential in isolation</b>.” Jane Dutton out it this way: “It seems to be another fact that no man can come to know himself except as the outcome of disclosing himself to another.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>The NewSmart Organization</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>Optimal human performance in the SMA will require an emphasis on the emotional aspects of critical thinking, creativity, innovation and engaging with others. “
        <b>The work environment must be designed to reduce fears, insecurities, and other negative emotions.</b>” 
        <br>
        <br>To do this it means “providing people a feeling of being respected, held in positive regard, and listened to. It means creating opportunities for people to connect and build trust. “It means allocating time and designing work environments that bring people together to relate about nonwork matters.” Finally, it means getting to know employees and helping them to get the “right training or opportunities to develop and provide feedback.” 
        <br>
        <br>The NewSmart organization needs to be a safe place to learn. “Feeling safe means that you feel that your boss your employer, and your colleagues will do you no harm as you try to learn.”

        </div>HE GAP IN OUR LEADERSHIP arises as a result of the disconnect between how we think people are experiencing our leadership and how they are actually experiencing our leadership. And where we find that disconnect we limit or even derail our leadership potential. 
        <br>
        <br>In 
        <a href="https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781101981351.html" title="Leadership Gap"><i>The Leadership Gap</i></a>, Lolly Daskal addresses this gap—what it is, why it happens, and what we can do about it. The gap is always there but at some point it comes the surface to sabotage us. What if we don’t know what we think we know? 
        <blockquote>
         The problem is that one day, suddenly, what once worked so well to propel their rise stops working. And the very same traits that had worked for them actually start working against them.
        </blockquote> It is at this point that we need to begin asking ourselves some questions. “What is the gap between who I am and who I want to be, and do I know what it is I still need to learn?” In short, “Who am I being?” We need to rethink how our behaviors are perceived by those around us. And when there is that gap between how we want to be perceived and how we are actually being perceived, we need to take action. 
        <b>“Learning to recognize your leadership gap is the factor that determines your greatness as a leader.”</b> Sometimes we overuse a strength and sometimes we drift into the shadow side of our strengths. Either way, an understanding of what drives can give us the insight we need to avoid our leadership gaps. 
        <br>
        <br>Daskal invites us to look at who we are being and the instincts that drive our behaviors. The “shadow” you. She has developed seven leadership architypes to help us gain some clarity as to what drives our beliefs and therefore our behaviors. We aren’t necessarily one type as we tend to shift from one to another depending on the circumstances but “we tend to lean repeatedly toward the same archetype persona.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>The Seven Archetypes</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="https://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/Daskal-Rebel.png" width="112" height="75" align="left" alt="rebel">
        <b>The Rebel</b> who is driven by confidence. 
        <i>“How can I push the envelope?”</i> The gap is self-doubt. The gap architype is 
        <b>The Imposter</b> who is so insecure they play havoc with their mind because they have self-doubt. The key to the Rebel’s success is confidence, but self-doubt that often accompanies great success, undermines their confidence and they act out of the imposter syndrome. They undermine their leadership thus keeping them from achieving greatness. 
        <br>
        <br> 
        <img src="https://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/Daskal-Explorer.png" width="112" height="75" align="left" alt="explorer">
        <b>The Explorer</b> who is fueled by intuition. 
        <i>“What can I discover?”</i> The gap is manipulation. The gap architype is 
        <b>The Exploiter</b> who manipulates every chance they get just so you will not know how powerless they really feel. The tendency for the Explorer is to use their intuition to manipulate others to gain control. Daskal notes, “Whereas intuition makes things better for others, manipulation is always about making things better for you.” 
        <br>
        <br> 
        <img src="https://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/Daskal-Truth.png" width="112" height="75" align="left" alt="truth">
        <b>The Truth Teller</b> who embraces candor. 
        <i>“Where should I speak up?”</i> The gap is suspicion. The gap architype is 
        <b>The Deceiver</b> who is suspicious about everyone because they cannot trust themselves to speak the truth. Discovering the truth and then speaking up for what is right is never easy but when we find we have been deceived, we can become paranoid and suspicious of others undermining our influence. We can become a kind of victim that will not speak up when we need to because of our paranoia. 
        <br>
        <br> 
        <img src="https://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/Daskal-Hero.png" width="112" height="90" align="left" alt="hero">
        <b>The Hero</b> who embodies courage. 
        <i>“Where is courage needed?”</i> The gap is fear. The gap architype is 
        <b>The Bystander</b> who is too fearful to be brave, too conservative to take a risk, and too cautious to take a stand. Once enabled by courage, they are now sidelined by fear. “Most of us not really afraid of being brave—we are afraid of what it takes to be brave. We are not really afraid of losing everything—we are afraid of what will happen when we have nothing.” 
        <br>
        <br> 
        <img src="https://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/Daskal-Inventor.png" width="112" height="90" align="left" alt="inventor">
        <b>The Inventor</b> who is brimming with integrity. 
        <i>“How can we make this better?”</i> No matter what you do you will be “held accountable and responsible as people. Everything in business, leadership, and success is founded on the virtue of integrity—it is the force that leads the way.” The gap is corruption. The gap archetype is 
        <b>The Destroyer</b> who is morally corrupt. While an Inventor puts their personal values into practice, if those values become corrupted, usually by forces such as ego, personal gain, or anger, they destroy the organization from within. The Destroyer advocates cutting corners, quick fixes and compromising quality and standards. “The Inventor maintains his or her integrity while thinking outside the box.” 
        <br>
        <br> 
        <img src="https://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/Daskal-Navigator.png" width="112" height="108" align="left" alt="navigator">
        <b>The Navigator</b> who trusts and is trusted as they guide people to where they need to go. 
        <i>“How can we get to where we need to go?”</i> The gap is arrogance. The gap architype is 
        <b>The Fixer</b> who a chronic rescuer no one trusts They want to help too much, fix too much and rescue too much. “Navigators have a way of making the complicated simple, and the simple understandable. They inspire trust. But their ability and confidence to know where to go and become an arrogance that attempt to control others—to do for others what they need to be doing themselves. 
        <br>
        <br> 
        <img src="https://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/Daskal-Knight.png" width="112" height="85" align="left" alt="knight">
        <b>The Knight</b> for whom loyalty is everything and will stand beside you and will serve you before they serve themselves. 
        <i>“How can I serve you?”</i> The gap is self-serving. The gap architype is 
        <b>The Mercenary</b> who is self -serving and put their own needs before those of the team, the business or the organization. Often the transition from serving to self-serving is subtle. “Loyal employees become disloyal one infraction at a time. Only after unfaithfulness shapes itself does the self-serving attitude emerge in a way it can be detected and deciphered.” 
        <br>
        <br>Daskal reminds us that understanding our weaknesses is our greatest strength. From these seven architypes we can see how each has powerful abilities and hidden impediments. By knowing the gaps we can get into we can better use our strengths to achieve our own leadership greatness. 
        <br>
        <br>Daskal explains each of these architypes in detail and importantly how we avoid these gaps. She describes what the positive looks like and what the negative looks like with examples for each. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781101981351.html" title="Leadership Gap"><i>The Leadership Gap</i></a> provides the antidote for leading on autopilot. Daskal provides the insight into our behaviors and beliefs that can if not managed properly can derail even the most talented and successful leaders. Confronting and avoiding our leadership gaps is the key to attaining long-term leadership success.

        </div>WO OF THE TOP top coaches of our time, Alan Weiss and Marshall Goldsmith, have come together to write a book about how to grow into possibility—your unique possibility. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781119366126.html" title="Lifestorming"><i>Lifestorming: Creating Meaning and Achievement in Your Career and Life</i></a> presents life as a journey without a “there.” An evolutionary journey through life. The goal for each of us is to take on life and enjoy it immensely by developing the required character and engaging in it enormously. 
        <br>
        <br>As we go through life, “people skills are usually the key differentiators of success.” It is imperative that we work on ourselves. We begin by understanding where we are and then where we want to be. “The fundamental work of changing our behavior for the better is ultimately our own responsibility.” 
        <br>
        <br>Going it alone is not easy and not the most effective way to implement major changes. We need a coach—or someone in our life that can act as a coach—because we need accountability and frankly, all too often, we don’t know what it is we really need to change. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Replace Poor Behaviors</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>When thinking about change, our strategy needs to be not to change poor behavior but to replace it. We cling to poor behaviors because we get something from it. Even in the midst of painful consequences we can find some comfort in reproducing old ways of thinking. So, we need to find a positive, constructive behavior to replace the negative behavior that is currently generating the reward we seek without all of the collateral damage.. “We often engage in behavior for no other reason than that we’ve never examined alternatives.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Challenge Your Beliefs</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>If we can get to the beliefs behind our actions we can better regulate our behaviors. It’s important to remember too, that “we aren’t in a snapshot; we’re part of a film. We deal with what is today, knowing that it shouldn’t necessarily be what is tomorrow.” 
        <br>
        <br>Beliefs form attitudes which in turn create behaviors. “Attitudes are the connectors—the synapses—between beliefs and behavior, a self-comforting way of thinking or feeling about someone or something, typically reflected in a person’s behavior.” Everything we do comes from how we look at life—our personal reality. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Remaining Faithful to Our Growth Plan</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>We need to create a support system and we are responsible for creating our own support system. As a journey, we need to understand that behavior is more important than victories. “If you engage in consistently correct behavior, you’ll be successful.” Seek excellence, not perfection. “Once you’re content with excellence, you’ll improve daily and will act daily with alacrity and intent.” And learn when to fold and when to hold. “There is a time when you cannot change things, they will not get better on their own, and you need to take a sharp right turn to escape your predicament.” They caution: “If we don’t accept the things we can’t change, we’ll forever be stressed and unhealthy.” 
        <br>
        <br>A growth journey is not always easy and there will be obstacles. “Achieving success does not immediately or automatically make life easier. Instead, it usually creates new challenges—often ones we didn’t anticipate.” 
        <br>
        <br>“We know that whatever fate delivers, we have some agency—even if it’s only in how we react.” We need to stay in control of ourselves and only take prudent risks. For example, don’t gamble with finances, time, health, or relationships. 
        <br>
        <br>As we grow, a spirit of generosity will help us to keep from backsliding. A scarcity mindset weakens and limits us. We must expand our view. “We have to think differently and think bigger. Instead of extrapolating from where we are today and looking at arithmetic growth, we must paint a picture of the future and decide how to achieve it through geometric growth. Our journey is a moving target.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Lifestorming</i> addresses the pitfalls of growth and the traps we fall into—like the need to be right. You will find a complete and effective plan to guide you on your own growth journey. The authors also share their own personal stories for encouragement.

        </div>UMILITY IS A CHOICE. When you meet a humble person you know you will be accepted, respected and listened to. They won’t try to manipulate you, control you, criticize you or try to impress you. They are safe. 
        <br>
        <br>When we haven’t conquered our pride putting on false humility might seem like the shortcut to the benefits of being a truly humble person. We’ve all met these kinds of people. False humility is nothing but arrogance. 
        <br>
        <br>In 
        <a href="http://amzn.to/2oOnTLx"><i>Humility: The Secret Ingredient of Success</i></a>, Pat Williams, author and senior vice president of the NBA’s Orlando Magic, suggests four ways we can avoid the mask of false humility. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>1. Take time to reflect on the person you are—and the person you want to be.</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>If we are genuinely humble, we are keenly aware of the disparity between who we are and who we aspire to be. We recognize that we have not already arrived, in terms of our character, integrity, and accomplishments. We are works in progress. 
        <br>
        <br>We need to remember that it’s easy over time to become someone we really don’t want to be. Williams cites Stanford professor Roderick Kramer: 
        <blockquote>
         When I ask respondents to explain why they think the process of experiencing great success will not change them in any fundamental way, they typically say something along the lines of, “Because I know what kind of person I am”….It is as if in finding success they will become merely bigger and better versions of what they are now. They can’t even imagine that they could ever fall from grace. And that, of course, guarantees that some of them will.
        </blockquote> 
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>2. Ask a few trusted friends to be brutally honest with you.</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>We all need people in our lives who will hold up a mirror and show us who we truly are so we won’t be walking around with the moral equivalent of spinach in our teeth. Truth is a powerful antidote to self-deception and false humility. If you always have people in your life who will tell you the truth for your own good, and if you humbly need their wise counsel, they will save you from a multitude of self-inflicted wounds. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>3. Immediately and humbly admit your faults and failures.</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>In other words, apologize without delay. Anyone who tries to achieve anything is bound to make mistakes. The greater your goals, the bigger your potential blunders. Our natural tendency is to deny our failings and shortcomings. We don’t like to admit that we’ve messed up. We prefer to protect our pride and our egos. 
        <br>
        <br>If you want to recover from a moral failure or a lapse in judgment, the key is o apologize fully, specifically, and humbly. Don’t try to get away with a non-apology apology. Be sincere. Take your lumps. Learn your lessons. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>4. Be honestly humble and humbly honest.</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>Don’t inflate your resume—but don’t deflate it either. It’s perfectly wise and acceptable to own yur achievements and state your qualifications. Just don’t brag or take more credit than you’ve earned. 
        <br>
        <br>There’s never any need for false modesty. False modesty tends to break down authentic humility because it becomes hard to know where your real humility leaves off and your phony humility begins. Yu become so accustomed to devaluing your own talent, accomplishments, and self-worth that you actually lose confidence in yourself. Yu stop speaking up, stop advocating for what you believe, stop pursuing your own goals. In short, you start believing your own self-depreciating falsehoods. 
        <br>
        <br>Genuine humility is the best policy. False modesty comes from ego and pride. As Canadian humorist Eric Nicol observed, “I am keenly aware of the need to avoid false modesty. Which, like false teeth, can make you talk funny.”

        </div>N HIS BOOK 
        <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780062457226.html" title="Stretch"><i>Stretch</i></a>, Scott Sonenshein dispels the notion that having 
        <b>more resources = getting better results</b> and replaces it with the conviction that a 
        <b>better use of resources = getting better results</b>. 
        <br>
        <br>We are under more pressure than ever to do more. The idea that we can stretch and do more with what we already have begins to remove us from the dehumanizing rat race for resources that is impossible to win. Chasing limits us. Stretch liberates. 
        <br>
        <br>Especially in uncertain times, “stretching equips us with the abilities to adapt and change when facing a less predictable set of circumstances.” 
        <br>
        <br>One of the reasons we chase instead of stretch is because fail to see how we might see a resources beyond its traditional use. It’s also easy to assume that if we just had more money we could spend our way out of our problems. It’s often easier to acquire things than to think about how to use those same resources in more productive ways. “The problem is that chasers become so fixated on acquiring resources that they lose sight of what those resources will do for them” so we end up squandering them. 
        <br>
        <br>We need to place more focus on what we already have. “Stretchers find beauty and richness in places where others struggle to see anything of value. Too often, we understand, interact with, and use things at face value, locking ourselves into conventions that limit possibilities.” Our creativity is sparked by constraints. Filmmaker Robert Rodrigues comments: 
        <blockquote>
         The creative person with limitless imagination and no money can make a better film than the talentless mogul with the limitless checkbook every time. Take advantage of your disadvantages, feature the few assets you may have, and work harder than anyone else around you.
        </blockquote> Outsiders can often stretch by seeing possibilities that we can’t because we are the expert or just too close to the issue. “Breadth of experiences helps people stretch.” The well rounded often outperform those who are deeply focused on a single thing especially when trying to solve complex problems. It makes a case for a liberal arts education. 
        <br>
        <br>We need to repeatedly go outside ourselves. “Temporary departures from our small worlds can come from short bursts of new activities such as reading about another field, finding a hobby, or having conversations with people from different backgrounds.” 
        <br>
        <br>Stretching is not about being a cheapskate. There is a difference between frugal and cheap. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>A Stretching Roadmap</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>In summary, here are a dozen ways Sonenshein suggests to help get us into the stretching habit. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Just Say No</b></font>
        <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/Stretching12Ways.jpg" width="200" height="268" align="right" alt="Stretching"> 
        <br>Just say no to more resources. Ask: “If I only didn’t have these resources, I could…” “By saying no to more resources, we’re saying yes to an entirely new outlook on working and living.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Find a Sleeping Beauty</b></font> 
        <br>It’s easy to miss what is right before us. Again an outsider can help here. “In the world beyond fairy tales, a lot of resources lie dormant. If we look hard enough, we’ll find resources all around us waiting to be activated. We just need to awaken them to benefit from more than we thought we had, allowing us to solve different problems and pursue promising opportunities that otherwise might be impossible.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Go Explore</b></font> 
        <br>Dedicate time every week to reading something different, educate yourself outside of your industry, take lunch with someone new, or spend time with outsiders. Leave your comfort zone. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Take a Break (and Pay Less Attention)</b></font> 
        <br>Consider rotating between difficult work and mindless work. “Mindless work recharges our batteries, readies us to do more down the road, and lets our mind wander to find new connections among our resources.” Take a walk to find new connections. Consider putting yourself on the clock to provide a mandatory beginning and ending to your work. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Pick New Neighbors</b></font> 
        <br>“Whom we spend time with shapes a lot of our behavior.” You don’t need to change zip codes. “Instead, identify one stretcher you admire and already know. Commit to spending at least one hour with him or her once a month.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Appreciate</b></font> 
        <br>“When people are grateful, they expand how they think about resources, often in ways that try to help others.” Also, by appreciating what we have, it makes it easier to say no to tempting things we lack but really don’t need. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Shop Your Closet</b></font> 
        <br>Use what you have. “Many of the best known inventions came from existing products. Play-Doh started as a wallpaper cleaning compound that became obsolete with the rise of vinyl wallpaper in the 1950s; the corkscrew came from a military tool to remove bullets; and Pyrex came from material from train lantern glass the wife of a scientist at Corning Glass Work experimented with to bake a cake.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Plan Backward</b></font> 
        <br>Think improvisation. Without a plan is often difficult to get started. But “jazz music replaces a plan with improvisation, teaching us to act and respond more spontaneously. Once we get moving, we free ourselves from worrying about plotting and following a plan and focus on observing and learning from our actions.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Scramble the Back Row</b></font> 
        <br>To remove chess players from entrenched thinking, Bobby Fischer suggested randomly scrambling the back row. “If we find ourselves too regularly on autopilot, it might be time to scramble our back rows. There’s comfort in habits, but it’s critical to avoid being complacent with how things are, closing off the possibility of imagining how things might be better.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Make Midyear Resolutions</b></font> 
        <br>“Why wait until the beginning of the year to make a pledge. The midyear resolutions also allow us to take stock of how we did with our New Year’s resolutions and set additional goals from a presumably clearer head space.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Break it Down</b></font> 
        <br>If we can break down our resources to their smallest components, then it becomes easier to see the hidden potential. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Turn Treasure into Trash</b></font> 
        <br>Keep a benefits diary to records unexpected benefits from you key events, activities, or experiences. “Once we find a hidden benefit in something, we can turn it into a treasure. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Stretch</i> is a very well done book. Good and relevant examples give power to the points he is making. 
        <b>By chasing resources we really limit our potential. Stretching brings out our best.</b>

Quite effectively, Hughes and Black go back and forth sharing their perspectives on the unfolding transformation. Naturally, it’s not a step-by-step prescription, but it is instructive to see the process because we all share similar issues and thinking. 
        <br>
        <br>They begin by 
        <b>debunking the "ego is good" myth</b>. Our egos limit us as we try to protect it in various ways. “Our ego can’t stand failure, incompetence, or weakness, so it avoids what is truly challenging us. 
        <br>
        <br>When we feel at the mercy of what is happening around us we react often distorting reality. “We read criticism, abandonment, judgment, competitiveness, and aggression into a situation where it may not exist.” We seek to fix what we believe is causing our distress resorting to learned behaviors that really don’t serve us well. 
        <br>
        <br>“
        <b>Anytime we know intellectually what to do, but our actual behavior is inconsistent or in contradiction, it is a sign we are being short-circuited by our egosystem.</b> These behavioral derailers come in many forms: conflict avoidance, procrastination, defensiveness, people pleasing, shutting down, being argumentative, just to name a few. Upon examination, these ingrained knee-jerk reactions invariably prove to be predictable and recurrent.” It’s not just the way we are, it’s the way we have learned to be. In order to defuse our reactive behaviors we need to identify the underlying triggers that created our behaviors in the first place. 
        <br>
        <br>Here are some insights from 
        <i>Ego Free Leadership</i>: 
        <br>
        <br>
        <blockquote>
         Intellectually it’s easy to decide that learning, growing, or creating authentic relationships is more important than not appearing incompetent, failing, or being hurt. 
         <i>Unfortunately, this is not how we feel at a visceral level, or we wouldn’t be continuously repeating these dysfunctional behaviors.</i> Transformation comes when we consciously connect with goals 
         <b>not tied to our self-worth</b> and use this emotional clarity to inspire action in the present moment. 
         <br>
         <br>The theoretical importance of having authentic, transparent conversations isn’t in question: 
         <i>it’s rather the practical difficulty of doing so when there isn’t <b>emotional safety</b> in the relationship</i>. 
         <br>
         <br>For our ego, 
         <b>the sensation of being right is like electricity to a lightbulb</b>. It fuels us with energy and vigor. We sit straighter, our voice sharpens, and our language hardens. We face an issue or a conflict, and we see the answer clearly. With this certainty comes a feeling of power and righteousness, as captivating as a drug rush. This is the way it is. 
         <b>Being right sweeps us so automatically into an aggressive mental stance that any collateral damage seems just a necessary evil.</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Our egosystem and brain can convince us of anything, regardless of its veracity. We can make—I myself have done it countless times—any number of important decisions with profound conviction, only to realize later it wasn’t really what we wanted or was based on incorrect perceptions. 
         <i>(“…clearly distinguishing between the facts I had collected and my conclusions about them.”)</i> 
         <br>
         <br>In each case, 
         <b>people experienced their frustration as true, when in fact they were unconsciously focusing on the negative in others</b>. Worse when we do this, our mindset and behaviors actually influence others to be less than their best selves, either because they don’t feel safe or because we simply don’t allow them to participate. We limit their potential.
        </blockquote> 
        <br>As the authors admit no organization (or individual) can be completely ego-free, but we can manage it better. In every situation 
        <b>we have a choice</b>. We can either give in to our ego or break free of the limits it imposes on us. They recommend: 
        <br>
        <br>
        <ol>
         <li>Notice the moments in your life when you experience a pinch. It might be an event or something someone says or does.</li> 
         <li>Instead of reacting, search for what is triggered in you. What is that visceral discomfort you’re trying to numb or you’re blaming others for? How is your sense of self-worth threatened?</li> 
         <li>Look outward and consider what vulnerabilities other might be feeling behind the veneer of strength or indifference. Empathize with how they feel in danger.</li> 
         <li>Take the risk of disclosing how you feel vulnerable. Share your ego threat, not your mind chatter. Model a context of safety.</li>
        </ol> 
        <br>
        <br>The lessons and insights shared in 
        <i>Ego Free Leadership</i> could have a profound effect on any reader.

        </div>ONFLICT is everywhere. Conflict at the most basic level is simply 
        <b>a gap between what we want and what we are experiencing at any given point in time</b>. 
        <br>
        <br>Conflict is energy, and can be used in positive or negative ways. Negative conflict becomes drama, and it is costly to companies, teams and relationships at all levels. In fact, according to a Gallup Poll, negative conflict drains the U.S. economy by about $350 billion a year in lost productivity and wasted energy. 
        <br>
        <br>In 
        <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781523082605.html" title="Conflict without Casualties"><i>Conflict without Casualties</i></a>, author Nate Regier believes that the 
        <b>misuse of conflict energy is the biggest crisis facing our world</b>, and that we haven’t even begun to harness the creative potential of conflict. When people embrace the fullest meaning of compassion as a process of “struggling with” others in creative conflict, they can transform lives, companies, and the world. 
        <br>
        <br>It is understandable that we try to avoid conflict considering all of the drama and negative fallout that always seems to accompany it. But Regier says if we use conflict correctly, we can use it to create. “Eliminating the casualties of conflict cannot happen by repressing the conflict and just ‘being nice.’ It happens by stewarding the energy inherent in conflict to make something positive, even amazing.” That seems like a tall order, but it makes sense. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Compassionate Accountability</b></font> 
        <br>
        <br>The way forward is to practice 
        <b><i>Compassionate Accountability</i></b>. Compassionate Accountability is a method for resisting the negative pull of drama—“I gotta win.” Negative conflict becomes drama. “Drama is the mismanaging of the energy of conflict. It diverts energy towards the pursuit of self-justification, one of the strongest human urges and the one that almost always gets us into trouble.” 
        <i>(Chapter 2 on drama is one of the clearest discussions of drama I’ve read.)</i> 
        <br>
        <br>To be compassionate is to struggle alongside 
        <i>with</i> others; to struggle 
        <i>with</i> instead of 
        <i>against</i>. “Compassion is the result of people taking ownership of their feelings, thoughts and behaviors, and choosing to spend the energy of conflict pursuing effective solutions that preserve the dignity of all involved. Compassion is more than care and concern for others. 
        <b>It’s about the willingness to get in the trenches and struggle together as an equal with others.</b>” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/compassion-cycle.png" width="224" height="225" align="right" alt="Compassion Cycle">Compassionate Accountability is based on 
        <b>three skills</b>: 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Openness</b></font> 
        <br>Openness is a state of non-judgmental receptivity to your own and others’ experiences. Openness is the healthy alternative to the Victim response that is a part of most drama. It also involves transparency, courage with self and others, self-awareness, empathy, confidence in one’s own adequacy, and a willingness to own and disclose emotions. Openness involves empathy (understanding others), validation (affirming others), and disclosure (sharing with others). 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Resourcefulness</b></font> 
        <br>If Openness reveals the real issues, motives, and emotions in our lives, then resourcefulness is the ability to problem-solve to satisfy those motives and address the issues. When there’s conflict, Openness is where we discover and affirm how the gap between what we want and what we’re experiencing is affecting us. Resourcefulness is the ability to understand the gap and figure out what to do about it. It requires the abandonment of the ego in order to gather ideas and opinions, analyze what has worked in the past, and leverage personal strengths. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Persistence</b></font> 
        <br>Persistence is all about seeing things through with integrity, humility, and respect. It’s accountability. It means setting boundaries, reinforcing non-negotiables, and accepting responsibility for your own behaviors. “Compassion without accountability gets you nowhere. Accountability without compassion gets you alienated. Blending the two is the essence of leadership.” 
        <br>
        <br>These three skills are a process that starts at Open, moves to Resourceful, and finally to Persistence. They are three interdependent ways of feeling, thinking, and acting that work productively together. 
        <br>
        <br>When Regier’s model is placed inside the 
        <b><i>Drama Triangle</i></b> (developed by Steven Karpman), the author creates a useful visual for understanding where we often end up if we don’t 
        <b>intentionally</b> stay the Compassionate Accountability course. 
        <br>
        <br>Regier writes: “Drama inevitably pushes us into corners, where we cling to distorted worldviews that compel us to do the same thing over and over, expecting different results. Compassion, on the other hand, keeps us moving, searching, nimble, effective, and capable of adapting to change.” It also keep us from being mired inside our own head and thus limiting our responses and our ability to reframe the conflict. We get stuck. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <center>
         <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/DramaCompassion-cycle.gif" width="400" height="329" alt="drama">
        </center> 
        <br>
        <br>It would seem that if you stop at Persistence then you become stagnant and eventually irrelevant. A state of non-judgmental receptivity would seem to go hand-in-hand with progress, the inevitability of change, and the understanding of others. “As a species, human beings seem to have a very difficult time returning to Openness in order to keep the cycle going. We take up residence at Persistence, which inevitably morphs into Persecutor as we fight to protect what we’ve built and save ourselves from the consequences of our own creation.” 
        <br>
        <br>He adds, “Each point on the Compassion Cycle has a purpose. 
        <b>When that purpose is fulfilled, it’s time to move.</b> Lingering after the purpose has been achieved is a recipe for stagnation and drama.” 
        <br>
        <br>If you want to end the drama in your life or organization then you have to replace it with something else. 
        <b>Compassionate Accountability is the cure.</b> Regier concludes the book with a section devoted to implementing this concept into everything you do. A very useful user’s manual.

        <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781101981351.html" title="Leadership Gap"><i>The Leadership Gap</i></a>, Lolly Daskal makes clear to us that “if we want to continue to have a positive impact on the world and make a difference, we must constantly rethink the instincts that drive us.” Leaders need to question “who they are being while they are leading.” 
        <br>
        <br>This need for leaders to rethink who they are gets to the heart of what Rosamund Stone Zander describes in 
        <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780670025183.html" title="Pathways to Possibility"><i>Pathways to Possibility</i></a>. Often, our growth requires that we live a new story. 
        <b>We are not “trained to think of ourselves as governed by stories made up by younger iterations of ourselves, frozen in time.</b>” 
        <br>
        <br>We need to rewrite the stories to reflect life as it is now. “I believe that when we become aware of patterns in our behavior, when we learn to identify and rewrite the stories that give us our identities, we will gain passage, at any age, into a new phase of adulthood. In this territory of maturity, where old fear-based pattern no longer hold us back, we will, I wager, do what we now think of as remarkable, even magical, things.” 
        <br>
        <br>We all have a point of view about how life should go and they are often illogical. But when they are we produce reasons for why we do and think like we do even if it has no basis on our current reality. They hold us back. What children’s stories have in common is 
        <i>survival anxiety</i>. We are living a story made up by a child when we are frightened about the future, are ready to run, feel the need to control others, act out of insecurity, and are unable to take criticism of any kind. 
        <br>
        <br>The stores we tell ourselves are generally adopted unknowingly from the environment in which we grew up and are not under the control of the reasoning mind. To move forward, we have to uncover the story and tell a new one. Zander repeatedly states that new habits are formed in an environment of love. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>How do you know if you are living in a story crafted by the mind of a child?</b></font>

        <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/arrowheadl.gif" width="8" height="11"> You are being captured by the child in you if you are certain that your views are true, and you make no attempt to question them.

        <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/arrowheadl.gif" width="8" height="11"> You are living in a child apart if you are regularly concerned with what others think of you.

        <br>Zander relates three rules that 
        <b>coach Pete Carroll</b> gave his players. Zander says that these three rule will help support the adoption of an adult story. “
        <b>These three rules</b>,” she writes, “
        <b>almost guarantee that the person who follows them is saved from the distraction of survival instincts</b>, such as possessiveness, entitlement, and winning over others, and feelings of helplessness, fear and rage when things don’t turn out the way he planned. Here are the three rules with Zander’s comments: 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Rule 1: Protect the Team:</b> A perfect instruction to remind a player that 
        <b>he is not, in fact, the center of the universe</b>, and to encourage him in all matters related to the game to adopt and 
        <b>live into a story of collaboration</b>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Rule 2: No Negative Talk. No Whining and Complaining:</b> This rule establishes that the game is played in a mode of possibility and not one of survival where players are out for themselves and can be weakened by a victim story. 
        <b>It requires that people be responsible for the effect of their words and their moods</b>, which ensures that the team maintains energy. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Rule 3: Be Early:</b> What powerful little words! What an amazing third rule! The player who lives by “be early” 
        <b>puts himself in charge of his life</b>. If you decide to be early, you are always in charge; you will show up as a considerate person as well as a paragon of responsibility.

        </div>N OUTWARD MINDSET will greatly impact how we negotiate our world and the impact we will have. An outward mindset helps us to see the world as it is and not how we imagine it to be. Our age increasingly requires us to collaborate more and more with others. An outward mindset is essential. 
        <br>
        <br>An outward mindset doesn’t come naturally. We have to consciously change how we think about others. 
        <br>
        <br>In 
        <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781626567153.html" title="The Outward Mindset"><i>The Outward Mindset</i></a>, the Arbinger Institute reports that “
        <b>the biggest lever for change is not a change in self-belief but a fundamental change in the way one sees and regards one’s connections with and obligations to others</b>.” 
        <br>
        <br>People and organizations get stuck when they have an inward mindset because when we are focused on ourselves and our needs, our reality becomes distorted. An inward mindset limits our possibilities and negatively affects our behavior and thus our relationships. 
        <br>
        <br>Arbinger reminds us that 
        <b>an inward mindset and introspection are not the same thing</b>. “One can introspect in a self-centered way, which 
        <i>would</i> indicate an inward mindset. However, a person also can introspect about one’s connections with others, which is the very essence of what we are calling outwardness. Sometimes it is helpful to look 
        <i>inside</i> to see how one is connected with what is 
        <i>outside</i>.” 
        <br>
        <br>Moving from an inward mindset to an outward mindset is more that a surface adjustment or behavioral change alone. It requires a change in how we see and thing about others. How we see and respond to others is not so much about them as it is a reflection of what is going on inside of us. We often fixate on other’s shortcomings so we don’t have to deal with our own. 
        <br>
        <br>Inward-mindset people and organizations 
        <i>do</i> things. Outward-mindset people and organizations 
        <i>help others to be able to do things</i>.” It is possible to be a inward-mindset person or organization masquerading as an outward-mindset person or organization if you aren’t paying attention to the needs, objectives, and challenges of those you are supposedly doing the work for. 
        <b><i>Whose needs are your primary focus?</i></b> 
        <br>
        <br>Arbinger has discovered that those who consistently work with an outward mindset follow a 
        <b>pattern</b>. They: 
        <br>
        <ol>
         <li><b>See the needs, objectives, and challenges of others</b> (Create opportunities for people to see each other so they can begin to talk.)<br><br></li> 
         <li><b>Adjust their efforts to be more helpful to others</b> (“Real helpfulness can’t be made into a formula. To be outward doesn’t mean that people should adopt this or that prescribed behavior. Rather, it means that when people see the needs, challenges, desire, and humanity of others, the most effective ways to adjust their efforts occur to them in the moment. When they see others as people, they respond in human and helpful ways.”)<br><br></li> 
         <li><b>Measure and hold themselves accountable for the impact of their work on others</b> (“Measuring one’s impact requires nothing but a willingness to stay in regular conversations with others about whether they feel one’s efforts are helping them or not.”)</li>
        </ol> 
        <br>
        <b>An outward-mindset begins with you.</b> “While the goal in shifting mindsets is to get everyone turned toward each other, accomplishing this goal is possible only if people are prepared to turn their mindsets toward others with no expectation that others will change their mindsets in return. This capability—to change the way I see and work with others regardless of whether they change—overcomes 
        <b>the biggest impediment to mindset change</b>: the natural, inward-mindset inclination to wait for others to change before doing anything different oneself.” This of course, is true leadership. 
        <br>
        <br>To begin: 
        <br>
        <ol>
         <li><b>Start with mindset.</b> Apply the outward-mindset pattern: see others, adjust efforts, and measure impact</li> 
         <li><b>Don’t wait for others to change.</b> The most important move is to turn your mindset regardless of whether others change theirs.</li> 
         <li><b>Mobilize yourself and your team or organization to achieve a collective goal.</b> Each person is oart of a larger whole.</li> 
         <li><b>Allow people</b> (beginning with yourself) <b>to be fully responsible</b>. Own your work—your plans, your actions, and your impact—and position others to own theirs.</li> 
         <li><b>Eliminate the unnecessary distinctions</b> that create distance between yourself and others.</li> 
         <li>To the extent that you have the authority to do so, <b>rethink systems and processes to turn them outward</b>; create an organizational ecosystem that energizes people rather than manage objects.</li>
        </ol>

        </div>OURNALIST AND FORMER EDITOR of the 
        <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, Jeff Selingo has written an insightful and essential guide as to why some people prosper after college and some fail or find themselves underemployed. You need more than a degree. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/2nasCt7" target="_blank"><i>There is Life After College</i></a> is a book that every student should read—twice. Frankly, it would hurt those already in the workplace to read it as the ground is shifting under our feet as well. 
        <br>
        <br>Employers are looking for 
        <b>T-shaped individuals</b>. The vertical bar represents depth of knowledge and the horizontal bar represents the ability to work across a variety of complex subject areas with ease and confidence. Something a liberal arts education is designed to do. 
        <br>
        <br>Selingo notes that too many undergraduates 
        <b>want to be spoon-fed</b>. “They sit back and wait for professors to deliver lessons in the classroom. They participate in campus life but too often from the sidelines, so they lack and deep engagement in activities that provide much needed skills for the job market. They fail to cultivate relationships with professors or staff on campus who might lend advice or act as mentors. And they are reluctant to chase after experiences—whether undergraduate research, study abroad, or internships—that help them discover their passions and arm them with the interpersonal skills so in demand by employers today.” 
        <br>
        <br>Selingo has distilled a lot of wisdom into 
        <b>five often overlapping skills needed to succeed in your career and life</b>. (You see these concepts are appearing more and more in leadership development studies as well.) I’ve listed them here with brief outtakes for each from the chapter. The book provides much more detail and practical advice for career and life on many fronts and well worth making them time to consider. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>1. Be Curious, Ask Questions, and Be a Learner for Life</b></font> 
        <br>
        <blockquote>
         The recent graduates who succeed in their careers are flexible about how they learn. “They have ideas and act on them,” said Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO. “Being able to get stuff done is a capacity that is rather important.” Most of all he’s looking for a mind-set with creativity, passion, and empathy at its root. “I want diversity of experiences in college that have exercised their brain,” Brown said. 
         <br>
         <br>On executive said, “Our industry is changing so fast that 
         <b>we can’t depend on what students already know</b>. We need people who are creative, curious, whose brains are wired to constantly ask what’s next. 
         <b>What we need are learning animals.</b>”
        </blockquote> 
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>2. Build an Expertise, Take Risks, and Learn the Meaning of Grit</b></font> 
        <br>
        <blockquote>
         “We see a lot of transferable skills in athletes,” Marie Artim, vice president of talent acquisition at Enterprise, told me. Enterprise is not alone. As employers search for signals that someone is ready for a job beyond achieving the baseline bachelor’s degree, participation in collegiate athletics is seen by many as one 
         <b>clear indicator of commitment and drive</b> in a generation of college graduates often lacking both. 
         <br>
         <br>The qualities prized in athletes obviously apply to other college activities. Employers told me they value musicians, game designers, and writers in much the same way. 
         <br>
         <br>“We want to see that they have a passion, and they show proficiency and go deep in it.” The more time students spend trying to master a skill or a job, the more likely they are to encounter failure. “Our best employees are problem solvers and are able to weave everything they know together—customer service, empathy, persuasive skills, leadership skills, flexibility, and work ethic,” Marie Artim of Enterprise told me. “They can think on their feet.” 
         <br>
         <br>Selingo adds, “What is unfortunate is that our desire to protect our kids and fill every waking moment of their schedules with organized activities seems to only worsen as they get older.” So they never find opportunities to take risks and perhaps fail. 
         <br>
         <br>Recruiters are looking for applicants who have overcome challenges and learned from their disappointments.
        </blockquote> 
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>3. Every Job is a Tech Job</b></font> 
        <br>
        <blockquote>
         Understanding the programming language behind the apps on your iPhone or the basics of artificial intelligence is now seen as basic foundational skills by many employers. Learning to program is much like learning a second language was in the twentieth century: You might not become proficient enough to move overseas, but you could get by if you traveled to a particular country. 
         <br>
         <br>“It’s more about 
         <b>giving people the skills and tools they learn in the act of coding</b>,” Carol Smith, who oversees Google’s Summer of Code program, told Wired magazine. “It gives them the critical thinking skills that are important whether or not they go into computer science as a profession.” 
         <br>
         <br>The generation entering college and the workforce now are often referred to as “digital natives” because they were raised on technology from a very young age. But their relationship has been largely passive: switch on the device and use it. Being digitally aware isn’t about turning more people into computer geeks. It’s about moving from a passive relationship with technology to a more 
         <b>active one</b>—especially in understanding the how and why behind machines, not just the what.
        </blockquote> 
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>4. Learn to Deal with Ambiguity</b></font> 
        <br>
        <blockquote>
         “Excelling at any job is about 
         <b>doing the things you weren’t asked to do</b>,” said Mary Egan, founder of Gatheredtable, a Seattle-based start-up, and former senior vice president for strategy and corporate development at Starbucks. “This generation is not as comfortable with figuring out what to do.” 
         <br>
         <br>The ability to negotiate ambiguity on the job requires people to think contextually, to provide what I call the “connective tissue” that occupies the space in between ideas. It is the “killer app” of today’ workplaces. People who make these connections do so by following their curiosity and exploring and learning from peers. Knowledge is not only what is in our brains, but also what is distributed through our networks. Learning happens by building and navigating those networks.
        </blockquote> 
        <br>
        <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>5. Be Humble and Learn from Your Peers and Mentors</b></font> 
        <br>
        <blockquote>
         People who manage recent college graduates all had the same complaint about their new hires: they’re too impatient about their careers and unrealistic about their roles within a company. A friend who is my age and a manager at a major media company told me about new graduates who applied for senior roles after less than a year on the job and who were flabbergasted when they didn’t get the promotion, which went to someone with ten or twenty years more experience. 
         <br>
         <br>Being socially aware goes beyond knowing your role within the organization. It includes important skill sets like written and verbal communication as well as the ability to deal with negative feedback, speak in public, and, most of all, interact on a basic human level with coworkers and clients that doesn’t involve texting them. 
         <br>
         <br>eBay offers classes on 
         <b>managing your personal brand</b> (because graduates usually can’t set goals for themselves), 
         <b>giving an elevator pitch</b> (they often can’t get to their point fast enough), 
         <b>managing your calendar</b> (once again, time management), and 
         <b>performance reviews</b>.
        </blockquote> 
        <br>Selingo emphasizes that what you 
        <b><i>do</i></b> in college (and therefore what you become—who you 
        <b><i>are</i></b>) is typically more important than where you go. 
        <br>

         <b style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; float: left; margin-right: 4px; line-height: 1em; color: #FFFFFF; background: #808000; padding: 0 5px; font-weight: normal;">H</b>UMILITY casts a wide net and makes possible the work of leadership. Nothing facilitates community, collaboration, and innovation like humility. 
         <br>
         <br>In 
         <a href="http://amzn.to/2gmR0Vm" target="_blank"><i>Humility is the New Smart</i></a>, Ed Hess and Katherine Ludwig define humility as “a mindset about oneself that is open-minded, self-accurate, and not all about me, and that enables one to embrace the world as it is in the pursuit of human excellence.” 
         <br>
         <br>Their definition encompasses the mind of a leader that will be able to lead in a changing and uncertain world. Humility is inclusive. It is inclusive of others ideas, others needs, others strengths, other contributions, and the realities that exist outside of our own head. A humble leader asks more questions and is open to more answers thus deepening the pool of resources they have to draw upon. But it requires a strength of character. As senior vice president of the NBA’s Orlando Magic, Pat Williams writes in 
         <i><a href="http://amzn.to/2mnZNZK" target="_blank">Humility</a>: The Secret Ingredient of Success</i>: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <ul>
          <li>Humble leaders are strong enough to listen to other points of view.</li> 
          <br>
          <li>Humble leaders are strong enough to admit their mistakes and learn from them.</li> 
          <br>
          <li>Humble leaders are strong enough to celebrate their achievements of others.</li> 
          <br>
          <li>Humble leaders are strong enough to surround themselves with talented people without feeling threatened or diminished.</li>
         </ul> 
         <br>Additionally, 
         <br>
         <br>
         <ul>
          <li>Humble people treat others as equals.</li> 
          <br>
          <li>Humble people don’t claim to know everything.</li> 
          <br>
          <li>Humble people are better team players.</li> 
          <br>
          <li>Humble people are willing to set aside their egos.</li>
         </ul> 
         <br>Humility is the antidote to insecurity that often plagues us. A lack of humility actually drives insecurity. Humility makes your strengths productive and multiplies the strengths of others. Humility acknowledges a world beyond our own thinking and minimizes our own limitations. A good leader knows this and acts accordingly to produce the best results. 
         <br>
         <br>Do you have the strength to be humble?

         <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/ReachMolinsky.jpg" width="500" height="250" alt="Thank You for Being Late"> 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; float: left; margin-right: 4px; line-height: 1em; color: #FFFFFF; background: #808000; padding: 0 5px; font-weight: normal;">Y</b>OU'VE NO DOUBT HEARD that it is outside our comfort zone where the magic happens. But how do we get outside our comfort zone? It’s not always easy in some cases too stressful to consider. 
         <br>
         <br>Andy Molinsky gives us some practical first steps in 
         <i><a href="9780316388399.html">Reach</a>: A New Strategy to Help You Step Outside Your Comfort Zone, Rise to the Challenge and Build Confidence.</i> 
         <br>
         <br>We often fail to get outside our comfort zone because of the feeling that it’s too big a reach (which is why they’re outside your comfort zone): “It’s not me,” “People won’t like this version of me,” “It’s embarrassing because I’m clearly not good at this,” “Why should I have to do this,” and/or “Maybe this isn’t something I should be doing.” So commonly, we do nothing. We avoid it altogether. Or we only do it half-heartedly. All of these things sabotage our efforts. 
         <br>
         <br>So the question to ask yourself is, 
         <b>"If I could erase the anxiety and distress, is it something I’d like to be able to do?"</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Molinsky has interviewed and also observed people in many different professions and walks of life. And the stories he includes from managers, executives, priests, baristas, stay-at-home-moms, singers, actors and performers, are helpful and relatable. And although these people are very different, there is a common theme. He has found that those most successful at getting outside of their comfort zones have 
         <b>three things</b> going for them: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Conviction—Making Sure the Gain is Worth the Discomfort</b></font>
         <br> It’s a deep sense of purpose that it’s actually worth it to endure the strain or stress entailed in stepping outside your comfort zone. This is the “why am I doing this?” And that can come from anywhere. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Customization—Designing a Personalized Baby-Step Plan</b></font>
         <br> This is the ability to tweak or adjust in often very slight ways how you perform a task to make it feel more comfortable and natural. When facing difficult situations we often feel powerless, but we can alter situations to play to our strengths. For example, we can change the words we use or the topics we talk about, change our body language, or change the timing or location. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Clarity—Getting Some Perspective on Your Fears</b></font>
         <br> Clarity is the ability to develop an even-handed, reasonable perspective on the challenges you face. “It is an attempt to be as true as possible with ourselves about the situations we’re currently working on, taking a careful inventory of our true feelings—even if we’re embarrassed by them—as well as an inventory of our avoidance strategies.” In other words, to not succumb to the distorted and exaggerated thinking so many of us do in very stressful situations. It may not really be as far outside of our comfort zones as we imagine. 
         <br>
         <br>Here are 
         <b>Five Comfort Zone Myths</b> to consider: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Myth #1: All it takes to step outside your comfort zone is taking a leap.</b> 
         <br>
         <i>Reality: Very few people spontaneously “leap” outside their comfort zones; rather, that leap is the result of considerable thinking and deliberation.</i> 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Myth #2: The “magic” only happens outside your comfort zone.</b> 
         <br>
         <i>Reality: The “magic” can happen both inside and outside your comfort zone.</i> 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Myth #3: I’m the only one who struggles with situations outside my comfort zone.</b> 
         <br>
         <i>Reality: Nearly everyone struggles with situations outside their comfort zones.</i> 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Myth #4: Getting out of your comfort zone is just about “sucking it up.”</b> 
         <br>
         <i>Reality: “Sucking it up” is important, but so too are other strategies which, in fact, can ultimately make ‘sucking it up’ less necessary.</i> 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Myth #5: With enough inspiration, anyone can stretch outside their comfort zone.</b> 
         <br>
         <i>Reality: Anyone can do it, but it takes more than inspiration; it takes effort, persistence, strategy, and a keen understanding of the challenges.</i>

As a result, so many aspects of our societies, workplaces, and geopolitics are being reshaped and need to be remained.” 
         <br>
         <br>As he notes, it more than just change it is reshaping that is taking place. It’s hard for any of us to keep up. “In such a time, opting to pause and reflect, rather than panic or withdraw, is a necessity. It is not a luxury or a distraction—it is a way to increase the odds that you’ll better understand, and engage productively with, the world around you.” 
         <br>

         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780374273538.html" title="Thomas Friedman"><i>Thank You for Being Late</i></a>, comes from realizing that a guest’s tardiness to a meeting gave him time to just sit and think. And he was better for it. So, “Thank you for being late.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <a href="http://amzn.to/2e9XsdA" target="_blank"><i>Thank You for Being Late</i></a> succeeds in presenting a better understanding of why the world is the way it is. What follows is a small selction of thoughts and analysis of and prescriptions for the world we live in: 
         <br>
         <br>☙ As the world becomes more interdependent and complex, it becomes more vital than ever to widen your aperture and to synthesize more perspectives. 
         <br>
         <br>☙ Creativity becomes, in part, about asking the best questions. 
         <br>
         <br>☙ You can’t just show up. You need a plan to succeed. You have to know more, you have to update what you know more often, and you have to do more creative things with it. Self-motivation is now so much more important. 
         <br>
         <br>☙ It is so easy to forget that many, many people in America don’t have a professional network, an alumni network, two parents, or in some cases anyone around them with a job, to consult about how to get one. 
         <br>
         <br>☙ In a world of so many choices, it’s hard to know what to do. 
         <br>
         <br>☙ Social media is good for collective sharing, but not always so great for collective building; good for collective destruction, but maybe not so good for collective construction; fantastic for generating a flash mob, but not so good at generating a flash consensus on a party platform or a constitution. 
         <br>
         <br>☙ Quoting Jeffrey Garten, the former dean of the Yale School of Management: Maybe this is overly romantic, but I think leadership is going to require the ability to come to grips with values and ethics. The more technological we get, the more we need people who have a much broader framework. You’ll be able to hire the technologist to make systems work, but in terms of the goals, that takes a different kind of leader. 
         <br>
         <br>☙ A number of technological forces came together to create an exponential step in change in the power of men and machines—much faster than we have been able to reshape our institutions, our laws, and our modes of leadership. Quoting Dov Seidman: Technology creates possibilities for new behaviors and experiences and connection, but it takes human beings to make the behaviors principled, the experiences meaningful and the connections deeper and rooted in shared values and aspirations. 
         <br>
         <br>☙ No better source of restraint then a strong community. 
         <br>
         <br>☙ It is only when people relax their hearts and their minds that they are open to hear and engage with others, and healthy communities create a context for that.

         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Civility isn’t just the absence of incivility. </b>In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781455568987.html" title="Mastering Civility"><i>Mastering Civility</i></a>, Christine Porath explains that “Civility in the fullest sense requires something more: positive gestures of respect, dignity, courtesy, or kindness that lift people up.” 
         <br>
         <br>Incivility impacts our health and performance. It depletes our “immune system, causing cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and ulcers.” It also robs us of our “cognitive resources, hijacks our performance and creativity, and sidelines us from our work. Even if we want to perform at our best, we can’t, because we’re bothered and preoccupied by the rudeness.” 
         <br>
         <br>Incivility is contagious. “When you’re exposed to hostility or aggression, you behave differently. 
         <b>Incivility sneaks into your subconscious.</b> It’s easy to see how plagues of incivility can take shape and spread.” But you don’t have to succumb to incivility. “When you follow a rude experience with a polite one, the polite one ‘overwrites’ the rude one, loosening the hold it has on your mind.” 
         <br>
         <br>Civility starts with a few basic behaviors and it grows from there. Simple things like saying please and thank you make a difference in how we are perceived by others and the influence we have on them. “Most of us are in a hurry to prove our competence, but warmth contributes significantly more to others’ evaluations. Warmth is the pathway to influence.” 
         <br>
         <br>Other basic behaviors include acknowledging people and listening. They signal caring, commitment and connection. Show respect for others by sharing resources, the limelight, and positive feedback. “The highest performers offer more positive feedback with their peers; in fact, high-performing teams share six times more positive feedback than average teams. Meanwhile, low-performing teams share twice as much negative feedback than average teams.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>What if you are the victim of incivility?</b> 
         <br>
         <br>When someone is being uncivil to you it’s easy to let your emotions take over. It’s easy to get sucked in to their incivility. Porath advises you to avoid the temptation to get even. It’s not a win for you. 
         <br>
         <br>The best advice has nothing to do with them and everything to do with you. How will you choose to interpret it? Here are a few of her thoughts: 
         <br>
         <blockquote>
          When you experience incivility, your sense of thriving comes into play in a particular way: by making it easier for you to reframe the negativity of the event so that it isn’t nearly as destructive. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>What are you going to make this mean?</b> How you interpret the situation is crucial. How much are you going to let someone pull you down? What useful lessons might there be for you in the situation? 
          <br>
          <br>Science reveals that about 50m percent of our happiness is based on brain wiring; 40 percent is owed to how we interpret and respond to what happens to us, and 10 percent is driven by our circumstances. 
          <br>
          <br>In large part, 
          <b>you really do get to decide how you interpret incivility, the meaning you assign to it, and the stories you tell yourself</b>. You also get to control whether it makes you feel bad or not. It may not be realistic for you to “toughen up,” but you can choose not to worry about what was said or done to you.”
         </blockquote> 
         <br>Everyone would agree that we should be civil and we recoil when we see others engaged in it, yet incivility has become more commonplace. Somehow we feel justified being uncivil when things don’t go our way. And it costs us all. 
         <br>
         <br>Uncivil behavior does not generate greater influence no matter how loud you are. Most leadership failures can be attributed to abrasive or arrogant approaches to others. 
         <b>Uncivil leaders eventually undermine their own potential.</b>

         <br>
         <br> 
         <b style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; float: left; margin-right: 4px; line-height: 1em; color: #FFFFFF; background: #808000; padding: 0 5px; font-weight: normal;">T</b>OM ASACKER always makes you think. 
         <br>
         <br>Life is not scripted but we live it as though it were. In doing so, we create boxes that we operate within without ever really seeing the possibilities. “We’re confined in mental prisons of our own creation.” 
         <br>
         <br>We make these scripts up or others make them up for us and eventually we come to believe them. And the problem is we think that is reality. It’s that story inside our head that keeps us from flourishing as we should—a life that moves us. We are sabotaging ourselves. 
         <br>
         <br>We act more like Coleridge and less like Keats. In 
         <a href="http://amzn.to/2kPLSIR" title="I Am Keats" target="_blank"><i>I Am Keats</i></a>, Asacker develops a metaphor for two worldviews as expressed through the poetry of two 19th century poets: Coleridge and Keats. 
         <br>
         <br>Keats was passionate. He was moved by his senses and imagination. Capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries and doubts, he was uninhibited, open, and without judgment. 
         <br>
         <br>We are conditioned – perhaps predisposed – to live in Coleridge’s worldview. Coleridge wants to predict an unknowable future. He is logic, order, control and progress. Coleridge wants you to live a productive and mistake-free life. “He is an expert craftsman, skilled in the rights and wrongs of the world, and turned on by the desire for risk aversion, accumulation and conformity.” 
         <br>
         <br>Neither is right or wrong but we need to be aware of the dynamic between the two or we never really live. We never see the possibilities. 
         <i>Knowing</i> is safe. 
         <i>Being</i> is frightening – “a dynamic dance with reality.” 
         <br>
         <br>But we are held captive by our beliefs—what we believe to be reality. “Here’s the thing about our beliefs. We don’t want them pointed out to us. We don’t want to have our soothing stories interrupted. We don’t want to be woken up from our script, from our reassuring routines. Otherwise, we’ll have to think. And then, heaven forbid, we may have to change. 
         <br>
         <br>Asacker writes, “Let go of your incessant desire to know, to predict and influence, and instead be willing to experience the mystery of the present without corrupting it with questions.” 
         <br>
         <br>When you allow yourself to become more like Keats, “you find yourself being pulled deeper and deeper into a process that creates serendipitous connections and refines your perceptions. Your old eyes adjust to a new world, and you become more creative 
         <i>and</i> discerning.” 
         <br>
         <br>Experience the moment. “Your present creates the meaning of your past.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <a href="http://amzn.to/2kPLSIR" title="I Am Keats" target="_blank"><i>I Am Keats</i></a> is a book for our times. It is a philosophy says Asacker. “Magic, then logic. Heart, then head.” Try it.

         <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2013/01/01/just-8-of-people-achieve-their-new-years-resolutions-heres-how-they-did-it/#7f6dd42c304c" title="Survey" target="_blank">Surveys</a> show that while some 40 percent of us make them, only 8 percent of us keep them. We may feel exhilarated when we set a big goal, but that soon gives way to anxiety. While we all want to get better, lofty goals don’t always help. 
         <br>
         <br>There is a way to set goals 
         <i>and</i> achieve them. It comes from Rick Peterson, the former Major League Baseball pitching coach (of 
         <i>Moneyball</i> fame), who guided the New York Mets and the Oakland A’s to great success. He did it by getting his pitchers to 
         <b>scale back their goals from lofty to bite-sized, from outcome to process</b>. His mantra, “Hit the glove,” was not only powerful and effective, it translates well beyond professional baseball. 
         <br>
         <br>At the beginning of spring training, Rick would ask his pitchers, “What’s your goal?” Most had the kind of long-term, outcome goals you find on the back of a baseball card — winning a certain number of games or pitching a certain number of innings. 
         <br>
         <br>The problem with focusing on great big goals is that you’re distracted into focusing on factors outside your control. Winning a ball game involves more than just the pitcher’s performance — it hinges on how many runs his team scores, how well his team fields, how well the opposing hitters handle good pitches, and even the umpire’s calls. When we don’t hit that big outcome goal we get demoralized, creating doubt and anxiety can hurt our performance. 
         <br>
         <br>Instead, Rick refocused his pitchers on short-term, bite-sized 
         <b>process goals</b>. He told them they were professional glove hitters with one simple goal: Hit the catcher’s glove as often as possible — with the right pitch. 
         <br>
         <br>If a player focuses on hitting that glove, he can’t focus on the pressure of a loftier outcome goal. He has to concentrate on 
         <b><i>hitting that glove</i></b>. He’s not distracted by things outside his control. Hitting the glove on a high percentage of pitches is also the most probable path to achieving larger, outcome-oriented individual and team goals. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>How It Translates</b></font> 
         <br>
         <br>We can all learn to refocus on hitting that glove. I’ve been in sales for decades. At the start of every year, salespeople’s anxieties peak. Whatever numbers they produced last year, they no longer matter. The scoreboard’s back to zero. Time to prove yourself all over again. 
         <br>
         <br>Many sales organizations try to motivate their sales forces with talk of raising the bar and hitting even bigger numbers. But that lofty-goal approach can trigger fear and worry instead. Just like pitchers, salespeople know there are parts of the sales game beyond our control. And it’s easy to lose focus amidst the cornucopia of daily distractions. 
         <br>
         <br>After I heard Rick’s mantra, “Hit the glove!” I thought of what that meant in terms of my day-to-day sales. I settled on 
         <i>high-quality interactions with customers and prospects</i>, meaning one that advances a sale and/or our relationship. By focusing on having daily, high-quality interactions with customers, I would make great progress toward putting a dent in my quota. 
         <br>
         <br>Thinking about how many high-quality interactions I should have each day, I set the initial target at two. Before you laugh and ask what I was going to do after lunch, consider the math. Two high-quality interactions per day are 10 per week, and 40 per month. Assuming one month of vacation, that’s 440 per year — far more than I was averaging. 
         <br>
         <br>As soon as I started focusing on my new simple, short-term, bite-sized process goal — two high-quality interactions with customers each day — I began thinking about my day differently. I began prioritizing those two high-quality interactions with customers above everything else. As I considered how to invest my time, I regularly asked myself, “
         <b><i>Is this helping me hit the glove?</i></b>” 
         <br>
         <br>As a result, my focus improved remarkably. I wasted less time. I didn’t give my quota a second thought. My numbers took off, and I finished the year more than 25 percent ahead of my previous year’s performance. Focusing on that one small change brought about big results. So ask yourself: 
         <b><i>What’s your version of hitting the glove?</i></b>

         <b style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; float: left; margin-right: 4px; line-height: 1em; color: #FFFFFF; background: #808000; padding: 0 5px; font-weight: normal;">W</b>E KNOW GRATITUDE makes relationships thrive and makes trust possible. Gratitude encourages, clarifies, motivates, includes, and unifies. 
         <br>
         <br>When we show gratitude, people feel valued, they know what’s important, they want to do more, and they feel part of something bigger than themselves. 
         <br>
         <br>But gratitude is good for 
         <b><i>you</i></b> too. 
         <br>
         <br>Gratitude puts you in the right mindset to lead. Gratitude and humility are interconnected. They reinforce each other. Gratitude says, “I didn’t do this alone.” French philosopher Andre Comte-Sponville wrote, The narcissistic leader or “the egoist is ungrateful because he doesn’t like to acknowledge his debt to others and gratitude is this acknowledgement.” A lack of gratitude is at the core of narcissism. We alone are not responsible for who we are and what we do and that is the essence of leadership. We are never truly self-sufficient. 
         <br>
         <br>In a practical way, 
         <b>gratitude provides guardrails in our life</b>. Gratitude helps us to protect from ourselves. It is amazing how much gratitude plays into avoiding poor behavior and wrong thinking. Gratitude sets a boundary on our thoughts by making us mindful of others. It helps us to avoid going where we should not go because we are more self-aware. 
         <br>
         <br>Gratitude 
         <b>requires that we slow down and reflect</b>. Gratitude is the basis of emotional intelligence. It puts other people first. It says you know and you care. While empathy has been found to be essential to leadership, empathy is not empathy if it is silent. It must be expressed. 
         <br>
         <br>Gratefulness helps to curb unproductive emotions such as frustration, resentment, and revenge. Studies have shown that it is an antidote to depression. It has the power to heal and move us forward. 
         <br>
         <br>It improves relationships and is a remedy to envy and greed. Instead of trying to strive with others we are thankful for what they do. It eliminates a leader’s tendency towards entitlement. Grateful people find more meaning in life and feel more connected to others. 
         <br>
         <br>In these changing and uncertain times, gratitude is a leaders ally. Gratitude looks at the long term and doesn’t focus on the present situation. Life is a continuum. Gratitude allows a leader to appreciate where they are and the resources they have at their disposal to face what life throws at them. A habit of gratitude gives us perspective. It doesn’t blind us to the negative but it facilitates a solution. 
         <br>
         <br>Gratitude can’t just be something we do is has to be who we are as a leader. More than a behavior 
         <b>it must come from the heart</b>. It must be the mindset we lead from, manage from, and make decisions from. Gratefulness is grounded in reality because ultimately we must realize that everything good in our life is a gift. 
         <br>
         <br>Leadership begins and ends with gratefulness.

          <a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/1Q4qOXn" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781517061838sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Truth Trust Tenacity"></a>
         </div>One of the critical lessons I’ve learned in life - and it extends beyond the workplace - is the importance of respect. This may seem old-fashioned or trite in the days of, “I got mine, go get yours,” but if you treat people right, you will get the results you want. This is especially true in business. Respect still matters! 
         <br>
         <br>Great leaders appreciate every job that is done well; it doesn’t matter whether it’s in the C-suite or the mailroom. Great leaders also understand that respect isn’t an entitlement linked to a particular job title. They need to respect others before others will respect them. 
         <br>
         <br>So, 
         <b>how do you earn respect in business? Here are 10 ways:</b> 
         <ol>
          <li><b>Lead by example.</b> Embody the qualities and traits you expect from the people you lead and people you deal with. You want your workers and peers to be honest, so be honest yourself in all your business dealings. If you want your employees to be hardworking, set that example and quit taking long lunches or leaving the office early all the time. Model the traits you want others to show, such as integrity, kindness, creativity, inventiveness and industriousness.</li> 
          <li><b>Be humble.</b> Don’t expect anyone to care about where you went to college or your past successes. Plenty of businesspeople went to top universities and graduated with honors, and plenty more win awards and honors from chambers of commerce all the time. Braggarts are boring and turn people off. Get over yourself and do it quickly. Avoid self-promotion and publicity stunts. They are obvious and obnoxious and can damage your reputation. </li> 
          <li><b>Show your commitment every single day.</b> Work alongside the people you lead. Work longer and harder than they do. Get in the trenches and get your hands dirty once in a while. If you manage a warehouse, manufacturing plant or factory, make it a point on a regular basis to get off the phone, get out of your office and visit the production floor. Talk to the employees, get to know their names so you can address them personally, ask them how things are going, and pitch in if needed. Ask them if there are any glitches that need correcting.</li> 
          <li><b>Help people succeed and advance.</b> Promote your staff. Help your employees gain exposure and give them opportunities for development and advancement. Great leaders let their teams shine and are confident enough not to need the spotlight.</li> 
          <li><b>Be a teacher or mentor.</b> People always have other work or educational opportunities regardless of the economy and will leave your business unless they see an investment is being made in their future. Focus on those people who are bright, hardworking, dedicated, reliable and creative, and have skill sets that you don’t, or those who show potential. Mentor them at work or support programs that allow them to earn a new skill certification or degree.</li> 
          <li><b>Strike a balance between delegating and being hands-on.</b> An excessive delegator is opting out of responsibility, but keeping too tight control of everything deflates employees and tells them that you don’t value or trust their judgment. Find the middle ground.</li> 
          <li><b>Encourage creativity.</b> Take chances to come up with new ideas. Teach people how to take calculated risks, and then let them test their wings. Don’t punish failure. Learn from mistakes. A leader has to create a setting where there is a full vetting of ideas, where everyone is expected to provide suggestions, and where nothing is necessarily wrong.</li> 
          <li><b>Share your expectations of others.</b> People want to know what is expected of them so they can work to meet or exceed expectations. Help your employees succeed by letting them know what’s expected of them. </li> 
          <li><b>Reward success.</b> If it’s a small business, thank those who do a good job with a personal handwritten note, a lunch out or a small gift card. Large businesses should have an employee reward or recognition program to acknowledge employee successes on a regular basis. People want to be acknowledged for a job well done and will appreciate being called out for respect in front of their peers.</li> 
          <li><b>Build coalitions and maintain civility in all business dealings.</b> The “divide and conquer” approach doesn’t work in the private sector or in government. Nothing gets done! Civility and compromise are essential. Lots of people think that if you compromise, you’re weak. Nothing could be further from the truth. Leaders who compromise come across as caring leaders who are able to put others before themselves and who go out of their way to spend time understanding a differing point of view, even if they don’t act on it. Incivility impedes productivity - and profits.</li>

         <ol>
          <li><b>The ability to quickly master hard things.</b> (If you can’t learn you can’t thrive.)</li> 
          <li><b>The ability to produce at an elite level</b>, in terms of both quality and speed. (To produce tangible results that people value. What Seth Godin calls the ability to “ship.”)</li>
         </ol> These two abilities depend on your ability to perform deep work. 
         <br>
         <br>Cal Newport bases his book 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781455586691.html"><i>Deep Work</i></a> on the 
         <b><i>Deep Work Hypothesis</i></b>: The ability to perform deep work is becoming 
         <b>increasingly <i>rare</i></b> at exactly the same time it is becoming 
         <b>increasingly <i>valuable</i></b> in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive. 
         <br>
         <br>Learning is an act of deep work. An act of intense focus. “To produce at a peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.” 
         <br>
         <br>The reason deep work is rare is because we encourage distractions by the way we design our life. “An interruption, even if short, delays the total time required to complete a task by a significant fraction.” Deep work is not a priority. We are what we focus on and that is increasingly, the superficial. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Shallow work adds to our sense of meaninglessness.</b> Science writer Winifred Gallagher observed that “when you lose focus, you mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what’s right.” Newport adds: “A workday driven by the shallow, from a neurological perspective, is likely to be a draining and upsetting day, even if most of the shallow things that capture your attention seem harmless or fun.” 
         <br>
         <br>To fight the drift into the superficial we need to cultivate some strategies to develop a deep work habit. Here are a few Newport suggests: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Find Your Deep Work Philosophy</b></font> 
         <br>Newport describes four approaches to making time for deep work. There is the 
         <b><i>Monastic</i></b> approach that eliminates or radically minimizes shallow obligations. The 
         <b><i>Bimodal</i></b> approach that suggests binging on deep work for various lengths of time. The 
         <b><i>Rhythmic</i></b> approach makes deep work a habit by scheduling a regular chain of deep work in your day. The last approach and the one Newport prefers, is called the 
         <b><i>Journalistic</i></b> approach. Using this approach you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule. This last approach however, requires a great deal of willpower and practice. The Rhythmic approach may work best to get you started. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Take Breaks from Focus</b></font> 
         <br>Make deep work a priority by
         <b> taking breaks from focus, not from distraction</b>. “The idea motivating this strategy is that use of a distracting service does not, by itself, reduce your brain’s ability to focus. It’s instead the constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Quit Social Media</b></font> 
         <br>Network tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and infotainment sites like Business Insider and Buzzfeed, “fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate.” 
         <b>The overuse of social media unwittingly cripples our ability to succeed in the world of knowledge work.</b> “To master the art of deep work, therefore, you must take back control of your time and attention from the many diversions that attempt to steal them.” Newport recommends that we only use a tool if its positive impact on the core factors that determine our success and happiness, substantially outweigh it negative impacts. 
         <blockquote>
          If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, you’ll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing.
         </blockquote> 
         <br>
         <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>Be Intentional with Your Time</b></font> 
         <br>Have a plan for your day. Confine the shallow work you must do, don’t eliminate it. If you start your day with blocks of deep work scheduled in, you stand a much better chance of actually getting some deep work done. “Your goal is not to stick to a given schedule at all costs; it’s instead to maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you’re doing with your time going forward—even if those decisions are reworked again and again as the day unfolds.” 
         <br>
         <br>“To succeed,” writes Newport, “you have to produce the absolute best stuff you’re capable of producing—a task that requires depth. A deep life is a good life.”

         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Fear and Anxiety:</b> Instead of enjoying where you are at you allow the uncertainty of the world around you to overwhelm you with stress and a sense of trepidation. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Choice Overload:</b> We allow the choice we have to paralyze us. This is brought on “by a recent phenomenon called 
         <b>FOMO</b> (Fear of Missing Out). Twentysomethings live in a 24/7 plugged-in culture. We live in an era where we are accosted by the incessant meals, vacations, parties, and sheer awesomeness people are experiencing—thanks to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. According to a new study by Eventbrite, 69 percent of millennials experience FOMO when they can’t attend something that their family or friends are going to.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Too Busy to Slow Down:</b> Are we doing the things we really should be doing? We are overscheduled, overworked and over committed. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Obsessive Comparison Disorder:</b> We can always find people who are doing better than us and we want what everyone else has. ‘Millennial expert Paul Angone calls this 
         <b>Obsessive Comparison Disorder</b> (OCD). He says, “OCD is the smallpox of our generation.” This is an epidemic that is producing unwanted thoughts and feelings, driving us into depression, consumption, anxiety, and all-around discontent. The grass is not always greener on the other side. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The YOLO/FOMO Generation:</b> You only live once. It’s easy to get stuck in the moment. Social media encourages this thinking and the resulting drift into instant gratification and self-absorption. 
         <br>
         <br>Paul Sohn is talking to twenty-somethings but we all can learn from his experience. The context changes but the principles are the same. 
         <br>
         <br>The answer is to find your sweet spot—that place where you are living out your calling. Sohn says it is found at the intersection of your 
         <b>personality</b> (
         <i>who you are wired to be</i>), 
         <b>gifts</b> (
         <i>that which you are naturally gifted in</i>), 
         <b>passions</b> (
         <i>that which ignites a fire in your soul</i>), and 
         <b>life story</b> (
         <i>what doors have opened and closed in your life</i>). It is here that you will find your purpose that will lead you to a meaningful life. 
         <br>

          <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/SohnSweetSpot.jpg" width="450" height="400" alt="Sweet Spot">
         </center> 
         <br>In a noisy world it is hard to slow down enough to know yourself. Finding your sweet-spot begins with getting outside of yourself—seeing yourself from another perspective. A meaningful life comes from something outside yourself. Sohn found that in the Bible. It allowed him to integrate his life around a concept outside of his present. It makes all the difference. 
         <br>
         <br>For twenty-somethings, Sohn says the key is to start well. Start early. 
         <blockquote>
          As a clinical psychologist who specializes in twentysomethings, Meg Jay [author of 
          <i>Defining Decade</i>] has observed how twentysomethings have considered this time as a throwaway decade, paying the price, professionally, personally, spiritually, and economically later in life. This is the biggest myth out there. No more procrastination. No more wasting away your time, talent, and treasure believing you can make it up later in life.
         </blockquote> 
         <br>Keep learning. Find mentors. Life isn’t meant to be a rat-race. You were meant to flourish. Begin today.

         <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is a post by Achim Nowak, the author of <i><a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/1n1KwLr" target="_blank">The Moment</a>: A Practical Guide to Creating a Mindful Life in a Distracted World</i></font> 
         <br>
         <br>We live in a hugely distracted world. Rush from one meeting to the next, have too many emails to answer on any given day. There are moments when it seems all we do is fly by the seat of our pants. Yes, every aspect of our work rhythms conspires to throw us off-center! Staying grounded feels like the impossible dream. 
         <br>
         <br>I used to train actors. Have you ever wondered how an actor manages to be in the right frame of mind when the camera says “action?” How she accomplishes this amidst the relentless hustle and bustle of a movie set? Actors study the art of being in the optimal state of mind. Well, you are the actor in your own life, and your life will unfold with more grace the moment you master some of the same skills. We tend to call them anchoring techniques. 
         <br>
         <br>Here are a few of my favorites. Beware – what works well for one person will not work as well for another. Part of your homework is to experiment and discover the technique that “does it” for you! 
         <ul>
          <li><b>Self-Talk:</b> <br><br>Affirmations have become the stuff of satire. I just watched an episode of the TV show “Two Broke Girls” in which the heroines hurl affirmations at each other with a sarcastic sense of glee. Too bad. To the cynic, an affirmation may seem too good to be true. Truth is, when you find an affirmation that works for you, the result DOES feel too good to be true! <br><br>Here’s a phrase I use when I’m about to enter a meeting and feel anxious (and being anxious is not helpful). When I feel tired (and showing up tired is not an option): <i>I am a vibrant vehicle of light and love</i>. <br><br>The three key words – <i>vibrant, light, love</i> – are high energy words for me. They resonate deeply. If you haven’t worked with self-talk before, this is what I want you to get: <br><br><i>This little phrase works for me, every time. It shifts my energy, every time. I repeat it to myself, quietly, for about 30 seconds. Combined with a few deep breaths, it activates the cellular energy within me and around me that I am seeking to access.</i> <br><br>Do not use MY affirmation. Find the words that affirm YOUR highest good within you. Repeat them quietly. Instantly anchored!<br><br></li> 
          <li><b>Sensory Reprogramming:</b> <br><br>Mental worry tends to get us unhinged, and classic anchoring techniques shift us away from the mind, back into our optimal states of being. <br><br>If you’re a highly visual person, see yourself in a physical place where you feel serene. Visualize the sensory details of this place. Calm will return quickly. If you’re a highly auditory person, listen to a piece of music that soothes you or fires you up. <br><br>If you’re a highly kinesthetic person, take a few conscious breaths and adjust your posture. If you’re a spiritual person, saying a prayer or repeating a mantra will quickly reconnect you with your energy source.<br><br></li>
         </ul> This is common-sense stuff, but here’s the conundrum. An anchoring technique, applied with quiet commitment, invokes a powerful inner shift within 30 seconds. When we’re under pressure, the last thing we tend to think about is our anchoring technique. I urge you to discover the one or two techniques that “do it” for you, every time. Make them a daily habit. 
         <br>
         <br>And reap your anchoring rewards.

         <b>millions of people are negatively impacted by the inability of a person to connect appropriately and to be present</b>.” So much drama is created when we don’t know how to shift gears and become present. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781119111153.html"><i>5 Gears</i></a> offers an 
         <b>extremely valuable metaphor</b> for identifying which gear you are in and finding the right gear at the right time in order to connect fully with others. The model is a relationship-driven approach. It is values-driven and helps to counteract self-absorption. 
         <blockquote>
          The majority of people are not aware of their social awkwardness and give little time to thinking about what gear the other person is in while they are talking. 
          <br>
          <br>When a person’s agenda is the driving force of their life, then they are going to run over people most of the time unless they learn to use their brakes and downshift.
         </blockquote> What I like most about the 
         <b>5 Gears model</b> is 
         <b>first</b>, it gives you language to communicate which gear you are in to yourself and others, and to understand where others are at so that you can be more fully present. 
         <b>Second</b>, it helps you plan what gear you need to be in as you move through your day. And 
         <b>third</b>, it helps to be more self-aware and 
         <i>other</i>-aware.

         <br>Like shifting gears in a car, there is a right order and a right time for each gear. Life goes more smoothly when you are shifting through the gears at the right time—and avoiding getting stuck in any one gear.

         <br>
         <br>5th Gear is focus mode that allows us to “get in the zone” without interruption. It takes discipline to shut the door, turn off your email, and let people know that you are shifting into 5th gear, but it makes it possible to cruise at a sustained speed for a period of time. The caution is that when you get stuck in 5th gear you miss out on relationships, opportunities to add value, and events in life that matter in the long term.

         <br>
         <br>4th Gear is the task gear that allows us to work hard while also multitasking. Most of the time we operate in 4th Gear so we need to learn to use it well. Waking up in 4th Gear is not the best strategy for your life. Our tasks can begin to control our lives. (Do you normally check your e-mail when you first wake up?) We need to learn how to shift into it and how to shift out of it. They relate the observation of Elizabeth Paul as an example. How many of us are like this: 
         <blockquote>
          The personal story for me was realizing that as a woman I have “work” 4th and 5th gear and “domestic” 4th and 5th gear. I thought that because I was being disciplined about putting my devices away during the golden family window of 5 to 8 P.M. I wasn’t in 4th or 5th gear, 
          <b>when in reality I was just putting on a different task hat</b>. When my eyes were opened to that, I realized that I actually have little to no 3rd or 1st gear in my life at all. That was shocking.
         </blockquote> In other words, the other gears are not just another 4th Gear task. Each Gear requires a different mindset or approach to your time. If we learn to implement the other gears in our life we will find that our everyday, multitasking 4th gear will become more productive. 
         <br>

         <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>3rd Gear: Why Being Social Matters</b></font>
         <br>
         <br>3rd Gear is the social gear. 3rd gear is a mindset. It is the space between task-driven, hyper focused work and the no-work, relational connection of being with your family, spouse, or close friend. Type-As need to remember that business happens in 3rd gear—in relationships. 
         <b>If you are too important for small talk, you might want to study the chapter on 3rd Gear.</b> Of course you can get stuck in 3rd gear and overdo it. At the same time if you try to control social space it actually becomes a 4th Gear activity for you.

         <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000"><b>2nd Gear: Connecting Deeply</b></font>
         <br>
         <br>2nd Gear represents connecting with family, friends, or colleagues. Whether work colleagues, family, or friends, it is time geared toward relationship building without an agenda or pressure to be productive. Some of us have never really learned how to connect. It can’t be forced. It requires making time and learning to truly give of yourself to others. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>2nd Gear is a difficult gear to be in because we live in a 4th Gear world.</b> Kubicek writes that while writing this book consumed a lot of time, energy and mental thought, “it is still my responsibility to be the leader worth following in my home. Even with the pressure of a deadline, I still have to practice shifting.” He has found that being present in 2nd Gear leads to healthy relationships that bring peace to your mind and heart, fruitful growth between people, better conversations, likeability and trust, reestablished priorities, less drama and more security, social awareness and emotional intelligence.

         <br>
         <br>1st Gear represents being fully recharged. Do you know how to recharge? “If you figure out what 1st Gear feels like for you and discipline yourself to spend more time there, more power will flow through you. 
         <b>If you live and lead out of 20 percent battery life then you will never experience what you hope to experience.</b>” The recharging gear if different for all of us. What works for one may not work for another. But we need to find what works for us. Think about this statement: 
         <b>“Working from your rest, not rest from your work, is the goal.”</b> Note to self: “Crashing is not resting; it is actually just crashing.” It is simply stalling out. Truly healthy rest restores you.

         <br>
         <br>Reverse is the 
         <i>responsive</i> gear. It is used when we need to back up and start again or apologize. Too many people operate without a reverse gear. 
         <blockquote>
          There are two types of people—
          <b>responsive and resistant</b>. You hire responsive ones and fire the resistant. Responsive people are self-aware and have a consciousness that is not steeped in victim mentality, but rather responsibility. They understand that they are responsible for their actions and will make amends when they have clearly overstepped their bounds. Responsive people are the best employees, and spouses, and children. 
          <br>
          <br>Resistant people, on the other hand, are exhausting. Resistance is basically pride. Resistance will fight rather than resolve, blame rather than admit, and run away rather than run toward reconciliation.
         </blockquote> Are there any relationships you need to restore?

         <br>
         <br>After explaining the 5 gears, Kubicek and Cockram ask us to find our go-to gear. 
         <b>Where do we like to spend most of our time and what gear is the hardest for us to be in?</b> Learning how to improve on your hardest gears hold the keys to improving your influence in the lives of others. 
         <br>
         <br>Next you need to find the right time for each gear as you go through your day. There is a natural time for gears. Your mornings should not start in 4th Gear. 
         <b><i>Really!</i></b> When we are in the wrong gear at the wrong time we create disconnects. Shifting well is both an art and a science. 5 Gears offers some practical examples of leading your life intentionally and in the right gear at the right time. 
         <br>
         <br>I know this post is getting long, but let me leave you with an example of integrating the 5 Gears into your daily schedule: 
         <blockquote>
          6
          <small>A.M.</small>—Wake Time: 
          <i>1st Gear</i> 
          <br>7
          <small>A.M.</small>—Drive Time: 
          <i>1st or 4th Gear</i> 
          <br>8
          <small>A.M.</small>—Work Time: 
          <i>4th or 5th Gear</i> 
          <br>12 
          <small>Noon</small>—Lunchtime: 
          <i>3rd or 1st Gear</i> 
          <br>1
          <small>P.M.</small>—Work Time: 
          <i>4th or 5th Gear</i> 
          <br>5
          <small>P.M.</small>—Drive Time: 
          <i>4th or 1st Gear</i> 
          <br>6
          <small>P.M.</small>—Dinner Time: 
          <i>2nd or 3rd Gear</i> 
          <br>8
          <small>P.M.</small>—Social Time: 
          <i>3rd or 2nd or 1st Gear</i> 
          <br>10
          <small>P.M.</small>—Bedtime: 
          <i>1st Gear</i>

         </div>Marshall Goldsmith explains in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780804141239.html"><i>Triggers</i></a> the kinds of things in our environment that derail us from becoming the kind of leader, co-worker, parent, or spouse that we want to be. He illuminates an aspect of self-awareness that is so vital to a leader’s success. 
         <br>
         <br>We can’t control our environment, but we can control our responses. We always have a choice. 
         <br>
         <br>When it comes to interpersonal behavior we can’t rely on habits to help us. “We must be adaptable, not habitual—because the stakes are so much higher.” We need something more to help us deal with the uncertainty of our day. 
         <br>
         <br>When it comes to triggers, it’s not the big triggers that usually do us in, it is the little moments in life that trigger our most outsized and unproductive responses. They trigger some of our basest impulses. Especially with the people we know and love the most. “We can say and do anything with these folks. They know us. They’ll forgive us. We don’t have to edit ourselves. We can be true to our impulses. That’s how our closes relationships often become trigger festivals with consequences that we rarely see in any other part of our lives—the fuming and shouting, the fights and slammed doors, the angry departures and refusals to talk to each other for months, years, decades.” 
         <br>
         <br>So where the problem is most vivid is in the small, minor moments of the day, when we are not thinking about our environment or our behavior. That’s when we need to be most vigilant. 
         <br>
         <br>Sometimes the best strategy is to avoid the trigger altogether. Stop flirting with those things that tempt you. Goldsmith says that one of the most common behavioral issues among leaders is “succumbing to the temptation to exercise power when they would be better off showing restraint.” And that behavior is very hard to eliminate because those who engage in it because they no doubt enjoy doing it. 
         <br>
         <br>But we can’t always walk away. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#808000"><b>SOLUTION</b></font> 
         <br>
         <br>The solution then isn’t trying to fix the environment or the behavior of others, the solution is to change our behavior. When we are triggered we need to adjust. 
         <br>
         <br>Goldsmith has found that asking yourself some active questions works magic. Active questions get to personal responsibility—something you have control over. Goldsmith suggests six engaging questions anyone should be asking themselves each day to build engagement: 
         <br>
         <br>Did I do my best to set clear goals today? 
         <br>Did I do my best to make progress toward my goals today? 
         <br>Did I do my best to find meaning today? 
         <br>Did I do my best to be happy today? 
         <br>Did I do my best to build positive relationships today? 
         <br>Did I do my best to be fully engaged today? 
         <br>
         <br>In addition, Goldsmith has a number of other 
         <b>Daily Questions</b> he asks himself to gauge whether he had taken responsibility for his own life. Our own questions would reflect those things that we want to work on—will success on these items help me become the person I want to be? 
         <br>
         <br>Did I do my best to have a healthy diet? 
         <br>Did I do my best to be a good spouse? 
         <br>Did I do my best to add value to ______? 
         <br>Did I do my best to learn something new? 
         <br>Did I do my best to get a good night’s sleep? 
         <br>Did I do my best to not prove how right I am when it’s not really worth it? 
         <br>
         <br>You score yourself on a scale from 1 to 10 to track your progress or the lack of it. “One of the underappreciated benefits of the Daily Questions is that they force us to quantify an unfamiliar data point: Our level of trying. We rarely do that.” 
         <br>
         <br>Daily Questions remind us that success is the result of small efforts repeated consistently over time. Daily Questions can be a game changer because they reinforce our commitment, they ignite our motivation where we need it and not where we don’t, and they shrink our goals into manageable increments. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#808000"><b>OUR NEED FOR STRUCTURE</b></font> 
         <br>
         <br>The Daily Questions provide structure in our lives. Simply put, Goldsmith says: “
         <b>We do not get better without structure.</b>” Like rules, structure pushes us in the right direction when our first impulse is to go the other way. 
         <br>
         <br>Goldsmith has work with Alan Mulally and finds that “no idea looms bigger in Alan’s mind than the importance of structure in turning around and organization and its people.” Goldsmith explains how Mulally integrated the Daily Questions process in his weekly Business Plan Review meetings with his sixteen top executives. And repetition was key. “In the same way that Daily Questions drive us to measure our effort every day and then face the reality of our own behavior, the executives would be announcing how they graded themselves every Thursday—without deviation.” And in the group setting the idea was: How can we help one another more? 
         <br>
         <br>Structure “limits our options so that we’re not thrown off course by externalities….Imposing structure on parts of our day is how we seize control of our otherwise unruly environment.” 
         <br>
         <br>Goldsmith points out that after a hard, decision-filled day we become 
         <b><i>depleted</i></b>. Our discipline and decisiveness fade at the end of the day to the point where we want to do nothing or fill our time with mindless activities. 
         <br>
         <br>Deletion isn’t something that we are always aware of but we should anticipate it and create structure where we can. “If we provide ourselves with enough structure, we don’t need discipline. The structure provides it for us. We can’t structure everything obviously—no environment is 
         <i>that</i> cooperative.” But the more structure we have the less we have to worry about. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#808000"><b>ANTICIPATE</b></font> 
         <br>
         <br>When you know you are headed into a pointless meeting, imagine that you are going to be tested on your behavior: 
         <br>
         <br>Did I do my best to be happy? 
         <br>Did I do my best to find meaning? 
         <br>Did I do my best to build positive relationships? 
         <br>Did I do my best to be fully engaged? 
         <br>
         <br>Sometimes we think we have to show everyone how we feel but that’s ego talking. “Why waste that hour being disengaged and cynical?” asks Goldsmith. 
         <br>
         <br>It’s in the moment that we shape ourselves into a better person. Sometimes 
         <b>hourly questions</b> might help. When we face an event were not up for or a person that usually throws us off our game, why not try setting our Smartphone to ask us a question like, “Am I doing my best to…?” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#808000"><b>THE BEST PART</b></font> 
         <br>
         <br>What I like best about 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780804141239.html"><i>Triggers</i></a> is that by creating an awareness of our environment and identifying our own triggers we can be a force for adding value in other people’s lives by triggering something good in others. It requires our 
         <i>imagination</i> and 
         <i>clarity</i> about what we want to become. 
         <blockquote>
          When we dive all the way into adult behavioral change—with 100 percent focus and energy—we become an irresistible force rather than the proverbial immovable object. We begin to change our environment rather than be hanged by it. The people around us sense this. We have become the trigger.

         </div>As we navigate through life, 
         <b>we must be able to cooperate and compete</b>. Knowing what to do when is very important to getting where you want to go and to where you want to go next time. 
         <br>
         <br>In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780307720214.html"><i>Friend and Foe</i></a>, authors Adam Galinsky and Maurice Schweitzer, state that all of our relationships are both cooperative and competitive and we get more out of life when we learn to find the right balance between acting as a friend and acting as a foe. 
         <br>
         <br>Drawing on interdisciplinary studies, they show how to manage social comparisons (We crave comparisons because we like to know how we’re doing compared to the people around us.), get and keep power, how to get others to put their trust in you and what to do when you lose it, the art of seeking another perspective, negotiating, when it’s best to go last and when it’s best to go first, and finishing every interaction well. 
         <br>
         <br>When it comes to 
         <b>power</b>, it’s not so much how powerful we are, but how powerful we 
         <i>feel</i> that determines how think and act. Whether you have it or feel it, power makes us more focused on our own vantage point and oblivious to the perspective of others. The key to keeping our power is being able to see the world through the perspectives of others. 
         <br>
         <br>There is an acceptable range of power that you can display relative to your actual power. Exceed it and you will be ostracized. You also need to find the right balance between being confident and deferential. It’s usually a lack of deference rather than excess of confidence that get powerful people into trouble. 
         <br>
         <br>Interestingly, they say 
         <b>we crave hierarchy</b> because it helps to manage the tension between cooperation and in competition. 
         <br>
         <br>Hierarchy provides a means for solving the question of how we distribute scarce resources. It also facilitates coordination. Studies demonstrate that co-leadership usually doesn’t work. “Co-leadership can kill both ideas and people, because it creates uncertainty over who is really in charge. Of course, co-led teams are not always ineffective and dangerous. But when there is not clear division of labor among these leaders, coordination becomes difficult, patterns of deference can disappear, and conflict can erupt.” 
         <br>
         <br>Hierarchy is less useful the more human the task or the more cognitively complex—more thought than any one person can attend to. Why? “Because to make the best complex decisions, we need to tap ideas from all the rungs of the hierarchical ladder and learn from everyone who has relevant knowledge to share.” Steve Jobs said, “You have to run by ideas, not hierarchy.” 
         <br>
         <br>But here is an interesting find. When over 30,000 Himalayan mountain climbers were analyzed, they found that members of 
         <b>expeditions from more hierarchical countries were more likely to die on the expedition</b> because in countries and cultures that are hierarchical, decision-making tends to be a top-down process. These expedition members are less likely to speak up and less likely to alert leaders to changing conditions and impending problems. 
         <br>
         <br>They say that 
         <b>asking for advice</b> does more than turn adversaries into advocates. “It can also help you supercharge your advocates and lead them to help you climb up the corporate ladder.” And when you don’t take their advice you need to explain that even though you didn’t take their advice it gave you a unique perspective and insight that lead to your success. Always follow up with your advice givers. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780307720214.html"><i>Friend and Foe</i></a> is a very interesting read and full of useful advice and insights to help you get along and get ahead. It will go a long way to developing the awareness that is essential to leadership. 
         <br>
         <br>No matter what happens, it your interaction ends well people will tend to remember it well. More importantly, it sets the stage for anything that comes next.

         <h2 class="title">What Are Your Hidden Strengths?</h2> Your strengths will get you in the door, but to make progress you are going to have to become more of who you are and draw on your hidden strengths. 
         <br>
         <br>Hidden strengths are not weaknesses. They are capacities you have that have yet to be recognized, developed and utilized. They become your Learned Strengths. 
         <br>
         <br>Your strengths and weaknesses need to be managed. Strengths need to be managed so that they are not overused or overbearing. Weaknesses need to be managed so that they don’t derail you. Often they can be delegated. But the area between the two—your hidden strengths—not only provide a deep pool of strengths to draw on but they will help you to smooth out your rough edges and bring into balance your natural strengths. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">

         </div> 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781626562837.html"><i>Hidden Strengths</i></a>, authors Thuy and Milo Sindell have identified 28 skills in four categories and made available a 
         <b>free</b> 
         <i>Hidden Strengths Assessment</i> at 
         <a href="http://hiddenstrengths.com/" title="HiddenStrengths.com" target="_blank">HiddenStrengths.com</a>. The four categories are: Leading Self, Leading Others, Leading the Organization, and Leading Implementation. 
         <br>
         <br>Once you have identified your hidden strengths you can identify areas to focus on developing that would nullify a weakness or contribute to your success without directly attacking areas where you struggle. For example, Barry lacked 
         <i>emotional control</i> and it was hurting his leadership capacity. He did have hidden strengths in the areas of 
         <i>resilience</i> and 
         <i>flexibility</i>. So instead of attacking his weakness, he developed his 
         <i>resilience</i> and 
         <i>flexibility</i>. In doing so he did not get so fired up that he lost control of his emotions. The authors note that “if he prepared ahead of time for meetings by formulating his ideas and alternatives, it make him more flexible when he listened to others’ ideas, and everyone would feel heard and understood.” 
         <br>
         <br>You are more than what naturally comes to you. There is much more that can be developed. “With awareness and dedication, you can leverage these Hidden Strengths to continually reach new levels of performance and success.”

          <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/LeadingForum.jpg" width="100" height="115" alt="Leading Forum">
         </div> Leaders work on a spectrum of effectiveness and the continuum varies with the ups and downs of your work’s natural rhythms. When you are in a good place, with available margin to deal with your load, you take a balanced approach to meeting your demands, use your strengths wisely, and sustain the capacity to manage well against the challenges of the day. Let’s call this the 
         <i>Performance Zone</i>, which is the place you need to be. 
         <br>
         <br>As you confront our day-to-day demands from this place, you are more likely to be: response-driven, multidimensional, flexible, proactive, and engaged. However, when your margin runs low and the inverse equation of shrinking resources and increasing demands stresses our capacity to the breaking point, the strain can tilt you away from the 
         <i>Performance Zone</i> and push you out into the weeds toward the 
         <i>Danger Zone</i>. In this overwhelmed place, it’s easy to get into a reactionary mode where priorities get blurred by the fatigue of doing more with less. 
         <br>
         <br>The bottom line is that 
         <b>you can’t lead if you’re lost</b>. To know whether your demands are pushing you out of the 
         <i>Performance Zone</i>, consider each of the following questions and answer with either “Yes” or “No” depending on whether the statement is true for you: 
         <ol>
          <li>Have the demands on you increased over the past several months?</li> 
          <li>Are they likely to stay elevated and/or continue rising?</li> 
          <li>If your demands have increased, have you gained enough additional time, energy, resources, and focus to adequately address them?</li>
         </ol> If you answered “Yes,” “Yes,” and “No” to these questions then you are tilting toward the 
         <i>Danger Zone</i> and at risk of getting stuck in what I call 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781137485793.html" title="Managers Dilemma" target="_blank"><i>The Manager’s Dilemma</i></a>. To know if you’re already stuck in the dilemma's grip, listen to the way you talk about your own work. The emergence of paradoxical statements like the following is the first sign that the manager’s dilemma is settling into your atmosphere: 
         <ul>
          <li><i>"I can’t afford to relax because things are too busy right now."</i></li> 
          <li><i>"With so many deadlines and demands, some priorities will have to be sacrificed."</i></li> 
          <li><i>"It’s too crazy now; I’ll focus better once things settle down."</i></li>
         </ul> From the outside looking in, you can see how backward statements like these actually are. If a friend said something like this to you, it would be easy to point out the flaw in their logic and show them how the undoubtedly counterproductive behaviors stemming from these attitudes will leave them more deeply entrenched in their dilemma. However, when it comes to our own situations, we’re too close to and too tangled up in them to maintain this level of objectivity. 
         <br>
         <br>When we are stuck in our own dilemmas, we somehow start believing that this is how work has to be. 
         <b>Over time, the cumulative effect of this way of thinking and working leaves us feeling like there is truly no way out.</b> What was easy is now difficult. What was enjoyable is now unsatisfying. What used to give us a sense of purpose now seems unimportant. 
         <br>
         <br>The good news is that you can get yourself out of the weeds and back on track – even when you cannot change the responsibilities you face. It turns out that the dilemma’s triggers are swinging doors and within each one there is an alternative path that acts as an escape hatch. 
         <b>To exit the dilemma, you have to go out the way you came in:</b> 
         <ol>
          <li>It turns us around and distorts our values and goals, so <i>determine your line of sight</i> to focus on the right priorities.</li> 
          <li>It spins our wheels, causing extra effort with less effectiveness, so <i>distinguish your contribution</i> to make a deeper impact.</li> 
          <li>It punctures leaks in our already fragile time, energy, resources, and focus, so <i>plug the leaks</i> to restore your capacity.</li> 
          <li>It limits our ability to use everyday obstacles for good, so <i>convert your challenges to fuel</i> and turn the tables on the dilemma.</li>
         </ol> Together, these four drivers and related responses can change the way you work.

         <h2 class="title">Is it Time to Disrupt You?</h2> “I was presenting myself to the world as an out-of-shape, intimidated middle-aged man. That needed to change,” writes Jay Samit. 
         <br>
         <br>Disruption can be a powerful and positive force. If we are to work with and take advantage of the disruptions in the world around us, 
         <b>we must be willing to disrupt ourselves</b>. 
         <br>
         <br> 
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781250059376.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781250059376sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div>
         <b>All disruption,</b> says Samit in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781250059376.html"><i>Disrupt You!</i></a>, 
         <b>begins with introspection</b>. After an early failure he began a process of self-disruption. “I analyzed all the pieces that came together to form my identity. I began to define what unique experiences and knowledge I had that would set me apart from my peers. I thought about the way I made decisions, how I processed and responded to information, how I approached problems. I thought about the way I presented myself to the world and how I communicated my abilities to potential business partners and clients. And I thought about how I was sending my time and energy. If I was going to find opportunities to make a name for myself in the world, I was going to have to change something in my approach.” 
         <br>
         <br>This a lot to tackle, but it is a process we all need to face. It can be very difficult to confront our assumptions about ourselves and the world around us to create a reimagined self. It is difficult to upend what we have built—our identity and approach—in exchange for a better future. It’s unknown. We are often more comfortable with what we have always done—even if it is not working for us—than we are moving into unchartered territory. 
         <br>
         <br>Like any business we also have a 
         <i>value chain</i>—our identities. Any or all of these links may need to be disrupted. You might think of 
         <b>research and development</b> as the way we interpret the world. Where do I thrive? What kind of people do I work with best? What do I believe about myself that might not be true? 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Production and design</b> are the ways in which you respond to problems. Do I tackle problems with an open mind, thinking holistically? Your reactions to disruptions in your environment will depend on your mind-set. 
         <br>
         <br>The next link relates to how you 
         <b>market and sell</b> your potential. Not what you have done, but what you can do. Success says Samit, is about defining your future. About his own marketing and sales links he writes: 
         <blockquote>
          We market and sell ourselves in the ways we present ourselves to the world, which are based on what we see as our personal strengths or limitations. We distribute ourselves in the ways we choose to spend our time and where we focus our energies. When viewed from this framework, the process of self-transformation becomes approachable: you need only analyze each link in your internal value chain and find the single link that’s holding you back. Then make changes to that link to disrupt yourself.
         </blockquote> Finally, 
         <b>distribution</b> is how we spend your time and where we direct our focus. Do I devote my time and energy to achieving my dreams, or am I surfing the Internet every evening? Our time and energy is a valuable resource, we must distribute it wisely. 
         <br>
         <br>Self-disruption is about making deliberate choices rather than running on autopilot. It’s about making preemptive moves rather than just being a pawn in a game. 
         <br>
         <br>Samit provides 
         <i>Disruptor’s Map</i> in each of these areas to help you begin disrupting yourself before you are disrupted. Consider where you are and where you want to be. And don’t forget to ask yourself what you want to do along the way personally and professionally. Both are critical areas to consider. 
         <br>
         <br>Self-disruption can prepare us for the future and the disruptions it will bring. 
         <br>
         <br>Every disruption brings about opportunities. By analyzing the value chain you can find new ways to capture value. “The real challenge,” says Samit, “is for each of us to determine where we feel we can make the most impact.”

         </div> Bernard Roth, one of the founders of the multi-disciplinary 
         <i>d.school</i> at Stanford University, has written a book titled, 
         <i>The Achievement Habit</i>. However, it is much more than the title might let on. 
         <br>
         <br>It’s about how you can achieve your goals more fully and faster by expanding your limited view of reality. It’s about design thinking applied to every aspect of your life. It’s about assisting us to break through the walls that are mostly of our own making. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>You Give Everything Its Meaning</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Roth begins by reminding us that 
         <b>nothing has any meaning except for the meaning that we give it</b>. “Stop labeling things in their usual way. Make the familiar into the unfamiliar, and the result can be amazing and delightful, as opposed to dull, nonfunctional, and ordinary.” Along these same lines, this applies to our 
         <b><i>need to be right</i></b>. “Next time you find yourself playing right and wrong, remember: You give everything in your life its meaning, so you can choose to end the game. It does not matter how right you are or how wrong they are; you lose just by playing.” You have the power to change your attitude and therefore, how you will play the game. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Reasons Are Excuses</b> 
         <br>
         <br>And then there are all the reasons we have for why something is or isn’t happening. They’re really just excuses prettied up says Roth. He was chronically late until he decided to stop coming up with reasons and deal with the real issue. Here’s the 
         <b>key point</b>: We use reasons “to hide shortcomings from ourselves. When we stop using reasons to justify ourselves, we increase our chances of changing behavior, gaining a realistic self-image, and living a more satisfying and productive life.” In other words, we take responsibility for our life. 
         <br>
         <br>We often 
         <b>get stuck because we are working on the wrong issue</b>. We have some faulty assumptions. “Experience has shown me that one of the main causes of losing sleep over a problem is that we think we are dealing with a question when in fact we are dealing with an answer (a solution) that turns out 
         <b><i>not</i></b> to be a good fit to our actual problem.” Letting go of the problem is often the best solution. Roth shows you how to rework your question to find the actual issue. 
         <br>
         <br>At the d.school there is a 
         <i>bias toward action</i>. Failure is part of the expected result. In reaching our goals we also need to watch our language because it influences the way we see things (and the way others see us too). The word 
         <i>but</i> creates conflict. Using the word 
         <i>and</i> opens up the conversation. Change “I have to” to “I want to.” It clarifies the fact that we have a choice in the matter. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Don’t Interrupt</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Here’s a ego taxing communication tip: Don’t interrupt. “Many people interrupt because they have something that they are afraid they might forget or that it will not be relevant later. The best thing to do is to let it go. If it is still appropriate at the end, say it then. If it gets lost and remains unspoken—no matter how brilliant it would have been—the world will not notice.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Flat Organization</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Roth describes the 
         <b>flat organization</b> of the d.school over the last forty years. Why and how it works. With a common goal and purpose, I think what Roth describes is possible: “We operated by consensus and negotiation, almost never voting on anything. There was almost no acrimony, and people treated each other with respect, collegiality, and a spirit of shared purpose and commitment.” “We were all in charge, and we wanted to make it work.” If you can overcome your biases, “you might find a management structure that strongly supports what you want to accomplish.” 
         <br>
         <br>Many more topics from designing work spaces to self-image are discussed. All of it valuable. Each concept is followed by a “Your Turn” section to give you tools and techniques to apply these ideas to your own situation. 
         <blockquote>
          When you hold yourself in high esteem and keep a positive outlook on your future, other will usually follow suit. By choosing the meaning we give to people and things in our environment, ultimately we control our own experiences, not matter what work we are doing.
         </blockquote>

         <br>
         <br>An athlete steps up to the starting blocks in the Olympic stadium. They stand tall, take a few deep breaths, and shake out their muscles. Thousands of people cheer while they are introduced, but their eyes never waver from the lane they’re about to run down. When the gun goes off, they explode into high performance action. 
         <br>
         <br>How can we apply this scenario to a business situation? The same techniques that athletes use to perform under pressure allow business leaders to excel in the workplace. Here are five top practices that will improve your health and performance both at the office. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>1. The Power Pose.</b> Before competition, athletes often stand tall with their shoulders back and head up. Adopting certain postures improve performance by changing the levels of hormones in your body. Recent research by Dr. Amy Cuddy from the Harvard Business School has shown that adopting a “Power Pose” increases testosterone levels, which is a repair and regenerate hormone, and lowers cortisol, which is a stress hormone. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>2. Relaxation Breathing.</b> Stress and tension undermine performance and contribute to the development of chronic, stress-related illnesses. Taking a few deep relaxing breaths and exhaling slowly can dramatically change your psychological state and boost performance. Pause and take a few deep relaxing breaths to regain control of both body and mind. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>3. Focus.</b> In sports, it’s obvious that staying focused is critical for success. Physiological science tells us that humans simply can’t focus on multiple things at the same time. We live in the age of distraction, bombarded by emails, social media and text messages all day long. To perform at your best, it is critical to find time each day to focus exclusively on only the most important projects and tasks. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>4. Hydrate properly.</b> Athletes know how fundamental water is to their performance. A dehydrated body and brain are sluggish on the track and in the office. Caffeine is great in moderation – one or two cups of coffee per day, ideally 30 minutes before a mental energy boost is required. Other than that, it’s water all the way to maintain focus and stamina. And plenty of it. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>5. Be 1% Better.</b> An athlete who delivers an incredible performance in the playoffs is showing the result of thousands of hours of practice. We can do the same thing with our food, sleep, exercise, thinking and work. Strive to be 1% better each day. A 1% change might not seem like much, but those small daily improvements amplify your life. It’s like earning compound interest for your body and mind. 
         <br>
         <br>We can all learn from elite performers in any discipline, even areas quite different from our own. Do you have any techniques that you use to perform at your absolute best?

         <h2 class="title">Return on Character</h2> We live in an age where wisdom is only wisdom if it is supported by numbers. 
         <br>
         <br>There are two obvious problems with this. First, we miss a lot because we are looking for immediate return. And so it puts our focus on the wrong things. And secondly, as a result, we tend to assign value to things in terms of numbers. It is assumed that if it gives us the best numbers, it must be the best choice or behavior. Nevertheless, it is satisfying when the numbers do add up. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781625271303.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781625271303sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div>In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781625271303.html"><i>Return on Character</i></a>, Fred Kiel has put numbers to the notion that good leadership aimed at promoting the common good, not just individual, winner-take-all acquisition can be good business. 
         <br>
         <br>In a seven year study of 121 CEOs they found that highly principled CEOs—
         <b><i>Virtuoso CEOs</i></b>—achieved nearly five times the return on assets that leaders whose character scores were the lowest—
         <b><i>Self-Focused CEOs</i></b>—in the study. Also encouraging is the fact that people demonstrate character through habitual behaviors and therefore anyone can learn habits of good character an unlearn habits of poor character. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Character is defined</b> in this study as “an individual’s unique combination of internalized beliefs and moral habits that motivate and shape how that individual relates to others.” Our character is what we believe. Despite what we say. Our leadership is what we what we do for (or to) others as a result of what we believe. 
         <br>
         <br>To assess character traits Kiel defined 
         <b>four keystone characters traits</b> that supported that definition: 
         <b>integrity</b> (telling the truth, acting consistently), 
         <b>responsibility</b> (admitting mistakes, concern for common good), 
         <b>forgiveness</b> (letting go of mistakes of others and ourselves, focusing on what’s right) and 
         <b>compassion</b> (empathizing with and empowering others, caring for others, committed to others’ development). 
         <br>
         <br>Not surprisingly, 
         <b>self-awareness is a key issue</b> in character development. The Virtuoso leaders rated themselves quite accurately. However, the Self-Focused leaders rated themselves as high as the Virtuoso leaders. Clearly, we have issues seeing ourselves as we are. 
         <blockquote>
          Perhaps the most important fact revealed by these interviews was whether the leaders knew their life story. Could they provide a coherent narrative about their past, touching on a number of major events, both positive and negative, and including a reasonable description of the effect those events had on their personal development? 
          <br>
          <br>The Self-focused leaders seem to have had very little opportunity to construct a meaningful platform of beliefs or principles. 
          <br>
          <br>As a result, they lack the foundation of supportive relationships, character habits, self-awareness, and mental complexity upon which to build the kind of character-driven leadership that reliably contributes to sound decision making and strong, sustainable business results.
         </blockquote> Virtuoso leaders also had the disciplined decision making skills that resulted in clearer organizational vision, more focused strategies, a higher-performing executive team, and a stronger culture of accountability. 
         <br>
         <br>The good news is we can all improve our character—even Virtuoso leaders. Kiel outlines 
         <b>six steps in the personal change process</b>. Step one is probably the most difficult and the key to the whole process. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Step 1: Acknowledge Invitations to Change.</b> “Being confronted with an undeniable truth about the way others perceive our behavior and character is a gift.”And that usually doesn’t come in the form we would want it. (If there is such a way!) “No matter what their source, all invitations to change share one thing in common: they make you aware that your current understanding of the world is inadequate, that you have encountered the limits of your level of personal integration. Your existing worldview, your level of mental complexity, or your ability to act in a way that reflects your core values and principles is no longer working, and you have to find a new way forward.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Step 2: Discover What You Want to Change.</b> Understanding exactly what habit you need to change is not always apparent. It requires some self-examination and quite possibly some outside help for some additional feedback. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Step 3: Find the Fuel for Change.</b> The resolve to make changes is made easier if you connect it to a visionary goal. “I want to be thought of as…” What result do you desire? 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Step 4: Identify the Keystone Change.</b> What change will contribute the most to your character development? Often a single new habit will bring about other positive character adjustments. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Step 5: Disarm Your Security System.</b> Any change will make you uncomfortable. You have to be okay with that. Disarming your brain’s instinctive resistance to change “requires that you face the assumptions that rigger your unwanted responses and behaviors and the true outcomes they produce for you.” Create an action plan. “I will do this when…” This help you to avoid your automatic responses you are trying to change. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Step 6: Rewire Your Brain.</b> As your new patterns of behavior seem secure, celebrate your progress. 
         <br>
         <br>It is not easy to become a Virtuoso leader in a world looking for loopholes. But 
         <i>Return on Character</i> demonstrates that the payoff is there.

         </div> Self-made billionaires think differently than most of us do. 
         <br>
         <br>Most of us think like what authors John Sviokla and Mitch Cohen call 
         <b><i>Performers</i></b> because their success is tracked through performance. They excel at optimizing within known systems. They strive to excel in well-defined areas, and are important to any organization – in fact, they are important to the self-made billionaire. 
         <br>
         <br>Self-made billionaires have what the authors call the 
         <b><i>Producer</i></b> mind-set. They thrive in uncertainty. Producers are critical to any company looking to create massive value because they redefine what’s possible, rather than simply meeting preexisting goals and standards. Combining sound judgment with imaginative vision, Producers think up entirely new products, services, strategies, and business models. 
         <br>
         <br>For 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781591847632.html"><i>The Self-Made Billionaire Effect</i></a>, they interviewed 120 billionaires and found that they had in common five habits of mind. What is interesting is that most organizations weed out the very people that they need to create massive value. Imagine what Atari might have achieved if Steve Jobs had stayed there to develop the first mass market personal computer. 
         <br>
         <br>Self-made billionaires are able to integrate ideas and actions that most individuals and organizations keep separate or even hold in direct tension to one another. Self-made billionaires effectively operate in a world of dualities—they seamlessly hold on to multiple ideas, multiple perspectives, and multiple scales. Here are the five critical dualities that they observed with additional thoughts on each: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Empathetic Imagination</b> 
         <br>Producers billion-dollar ideas come through the marriage of extreme empathy for the customer’s needs and wants, and an imaginative mind-set that allows him or her to come up with and explore new, untested ideas. 
         <blockquote>
          Focusing on the competencies of today is exactly what causes companies to get stuck in the markets they serve and the products they deliver now, with little eye for the shifts and innovation they will need for tomorrow. Sometimes it takes a slight twist in perspective to see opportunities through a different lens. 
          <br>
          <br>Steve Case said that his experience at Williams College—a top liberal arts college—was a kind of laboratory for imaginative thinking. “Liberal arts education is important particularly in a world that’s changing rapidly, because there is a lot of fluidity. There’s the melding of different perspectives, having a sense of things and having a sense of how to learn about things and to look for connections.”
         </blockquote> 
         <br>
         <b>Patient Urgency</b> 
         <br>Producers urgently prepare to seize an opportunity but patiently wait for that opportunity to fully emerge. 
         <blockquote>
          Producers are willing to operate simultaneously at multiple speeds and time frames. 
          <br>
          <br>Patient time spent waiting for an idea to mature is not the same as idle time. They’ll wait for the time to be right, but they will prepare relentlessly so that they are ready to jump on the opportunity when it arrives. 
          <br>
          <br>They don’t go off track planning for the next stage before they have capitalized on the present.
         </blockquote> 
         <br>
         <b>Inventive Execution</b> 
         <br>Producers approach execution of their ideas with the same integrative, inventive mind-set they applied to come up with a billion-dollar idea in the first place. Inventive freedom allows them to design aspects of the customer experience that outsiders consider fixed, thus unlocking new value. 
         <blockquote>
          Producers frequently operate in markets that require them to rethink the fundamentals of product or business design in order to deliver at scale.
         </blockquote> 
         <br>
         <b>Taking a Relative View of Risk</b> 
         <br>Self-made billionaires are not huge risk takers. Their perceptions of risks are relative: they are far less concerned about losing what they have than of not being part of a bigger future. 
         <blockquote>
          What Producers are not willing to risk is the chance to capture an opportunity. This dynamic creates a critical duality between the 
          <i>right</i> kind of risk and the resilience needed to do it all over again when the original plan doesn’t work out. 
          <br>
          <br>They invest bog, but they often have a parallel spring of income or safe source of cash they can count on to keep them solvent while they work the more exciting high-stakes opportunities.
         </blockquote> 
         <br>
         <b>Leadership Partnership</b> 
         <br>Producer overwhelmingly do not go it alone. Creating billions in value requires both a master Producer, who can bring together divergent ideas and resources into a blockbuster product design, and a virtuoso Performer, who can apply his or her creative acumen to optimizing the potential of that design. 
         <blockquote>
          Creating billions in value requires both: the Producer’s ability to bring together divergent ideas and resources into a blockbuster concept and inventive design, 
          <i>and</i> the Performer’s ability to follow through on details needed to make the business work.
         </blockquote> 
         <br>Why don’t organizations hold on to extraordinarily talented people? These Producers? 
         <br>
         <br>Here’s the thing: while we can all get behind these attitudes of mind, organizationally we don’t generally reward these traits. We recognize and reward Performers. They get the raises and promotions largely because their easy to recognize. They fit in; they can hit the ground running. Producers on the other hand don’t always fit because they think differently from those around them. “The ideas they propose move against the standard approach you are following, and that friction is what you need to achieve breakthrough value.” That makes us uncomfortable. As a result we tend to drive Producers away or cause them to just give up. 
         <br>
         <br>need both types, but when looking for new employees we need to look for more people whose background hints at looking at things differently. People who have started something new. People with the raw imagination to see something new and the fortitude necessary to work through the difficulty of execution. 
         <br>
         <br>“The key imperative for management is to differentiate between opportunities that need a Performer and those that need a Producer. Look at areas of achievement for the business and at who did the work. When it is a Producer, recognize that and give that Producer her next Producer-appropriate challenge.” 
         <br>
         <br>As leaders we need to accept both Producers and Performers and reject neither. We need to find and support positive deviance while promoting for systematic improvement.

         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781476711713.html"><i>The 5 Choices</i></a> is a nuts and bolts solution to greater productivity. 
         <br>
         <br>Ironically, while we live in a time of unprecedented opportunity, we spend almost half—40%—of our time attention and energy on unimportant or irrelevant activities almost insuring that we miss the possibilities all around us. Not only does that leave us feeling empty, but we end the day uncertain that we’ve accomplished what we needed to, worry about things left undone, and end up dreading the day ahead. 
         <br>
         <br>The authors, Kory Kogon, Adam Merrill, and Leena Rinne, say that the biggest hidden cost in our organizations is people spending their time, attention, and energy on things that don’t drive your most important results. 
         <br>
         <br>To improve the situation we have 
         <b>five choices to make in three areas</b>: 
         <i>Decision Management, Attention Management, and Energy Management</i>. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/The5Choices.gif" width="500" height="370" alt="5 Choices"> 
         <br>
         <b>The 5 Choices are:</b> 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/arrowheadl.gif" width="7" height="9" border="0"> 
         <b>Choice 1: Act on the Important, Don’t React to the Urgent</b> 
         <br>What is my return on this moment? This is really the foundational choice to make. “In today’s world, we can’t just go on the ‘I have a busy life’ autopilot and expect to end up where we want to be.” The authors have offered a Time Matrix model to help us make good decisions about where we spend our time, attention, and energy. Too often we get caught up in Quadrant 4 spending time (or too much time) on the trivial things that contribute nothing to our life. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/5ChoicesTimeMatrix.gif" width="300" height="300" alt="Time Matrix" align="right">
         <i><b>Q1:</b> The Quadrant of Necessity.</i> “These are things that need to be done now and, if not done, could have serious consequences. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i><b>Q3:</b> The Quadrant of Distraction.</i> These are activities marked as urgent that feel like they need to be done now, but there are no serious consequences if you don’t do them. “Many people spend a lot of time in Q3 thinking they’re in Q1. However, they’re just reacting to everything coming their way. They are confusing motion with progress, action with accomplishment.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i><b>Q4:</b> The Quadrant of Waste.</i> These are activities that are neither urgent nor important. When we get burned out we often go here for escape. “When we spend a lot of time in Q4, we feel lethargic and aimless. If we stay too long, we can experience depression and even despair.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i><b>Q2:</b> The Quadrant of Extraordinary Productivity</i>. These are that activities that will make a real difference in terms of accomplishment and results like proactive work, achieving high-impact goals, creative thinking, planning, prevention, relationship building, learning, and renewal. But you have to make a conscious choice to operate in this quadrant. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/arrowheadl.gif" width="7" height="9" border="0"> 
         <b>Choice 2: Go for Extraordinary, Don’t Settle for Ordinary</b> 
         <br>Most people don’t clarify what is important to them so they never spend the time working on those things. Identify your roles. “Roles are where life happens. It’s where we build relationships, where all the activities that make us human go on.” Craft a role statement for each role. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/arrowheadl.gif" width="7" height="9" border="0"> 
         <b>Choice 3: Schedule the Big Rocks, Don’t Sort Gravel</b> 
         <br>“In today’s environment, the key to true productivity is not to get more things done, but to get the right things done—the important things—with the highest quality you can achieve. 
         <b>It’s not about doing more with less, but doing more <i>about</i> less.</b>” Plan and decide when. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/arrowheadl.gif" width="7" height="9" border="0"> 
         <b>Choice 4: Rule Your Technology, Don’t let it Rule You</b> 
         <br>There are basically four types of information you need to mange: Appointments (Things you need to do at specific times), Tasks (Things you need to do that are not yet scheduled), Contacts (Information about people you interact with), and Notes or Documents (Other information you want to keep track of that does not fall into one of the other three categories). Organize accordingly. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/arrowheadl.gif" width="7" height="9" border="0"> 
         <b>Choice 5: Fuel Your Fire, Don’t Burn Out</b> 
         <br>Constant stress, poor diet, lack of exercise and sleep lead to burnout. The five energy drivers are adequate movement, proper diet, sleep, relaxation, and positive social connections. Your brain is your number-one asset in a knowledge-work world. Fuel it properly.

         <br>
         <br>If a behavior or thinking has gotten us by, we just keep repeating it even if it really isn’t serving us well. We won’t take another look at our underlying assumptions until it lands us in a crisis. Typically, until we are uncomfortable, we don’t see the need to do anything different. We just keep repeating what we know until it’s too late. Staying within our comfort zone limits us. 
         <br>
         <br>And here’s the thing, we can put ourselves into an uncomfortable position, or in time, it will be thrust upon us—and not on our terms. 
         <b>Every time we avoid the opportunity to grow, the stakes get higher.</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Discomfort motivates us to change, to explore, to seek out new answers. It spurs on creativity. It gives us confidence. We need to learn to 
         <i>systematically</i> reassess what we are doing and look for alternatives to the way we do what we do. 
         <br>
         <br>Real growth happens when we go into the unknown knowing that whatever happens, we will come out a different person—even a different organization. We will no longer think and act in the same way we did before. This expands our view. Provides us with new opportunities. Previously unseen solutions. 
         <br>
         <br>Richard Branson says, “If your vision is to reach a distant beach where, because of the reefs surrounding it, no one has ever set foot, then the chances are that reading the same old charts as everyone else has used isn’t going to get you there either.” 
         <br>
         <br>When it comes to leadership, we’ve been reading the same charts for too long. Running over the same old ground. We must develop the discipline to challenge—our beliefs, our assumptions, and our “tried and true” responses.

         </div>Michael Soupios and Panos Mourdoukoutas have reviewed the writings of the Classical philosophers and selected ten ideas that will positively impact our leadership effectiveness in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780814434673.html"><i>The Ten Golden Rules of Leadership</i></a>. Not surprisingly, the philosophies of classic figures remain relevant in today's workplace. 
         <br>
         <br>Early on the authors suggest that the raw material of leadership is 
         <i>not</i> latent in just about everyone and rightly discredit the idea that it “just takes a nudge to trigger its unfolding.” Further, they say that the “special qualities of genuine leadership are remarkably complex and rare.” It is true that good leaders are not as common as they need to be and that 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/leadology/" title="What is Leadership?" target="_blank">we do confuse</a> administration with actual leadership as they suggest, but the 
         <i><b>potential</b></i> is there in each one of us. The problem is that it 
         <b>remains latent in many of us</b>. We choose not to do the work necessary and instead assume reading “Leadership Lessons I Learned from My Cat” is enough to unlock our potential. 
         <br>
         <br>The authors do expose the real culprit at the end of the book: “Achieving the rank of genuine leader is a 
         <b>daunting task that most will find prohibitively challenging</b>.” In short, “leadership requires a special form of courage: the courage to fashion a code of conduct governed by principled conviction.” 
         <br>
         <br>Genuine leadership is not complex but it is difficult because it requires that we do the inner-work on a continual basis. And that is a lot to commit to. It’s lifelong. And what we want to do is to check it off and mark it as good enough. 
         <b>Sustainable leadership requires a radical life-long commitment to rule one of leadership: Know Thyself.</b> 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Rule 1: “Know Thyself.” –Thales</b> 
         <br>This is an intimidating task and one that many leaders never really get around to. It never seems as important as the task at hand. The larger issue though is that we all possess a “powerful tendency to obscure, distort, and fictionalize on behalf of a fabricated reality.” The authors note that “Knowing Thyself means bringing a fresh transparency to our hidden motives and identities.” They suggest that a would-be leader commit to “an agenda of spirited self-indictment.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Rule 2: “Office Shows the Person.” –Pittacus</b> 
         <br>Giving a person power reveals their inner qualities. “Specifically, power discloses whether or not a person has disposed if the psychological deficiencies that negate the possibility of real leadership.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Rule 3: “Nurture Community at the Workplace.” –Plato</b> 
         <br>Plato insisted that “there is no greater evil than discord and faction and no greater good than the bonds of communal sentiment.” The idea that if one part of the body suffers, we all suffer. “Foster a culture of cooperation and collaboration by defying the myth of the exceptional individual, and by explaining the corporate gains of working together.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Rule 4: “Do Not Waste Energy on Things You Cannot Change.” –Aristophanes</b> 
         <br>The Athenian playwright Aristophanes wrote in his play titled 
         <i>Peace</i>, “Never will you make the crab to walk straight.” Some things we cannot change. “Leaders must assume a posture of flexible response.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Rule 5: “Always Embrace the Truth.” –Antisthenes</b> 
         <br>Antisthenes wrote, “There are only two people who will tell you the truth about yourself—an enemy who has lost his temper and a friend who loves you dearly.” “Honest assessment is an essential requirement of effective leadership.” The problem is that the higher up the ladder you go, the less likely you will receive complete and accurate information.” Seek the truth. Hire a heretic. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Rule 6: “Let Competition Reveal Talent.” –Hesiod</b> 
         <br>Hesiod suggested that competition that releases selfishness is destructive, but competition that releases ingenuity and creativity is a constructive use of competition. Strife than is not the byproduct, but inner excellence and personal development. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Rule 7: “Live Life by a Higher Code.” –Aristotle</b> 
         <br>Aristotle wrote of the “magnanimous man” or the “great-souled” person. He is referring to a person that lives by a higher or more rigorous code than the average person, but not in a vain way. “When it comes to the great-souled individual, personal honor, not ego, is the ultimate priority and concern.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Rule 8: “Always Evaluate Information with a Critical Eye.” –The Skeptics</b> 
         <br>“Leaders should never assume that the information they receive is unsoiled by hidden agendas or political agendas.” The problem though is even more personal than that. Socrates reminded us that “we must be vigilant against the conceits of wisdom [and] that we are all strongly inclined to assume we understand things that in truth we fail to genuinely comprehend.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Rule 9: “Never Underestimate the Power of Personal Integrity.” –Sophocles</b> 
         <br>In the play 
         <i>Philoctetes</i> by Sophocles, one of the two central characters believes that the ends justify the means; “one should not allow moral concerns to impede the necessities of practical achievement.” In the face of this seductive idea, the other main character, Neoptolemus, responds, “I would prefer even to fail with honor than win by cheating.” It’s easy to rationalize wrong behavior. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Rule 10: “Character Is Destiny.” –Heraclitus</b> 
         <br>Our character or our moral essence determines the course of our lives. While we can’t control the world around us, “Heraclitus was correct to insist that we are, to a very great extent, the authors of both our own blessings and our own burdens.” “A well formed character,” write the authors, “is the priceless reward paid to those who have done the hard work of coming to know themselves.”

         <br>
         <br>John Baldoni, author of 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781629560212.html"><i>MOXIE</i></a>, says that “Leadership post-crash is not really any different from leadership pre-crash, except for one thing: resilience.” Leaders with moxie have 
         <b>four key attributes</b>: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Fire.</b> They have a passion for what they do and have a need to make a positive difference in the lives of others. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Drive.</b> They have ambition and want others to share in it. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Resilience.</b> They have known defeat and it doesn’t scare them. They know how to pick themselves up after a fall. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Street Smarts.</b> They know how the world works and what makes people tick. 
         <br>
         <br>Baldoni breaks moxie down into 
         <b>five characteristics</b> that you can practice and develop to be a leader that demonstrates moxie. Each characteristic is brought to life through the examples of leaders who have demonstrated it in their own life and leadership. 
         <br>
         <br>The first is 
         <b>Mindfulness</b>. “A mindful leader knows the situation as well as his capabilities and those of the people around him.” aware if his situation but at the same time focused on what could be done to improve it. Mindfulness “prepares leaders to focus on the present as well as prepare for the future”— to be aware of your situation but at the same time focused on what could be done to improve it. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/BaldoniMoxieCallout.gif" width="170" height="175" align="right" alt="opportunity">Second is 
         <b>Opportunity</b>. “An opportunistic leader looks for ways to make things better. She is motivated by a desire to make a positive difference.” That means a willingness to see beyond the immediate problem and see the possibilities over the horizon. 
         <br>
         <br>Third is 
         <b>X-Factor</b>. “A leader with the X-Factor has what we call ‘the right stuff of leadership.’ She radiates character and uses her ambition to focus on the right goals. She has the persevering spirit that radiates resolve. Leaders with the X-Factor are humble, and their humility attracts others to them.” The X-Factor is those things that allow you to do what you do well: character, beliefs and talent. These can all be examined and improved. In addition, look for opportunities to improve through more training and consider taking on responsibilities that stretch you. 
         <br>
         <br>Fourth is 
         <b>Innovation</b>. “An innovative leader knows that life is not lived in a linear fashion. Sometimes you need to take risks. That means thinking differently, doing differently, and rewarding others who do the same.” Leaders with moxie aren’t content with the status quo. They are tuned to the future. A “forward-themed outlook is not merely one of observation, it is one of application….That gives rise to innovation.” 
         <br>
         <br>Fifth is 
         <b>Engagement</b>. “Persons with moxie seek to engage with the wider community around them. They are focused on making a positive difference in their teams and in their organizations.” Leaders must work through others. “Engagement is an essential part of extending the leadership self in order to make a positive difference.” 
         <br>
         <br>All of us can demonstrate moxie when the going gets tough. Preparing and developing yourself now sets you up to make better decisions when you do get knocked down. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781629560212.html"><i>Moxie</i></a> is full of great stories and examples making it immediately relatable and practical. It is structured so that you can thoughtfully and tactically look at each of these areas to see where you can better prepare yourself. Baldoni also provides an appendix that works as a handbook to guide you in this. Questions, examples, additional thoughts and action steps help you access where you are at and what you might need to do next. 
         <br>
         <br>Moxie is not just about your work life, it also impacts every other aspect of your life and positively influences the lives of those you touch. 
         <br>

         <br>
         <br>On a summer Sunday night four years ago, I found myself standing in front of a roomful of about 80 corporate managers who probably didn’t want to be there. They had just finished the first week of a high-profile leadership development program in one of the world’s largest companies and week two was scheduled to start at 7:30 am the next morning. They were polite but understandably restless. I was there as a guest speaker brought in to share some of what I’d learned from working with several hundred other leaders in their company. 
         <br>
         <br>Since high-achieving people usually like to compare themselves to their peers, I asked if they’d like to see the summary results of hundreds of leadership behavior self-assessments completed by those other leaders. Of course they said yes. Starting with the highest assessed behaviors, everyone could quickly identify with commitment to behaviors like making timely decisions, being clear about priorities and accepting accountability for results. Then we took a look at the lowest assessed behaviors like pacing myself, taking regular time to step back and giving others my full presence and attention. There were nods and murmurs of recognition. I summed it up for the group with the headline, “Leaders in your company are so busy doing stuff that they probably don’t see what needs to be done. 
         <br>
         <br>Then the room erupted. Not in anger but in vociferous agreement. “Yeah, that’s exactly it!” one person exclaimed. “Yeah, another agreed, they expect us to be corporate warriors, answer e-mails at 2:00 in the morning and get by on four hours of sleep a night.” Several people at once said, “We can’t keep this up.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781118910665.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781118910665sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Overworked and Overwhelmed"></a>
         </div>The conversation I led that evening was the beginning of work and a thought process that led to my new book, 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781118910665.html"><i>Overworked and Overwhelmed: The Mindfulness Alternative</i></a>. One of the things I’ve noticed in my work as an executive coach and speaker over the past four or five years is that most of the executives, managers and professionals I work with are trying to work harder every year. The demands of a “do more with less” culture and a 24/7, smart phone enabled operating environment have left too many people teetering on the brink of a caffeine-addicted, sleep-deprived, stressed-out existence. The impact of all of that on short-term productivity and happiness and long-term health and well being is devastating. 
         <br>
         <br>Because of all they’re trying to do and pay attention to many of the leaders and professionals I work with are in a chronic state of fight or flight. Their stress hormones and blood pressure are too high and their immune and digestive systems don’t operate at healthy levels. In the short run, all of that leads to anxiety, insomnia, poor decision making, lack of focus and generally poor health. In the long run, it leads to broken relationships, premature aging and early death. 
         <br>
         <br>The point I’m trying to make in 
         <i>Overworked and Overwhelmed</i> is it doesn’t have to be that way. There are simple, relatively easy steps you can take to pull your life from the brink. That’s where the mindfulness alternative comes in. Over the past few years, mindfulness has gotten more and more attention in the mainstream media – it's even made the cover of Time magazine. The picture that a lot of people get in their minds when they hear the word mindfulness is of blissed out people sitting cross legged while they meditate and chant. That’s one way to do it, but it’s not something that most stressed out professionals are going to do. 
         <br>
         <br>What I’m presenting in my book is what I’ve learned about how the basics of mindfulness can be used and applied by just about anyone who needs to get out of chronic fight or flight. We all know what fight or flight is – it’s supposed to be the emergency response system controlled by your body’s sympathetic nervous system. It’s a big problem when the fight or flight response gets stuck in the on position and becomes chronic. That’s where another system that all of us have but few of us have heard of comes into play. It’s called your rest and digest response and is controlled by your body’s parasympathetic nervous system. You can think of it as fight or flight being the gas pedal and rest and digest as the brakes. We need to exercise both throughout the day to be healthy, happy and effective. Fortunately, there are simple, easy to do routines that we can learn from the practice of mindfulness that can help even the most overworked and overwhelmed people activate their rest and digest response. I summarize a lot of those routines in my book and offer a simple one-page framework called the Life GPS
         <sup>®</sup> that helps make it easy to follow through on the routines that help you show up at your best. 
         <br>
         <br>The Life GPS
         <sup>®</sup> asks for your answers to three questions: 
         <ul>
          <li>How am I when I’m at my best?</li> 
          <li>What are the routines – physical, mental, relational and spiritual – that will help me show up at my best?</li> 
          <li>What outcomes do I hope to see in the three big arenas of life – home, work and community – if I regularly show up at my best?</li>
         </ul> Based on my work with hundreds of leaders, I can tell you that getting clear about your Life GPS
         <sup>®</sup> and following through on it can help you step back from the brink and make a huge difference in the quality of your life and for the people you care most about. It doesn’t require perfection in either discipline or execution. It just requires the willingness to take some small initial steps and repeating them until they’ve become healthy habits. 
         <br>
         <br>It’s never too late to pull yourself back from the brink and reclaim your life. Now is a great time to get started. My goal with

         </div>We can’t separate our leadership from who we are inside. “Your well-being, success, and organization depend, first and foremost on who you are. You need to examine the internal stuff—what goes on in your mind and heart—before doing anything,” writes Bob Rosen in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781118680773.html"><i>Grounded</i></a> . 
         <br>
         <br>Faced with the speed of change today, staying aligned with who we are is very difficult making us feel stressed and defeated. We can deal with the winds of change in one of three ways: ignore the change, deal with it head on with uninformed short-term fixes, or get ahead of it. Those ignoring the situation often “adapt a rigid attitude toward personal change, avoiding introspection or soul-searching that might threaten long-held values or unexamined results.” Those who get ahead of it are not only flexible but are personally grounded. 
         <br>
         <br>Rosen says that great leaders are grounded in six areas: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Physical Health</b> / How You Live: Not just the absence of disease but the presence of health. “Strong personal health begins with body-mind awareness, which gives you the personal insights and knowledge to develop a healthy lifestyle specially tailored for you.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Emotional Health</b> / How You Feel: Having good self-awareness. “Emotionally healthy leaders have a nimbleness, evident in their reactions, thinking and behavior.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Intellectual Health</b> / How You Think: Having a good curiosity so that you can break out of your mental comfort zone. “By expanding your mental range, you can broaden your thinking, solve complex problems, and focus on what is truly important.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Social Health</b> / How You Interact: The ability to build mutually rewarding relationships while being true to yourself – transparent and connected. “Leadership follows an inside-outside progression. Social health starts with authenticity, advances to mutually rewarding relationships, and culminates in nourishing teams and communities.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Vocational Health</b> / How You Perform: Meaningful work that reflects who you are. “A company led by an ill-equipped leader soon falls behind in the race for talent and productivity. Now more than ever, people are yearning for leaders to create the conditions that enable others to excel and to reach their full potential.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Spiritual Health</b> / How You View the World: The ability to recognize a higher purpose and something more meaningful than your personal needs. It’s connecting at the macro level. “On a personal level, individuals become alienated, rootless, and self-destructive. A business devoid of spiritual health promotes elfish, parochial, and narrow financial interests above humanity and social responsibility.” 
         <br>
         <br>Rosen says that these six areas are part of a system of health and if one of these subsystems is out of line, the entire system can come undone. “Poor leadership is a failure or breakdown of the whole or of part of the system.” 
         <br>
         <br>Rosen deals with each of these areas addressing the key issues of each, identifying where you need work, and how to develop and master each of them. The process requires self-awareness, disciple and the conscious choice to take the steps to achieve desired outcomes.

         </div>Tim Irwin says “leadership failures rarely reflect a problem with the leader’s competence. Most often the fall occurs because of a breach of something inside the leader.” This is not surprising because we lead from our core. No matter how polished we become on the outside, eventually what is on the inside comes through. 
         <br>
         <br>Great leadership is not a technique. It comes from within. In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781939529046.html"><i>Impact</i></a>, Irwin says, “Truly engaging others flows from the essence of who we are—from our core. Management is positional; leadership is personal.” 
         <br>
         <br>We see this too often: “Unregulated power is one of the chief instigators of a compromised core.” Something happened along the way. Successful leadership depends on growing and protecting our core. Of course, self-awareness is key. And we must acknowledge that all is not well. “Our culture’s obsession with striving to look perfect makes us reluctant to look at our own duality—that some of our impulses are noble, while others are not so benevolent. 
         <b>It is not that we have yielded to our shadow, but we prefer to deny that we even <i>have</i> a shadow.</b>” 
         <br>
         <br>Power and our tendency to misuse it, is an area we need to be aware of. “
         <b>Self-awareness and self regulation must grow in direct proportion to the power we exert.</b>” 
         <br>
         <br>Irwin discusses identifying and dealing with arrogance, the beliefs that drive our behavior, self-deception. He also stresses the need for accountability We can’t regulate our core alone. Unfortunately, too many leaders derail themselves because they think that they are too good to be held accountable by anyone else. We need to have people around us that will speak candidly with us. 
         <b>Accountability</b> must be part of the organization’s culture. If it is not, the first place to look for a lack of accountability is at the very top. 
         <br>
         <br>Steve Reinemund, former chairman and CEO of PepsiCo told Irwin: 
         <blockquote>
          Accountability is being responsible to some other person or organization for the activities and actions we take. it is critical to an individuals performance and an organization’s integrity and credibility. 
          <br>
          <br>A good organization where high-performing people want to work is a place where people have responsibilities and accountabilities for their actions and how they perform in their jobs. High performing organizations do a great job of defining accountability and then measuring it and holding people accountable for results on a real time basis. 
          <br>
          <br>Some of the best organizations that I have seen are very clear and very specific about those accountabilities. If people join an organization and don’t recognize its culture of accountability, they join at their own peril.
         </blockquote> They stay at their own peril too. 
         <br>
         <br>Irwin’s book is a book to keep handy and to refer to throughout the seasons of your leadership. It will help you to stay on track and lead from a solid and uncompromised core.

         <h2 class="title">How to Find Leadership Blindspots</h2> 
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781118646298.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781118646298sm.jpg" width="91" height="120" border="0" alt="Blindspots"></a>
         </div>Blindspots. Those problems that are right in front of us that we fail to see. We all have them not because we can’t find them, but because we don’t look very hard. 
         <br>
         <br>In 
         <i>Leadership Blindspots</i>, author Robert Shaw make this important observation: “
         <b>Leadership strengths are often found in close proximity to blindspots.</b> An overpowering strength, in particular, usually has an associated blindspot.” 
         <br>
         <br>Shaw suggests that not all blindspots are bad. Some may actually protect a leader from doubt. For instance a certain confidence may “push him or her forward in the face of uncertainty and adversity” to “see what is possible beyond what a realistic assessment would suggest is sensible.” Yes, but…. I would talk about it differently but eventually arrive at the same place. 
         <br>
         <br>To me a blindspot is a blindspot and needs to be uncovered. Once uncovered it can be managed in some way. An uncommon confidence in your approach to uncertainty may serve you well and if recognized and understood it is no longer a blindspot but an approach to life that is managed. 
         <b>Any blindspot puts distance between you and reality.</b> A small deviation may never become an issue but large deviations will eventually trip you up. 
         <blockquote>
          An 
          <i>optimal margin of illusion</i> occurs when individuals have a small, positive distortion about themselves. This results in an advantage over those who are more realistic. A positive bias is useful because it increases an individual’s motivation to move forward in risky situations and persevere in difficult situations.
         </blockquote> “Leaders get into trouble when they don’t know what they don’t know in areas that matter.” There are degrees of blindness: 
         <br>
         <br>First is a 
         <b>complete lack of awareness</b>. Leaders are said to be blindsided by these weaknesses or threats. 
         <br>
         <br>Second is 
         <b>denial</b>. “In this case, a leader may be aware of a weakness or threat but doesn’t analyze it in sufficient depth to understand its causes and potential impact. The vulnerability is seen by the leader as ‘not being a big deal’ or ‘not my problem.’” 
         <br>
         <br>And third is the 
         <b>failure to act</b> on a known weakness or threat. “There are cases when a leader knows that trouble lies ahead but fails to take action due to a range of factors including a lack of skill. I refer to this as a type of blindness because the leader fails to fully appreciate the risk he or she is facing and the consequences of not taking action.” 
         <br>
         <br>Not all blindspots are created equal. “Leaders need to question the relative importance of a weakness or threat once they become aware of it.” 
         <br>
         <br>Not surprisingly, “the more power and status people have, the less likely they are to pay attention to those below them and the less empathic they will be.” So we just don’t bother searching for blindspots. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>Leadership Blindspots</i> has a 
         <b><i>Leadership Blindspot Survey</i></b> in the appendix of the book. It contains self-assessment questions in each of the four potential blindspot areas: self, team, company and markets.

         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780670026142.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9780670026142sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div>Failure is how we learn. The problem is, argues Megan McArdle, we’re forgetting that truth. We are becoming too risk-averse and that is bad for our children, for our personal lives, for our companies, and for our country. 
         <br>
         <br>While we tend to treat success as finite and failure as disaster, the reality is that in order to be successful, we must learn how to harness the power of failure. In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780670026142.html"><i>The Up Side Down</i></a>, McArdle explains why. 
         <br>
         <br>Unfortunately, 
         <b>teaching our kids</b> how to fail smartly is one of the most important things we (and our schools) could be doing. Instead, we protect our kids from failure. 
         <blockquote>
          Educational software can help kids master new skills by pinpointing where they’re going wrong, and letting them practice just that task over and over until they get it. And yet, we don’t seem to be carrying that lesson outside the computer lab. Perhaps this is because even as our electronics have become a better and better environment for learning from failure, our educational system has become much worse.
         </blockquote> Of course, learning from failure means asking the right questions after a failure and taking responsibility for the answers. “Learning to fail well means overcoming our natural instincts to blame someone—maybe ourselves—whenever something goes wrong.” Perhaps we deflect responsibility not just to make ourselves look better, but also to create a sense of control and structure in the world. 
         <br>
         <br>Our fear of failure also causes us to 
         <i>stay the course</i> long after we should have quit. 
         <b>The biggest key to understand</b>, says McArdle,
         <b> is that failure is not the problem</b>. It’s our refusal to recognize that we have failed. “If we assume that failure is a catastrophe, we’ll often try to delay recognizing it as long as possible. That, of course, gives your failure lots of room to turn into a disaster.” 
         <br>
         <br>In 
         <i>The Up Side of Down</i> you’ll find why making 
         <b>bankruptcy</b> easy relative to the rest of the world means not only are people willing to takes more risks, but they are feed to try again. “We built the biggest, richest country in the world” and we did it mostly because “we were willing to risk more, and forgive more easily, than most other countries. We lend more freely, and let debtors off the hook; we regulate more lightly, and rely on a hit-and-miss liability system instead. These things are often painted as weaknesses, but in fact they are great strengths. They are the sign of a country more invested in the future than the past.” 
         <br>
         <br>Sharing her own experiences among the unemployed, she explains the psychology of why some 
         <b>unemployed people</b> stay unemployed—and what can be done about it. In a chapter titled “Adopting the Way of the Shark,” she explains why you need to keep moving. She notes, “It is very difficult to communicate the progressive corrosion of long-term unemployment to someone who has not endured it.” Money is an issue, but the psychological toll is worse—withdrawing from social relationships because it is “increasingly painful to hang out with people who have jobs.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>The Up Side Down</i> is persuasive and engaging. It is a rewarding read that will have you looking at the “failures” in your life as opportunities to learn and reinvent yourself.

         <h2 class="title">The 12 Rules of Respect</h2> 
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780071816090.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9780071816090sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Respect"></a>
         </div>Paul Meshanko has highlighted the importance of demonstrating respect in all of our interactions in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780071816090.html"><i>The Respect Effect</i></a>. The desired result is that those we interact with will feel valued in some way. He offers 12 Ways of thinking and behaving around others: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>1. Be Aware of Your Nonverbal and Extra-verbal Cues.</b> 
         <br>What we say is important but how we say it can make or break the communication. “Extra-verbal cues include the speed with which we speak, our volume relative to background noise, our inflection, and our willingness to pause to make space for others to speak.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>2. Develop Curiosity About the Perspectives of Others.</b> 
         <br>“Empathy is demonstrated when it becomes evident to others around us that we are interested in what they think, why they think it, and how they feel about it. When this happens, it becomes easier to communicate respect to others, even if we disagree with them.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>3. Assume that Everyone is Smart About Something.</b> 
         <br>“Because I like to think I’m smart, it is reasonable to assume that other people like to think they are also smart. The only difference is that we are all smart through different histories and life experiences.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>4. Become a Better Listener by Shaking Your “But.”</b> The word “but” can be used in a way that hinders our ability to show respect. The word “but” negates what came before it. Replacing it with “and” and other words that validate and convey consideration, the entire tone is changed. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>5. Look for Opportunities to Connect with and Support Others.</b> 
         <br>“Even in the heat of conflict, there are ways to connect with people if we want to. When we demonstrate a willingness to move away from our immediate agenda and search for positions of agreement first, it makes working through the actual differences a bit easier.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>6. When You Disagree, Explain Why.</b> 
         <br>“It is disrespectful when we fail to share our observations and opinions in order to avoid conflict. We have an obligation to others to be truthful with our perspectives and points of view. When done with civility, tact, and room for counterarguments, sharing our perspectives leads to the best decisions and optimal results. It also prevents the accumulation of ‘baggage’ that builds up when we keep things bottled up.” And remember, it works both ways. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>7. Look for Opportunities to Grow, Stretch, and Change.</b> 
         <br>“As we develop the desire and the willingness to hold ourselves up to the proverbial ‘bright light’ for an occasional reality check, two things happen. First, we become infinitely easier to be around because we are less critical of others. Second, we grow in wisdom and perspective. That’s because we start considering that, in situations where we might initially view others critically, the problems may be ours to deal with and not theirs. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>8. Learn to Be Wrong on Occasion.</b> 
         <br>“From a neurological perspective, there is absolutely no correlation between our degree of certainty about a subject and the likelihood that we are actually correct in our beliefs. This means that our feeling of certainty about something is nothing more than a strong emotion. The stronger the emotion, the more likely we are to develop blind spots around it.” An open mind is a demonstration of respect. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>9. Never Hesitate to Say You Are Sorry.</b> 
         <br>“Unfortunately, it is often when we’re at our worst that our actions are most memorable to others. While we don’t expect everybody to be perfect, “we do expect people to make it right when their words, actions, or decisions cause damage.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>10. Intentionally Engage Others in Ways that Build Their Self-Esteem.</b> 
         <br>“Building esteem in people we work with or for requires a shift in agendas. It takes a shift in focus away from what we need to what others need.” Meshanko colleague Teresa Welborne said, “If you are in a leadership position and you are not a people person, you become a liability to your organization. And if you’re not willing to make the effort to become a people person, you should not be in a position of leadership.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>11. Be Respectful of Time When Making Comments.</b> 
         <br>“If we don’t become curious or have value for what other people have to say, it is difficult to consistently fake the behaviors that demonstrate interest.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>12. Smile!</b> 
         <br>“Sometimes the most effective strategies are also the simplest. With rare exception, when we meet people who greet us with a smile, they are sending us important information about heir intentions.” 
         <br>
         <br>Meshanko concludes with 3 key ingredients to improving your ability to demonstrate respect for others: 
         <blockquote>
          Respect is about you and me, not “them,” and our commitment to it influences everyone around us. Once we understand the value proposition respect offers, that insight can provide us with patience, courage, and creativity. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Patience</b> permits us to maintain our composure and respectful demeanor when others are not acting at their best. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Courage</b> enables us to candidly challenge disrespectful behavior and actions directed toward others. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Creativity</b> allows us to see points of connection, even in the midst of conflict. 
          <br>
          <br>When we bring these qualities online and into our work interactions, everyone benefits, including our peers, customers, vendors, and ultimately, our shareholders.

          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781118644041.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781118644041sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Youtr WHAT"></a>
         </div>Your WHAT is the “single most crucial element of your life that needs to be identified, defined, and fulfilled,” says Steve Olsher in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781118644041.html"><i>What is Your What?</i></a> Here’s why: 
         <br>
         <br>Your unfulfilled WHAT will absolutely affect you in a variety of unexpected ways. It could be the source of your high blood pressure, the reason you don’t feel “good enough,” the cause of your general sense of loathing when you wake up, or the impetus behind your efforts at self-sabotage. 
         <br>
         <br>It should be noted here that finding your 
         <i>what</i> is not a surefire way to fame and riches—or gainful employment for that matter. And while each person is unique, many others possess similar abilities and may fill a need in the marketplace better than you do. It takes work. At the same time, some people chose to work at jobs that do not fulfill or satisfy their what because it fills a purpose or a value that they consider to be greater than their own personal needs. Perhaps that is their what. That said, 
         <i>What is Your What?</i> will help you get to gain control over your life rather than letting it happen haphazardly. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>What is Your What?</i> is a self-awareness book to help you connect with who you really are. What you do from there is your choice. Olsher has developed a three-step process to help you uncover and reconnect with your natural strengths, identify the vehicle you’ll leverage to share your gifts with the world and the specific audiences who’ll benefit most from your gifts. 
         <br>
         <br>“As we endure life’s hardships, we tend to lose touch with our inner greatness. We start to make distasteful compromises, settle for less, and become people different from our deepest selves.” Becoming aware of how you were knocked down is the first step in ascending to your most natural state of being. 
         <br>
         <br>Olsher bases his program on seven principles: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>1. Recognize YaNo Moments.</b> These are those moments when you are faced with a choice. Some are big; some are small. “Any time you undertake an activity without evaluating the impact your choice will have on your life, you run the risk of compromising your state of mind. The key to regaining control of your life is to make deliberate choices with an understanding of the consequences.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>2. Reclaim the Canyon.</b> Establish space between life as it happens and your reaction to those events. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>3. The Sufficiency Theory.</b> Attain satisfaction, peace, and contentment by minimizing material desires and the effect of outside influences. Olsher suggests that we stop drawing lines in the sand. “Happiness is not a destination that can be reached by attaining select milestones. Shift your approach from waiting for certain things to happen in order to feel a certain way to feeling and acting that way now. Surprisingly often, this will spur the results you desire to happen.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>4. Retrain Your Brain.</b> “Anything from your past that you choose to relive becomes a part of your identity. Be careful about which memories you commit to.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>5. Incorporate Jack Welch’s successful business practices into your behavior.</b> Specifically, become highly focused on who you are, what you stand for, and what your purpose is; identify the Top 20 Percent, Vital 70 Percent, and Bottom 10 Percent for each area of your life; achieve Six Sigma in all key aspects of your life and strive to accept nothing less than your best. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>6. The Not-So-Golden Rule.</b> Eliminate fear or expectation as a motive for your actions. Your motive does matter. Act out of love, without the expectation of anything in return. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>7. The Slow Death of Not Being the Star.</b> Shift your focus away from time-consuming distractions and toward the pursuit of your personal goals. Keep track of your activities for a week. “Chances are you’ll find that what you’ve been thinking of as relaxing ‘downtime’ is actually the dominant force in your life, devouring months and years you can never get back.”

         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780316204361.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9780316204361sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div>Malcom Gladwell wants us to rethink how we think about the giants in our lives whether they be outsized opponents, disabilities, misfortunes, or oppression. We all face or have faced odds that seemed to be stacked against us. Odds that we are forced to deal with. 
         <br>
         <br>In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780316204361.html"><i>David and Goliath</i></a>, Gladwell shares two ideas. First, “much of what we consider valuable in our world arises out of these kinds of lopsided conflicts, because the act of facing overwhelming odds produces greatness and beauty.” The battle makes us better. It develops us and reveals strengths that we didn’t know we had. 
         <br>
         <br>Second, giants are not always what we think they are. The powerful and strong are not always what they seem. Often their strength can expose their greatest vulnerability. Their size can be their undoing. What we see as their overwhelming advantages can also be the thing that limits their options. 
         <br>
         <br>We know but easily forget, that there is a point where more doesn’t make a difference and more still becomes a disadvantage. “We all assume,” writes Gladwell, “that being bigger and stronger and richer is always in our best interest.” A wealthy man told Gladwell about the relationship between wealth and parenting: 
         <blockquote>
          My own instinct is that it’s much harder than anybody believes to bring kinds up in a wealthy environment. People are ruined by challenged economic lives. But they’re ruined by wealth as well because they lose their ambition and they lose their pride and they lose their sense of self-worth. It’s difficult at both ends of the spectrum. There’s some place in the middle which probably works best of all.
         </blockquote> Gladwell is a master storyteller. The stories are compelling and at times provocative. But they all make you think. 
         <br>
         <br>Gladwell makes the point that certainly some people triumph over their disabilities in spite of them. They simply won’t let them stand in their way. But there are those that succeed 
         <i>because</i> of their disability. “They learned something in their struggle that proved to be of enormous advantage.” Challenges can cause us to develop skills we might not otherwise have developed if we choose to respond that way. 
         <br>
         <br>Although Gladwell makes the point that there are “desirable disadvantages,” in that it is the difficulty that eventually led to a person’s success and made them a better person, it is not to suggest that we should wish for more disadvantages or wish them on other people. We all have disadvantages, some are huge and some are not, but the lesson is in how we see them. How we react. 
         <br>
         <br>Some of what we perceive as advantages—opportunities or resources that we wish we had—have actually ruined people or diminished their full potential in some way. 
         <br>
         <br>The thread that runs through all of Gladwell’s examples is how individuals or organizations turned their disadvantages to their advantage—how they defeated giants by reframing their perceived advantage. There is no formula here as to what will work and what won’t. The question is as it has always been, how will you respond to what you have been given? 
         <br>
         <br>The key lesson is that for the most part, difficulties are what you make of them.

         </div>Gaps in what we know can trouble us for a time, but gaps in what we know about ourselves and others can truly keep us up at night. We are unpredictable, messy, complicated, illogical, and fallible. That will never change, “but through a commitment to self-awareness we can all become more highly attuned to the subtle and not-so-subtle red flags that sometimes pull us off course.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780814432112.html"><i>What Keeps Leaders Up at Night?</i></a> by Nicole Lipkin is a treatise on self-awareness and personal responsibility and the damaging effects a lack of those qualities has in our lives. 
         <br>
         <br>“You can’t change what’s already happened, but you can change what you do next.…I’ve learned that the solutions always begin with raising my self-awareness and helping others raise theirs.” 
         <br>
         <br>Using research personal examples, Lipkin tackles a number of issues: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>I’m a Good Boss. So Why Do I Sometimes Act Like a Bad One?</b> (You usually find three overarching reasons: too busy to win, too proud to see, and too afraid to lose. “Although most of us don’t like to admit it, we often get all wrapped up in our own ideas, not because we are idiots but because we are human. It’s natural to think our ideas best, especially when we’re the boss.”) 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Why Don’t People Heed My Sage Advice?</b> (If you focus on treating your people with kindness and respect, your influence will grow.) 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Why Do I Lose My Cool in Hot Situations?</b> (“Leaders who want to solve the problems that keep them up at night would be wise to begin with a through inventory of their stress personality.” Learn “how to negotiate your own reactions to the stress that inevitably occurs every day.”) 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Why Does a Good Fight Sometimes Turn Bad?</b> (The emotions underlying a good fight gone bad in the workplace often occur as a result of a dense of injustice, contention for resources or standing, or [I suspect most likely] feelings of inferiority.”) 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Why Can Ambition Sabotage Success?</b> (“The Julius Caesars of the world often end up failing because they pursue myopic success, a ‘nearsighted’ view that defines success in terms of self-interest. The Caesar Augustuses, on the other hand, pursue panoramic success, defining success in terms of the ‘big picture’ best interests of all.”) 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Why Do People Resist Change?</b> (“We find it amazingly easy to turn our backs on compelling reasons to change…Beginning in childhood, we tend to shed habits that don’t serve us well but hang on tightly to those habits that provide us comfort or safety. These persistent habits are able to endure even the most vicious assaults long past their expiration date.”) 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Why Do Good Teams Go Bad?</b> (“Few other aspects of organizational life pose greater challenges to a leader than the behavior of people in groups.” Groups are inevitable, and once we do join a group, some truly fascinating dynamics kick in as Lipkin explains.) 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>What Causes a Star to Fade?</b> (The failure to engage people. “Engagement depends more than anything else on the sort of panoramic leadership Augustus practices throughout his tenure as Rome’s leader.”) 
         <br>
         <br>If things do start to go south, here are 
         <b>Three Simple Rules</b> for getting back on track: 
         <br>
         <br>1. Seek Self-Awareness 
         <br>2. Help Other Gain Self-Awareness 
         <br>3. Remember we’re Only Human After All.

         <br>
         <br>Too often work seems harder than it should be. We can feel helpless in dealing with the realities of "today's" workplace. That said, every time period seems unparalleled in all of history to those going through it. However, people have always struggled with these issues: doing more with less; reduced hours, benefits, or pay; increased work hours; underappreciated. The problem is, as Wakeman puts it, "no one is born accountable self-reliant, self-mastered, and resilient, yet these are the qualities that count, the ones that will fill you with confidence and afford you the chance to chose your destiny, no matter what your field of endeavor." The trick is learning to see your circumstances differently. 
         <br>
         <br>Wakeman has put this book together to help you do just that. If you have been playing the victim for a substantial period of time, her ideas will seem impossible, but they are the only thing that will work. 
         <blockquote>
          I am here to tell you: You are not a cog in a machine — far from it. You have more control than you think. That’s the good news. The bad news is, you and you alone are causing your own suffering. What most of you have lost touch with is that it isn’t your reality that is causing your pain and frustration. It’s the worn-out methods, techniques, and mind-sets with which you are approaching your reality. I’m here to tell you that your suffering is optional. I can help you get back on track so you can find bliss in your work again, while becoming more valuable to your organization than ever before.
         </blockquote> She has created some pretty straightforward, brief assessments to determine your current performance and your future potential. Your value, plain and simple is based on "the value you bring to your organization, the market value of your work, and the return on investment that you deliver, both economically and emotionally, now and into the future." You must be clear about the value you bring to your organization. The three factors that make up your value: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>YOUR VALUE = Current Performance + Future Potential - (3 x Emotional Expensiveness)</b> 
         <br>
         <br>The chapter on 
         <i>Your Emotional Expensiveness</i> is worth reading twice. It's your drama factor. "It is the single most important factor in the New Value Equation, the one that determines whether our Performance and Potential and anything meaningful to the bottom line, and whether others feel that working with us is worth the effort." Wakeman lists 15 clues to your emotional expensiveness factor. Among them are: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>You may be Emotionally Expensive if …</b> 
         <ul>
          <li>You come to work in a bad mood. Ever.</li> 
          <li>You share a lot of personal information with coworkers, and the boundary between your public life and private life is very permeable.</li> 
          <li>You complain a lot or judge others.</li> 
          <li>You tend to focus in what you need rather than what you have.</li> 
          <li>You assume the worst of others' motivations.</li> 
          <li>When you perform well, you want a medal for it.</li>
         </ul> Wakeman presents the 
         <b>Five Reality-Based Rules of the Workplace</b>: 
         <br>
         <br>1. 
         <b>Your level of accountability determines your level of happiness.</b> Personally accountable people bring their own motivation and engagement to everything they do. Be one of those people, and you will ensure your job security—or that your résumé goes to the top of the stack. 
         <br>
         <br>2. 
         <b>Suffering is optional … so ditch the drama.</b> (Wakeman estimates that the average person spends two hours each day in drama—complaining, creating stories, and arguing with reality.) Your circumstances are what they are, but your reaction to them is up to you. 
         <blockquote>
          Even if you don't share your drama with others, there is no such thing as a throwaway thought. Most thoughts lead in some way to an action—or lack of action….Your thinking manifests itself in a way that affects everyone around you and the way they see you. 
          <br>
          <br>If you remain in your lane, tending to your own responsibilities in the present, you will seldom be stressed. You'll be clear, capable, and effective. Stress enters the picture when you leave your lane to meddle in other people's business, judging or trying to control them. 
          <br>
          <br>Learn to see stress as a sign—not that the world is going to hell in a handbasket, but that you are not currently living in reality and need to inquire on your thinking.
         </blockquote> 
         <b>3. Buy-in is not optional.</b> To succeed, your buy-in is not optional, and action, not opinion, adds value. The most valuable people say "yes" the most often. If a decision has been made, opinions are no longer welcome. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>4. Say “yes” to what’s next.</b> Your success will not be dependent on everything staying the same, but on your readiness for what's next. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>5. You will always have extenuating circumstances.</b> Succeed anyway. That which is missing from this situation is something I am not giving. When you find something missing (especially—but not limited to—intangibles, like honesty, generosity, humor, sensitivity, or gratitude) don't dwell on what other people "should" be doing or giving.

         </div> In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781590799604.html"><i>Balance</i></a>, James A. Cusumano reflects on his five careers as the lead singer of a rock band, an Exxon research scientist and executive, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, a filmmaker and a luxury hotel owner. Through it all he points to people who helped him along the way and pointed him in the right direction. Their perspective helped keep his life in balance. 
         <br>
         <br>We can all make a unique contribution with the specific set of skills we came into this world with says Cusumano and "there is no greater personal satisfaction on this planet than being in the thick of doing so." 
         <br>
         <br>To find your passion and purpose, you have to answer four questions: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>1.</b> What do I love to do so much so that time passes incredibly quickly? 
         <br>
         <b>2.</b> What work do I do or have done in the past that I do not consider work? 
         <br>
         <b>3.</b> What could I do that would create the greatest value for the world around me, as well as the greatest personal satisfaction for the amount of time spent? 
         <br>
         <b>4.</b> What is my unique ability, the skill or skills which, if truly actualized, could provide significant benefits to the organization for which I work and to me? 
         <br>
         <br>He believes that 80 percent of his success was based on his early discovery of his fundamental essence—his life purpose—that was fueled by the energy of passion and guided by the "giants" in his life. 
         <br>
         <br>Passion fuels your creativity and the process provides a deep sense of gratitude and "
         <b>gratitude always leads to long-term fulfillment and happiness</b>. The greater your sense of gratitude, the greater your level of happiness." 
         <br>
         <br>Cusumano provides 
         <b>eight principles for building a successful business</b>: 
         <ol>
          <li>Have a skilled CEO who embraces and is committed to <b><i>Inspired Leadership*</i></b>, and has a deep sense of how to create a challenging, far-reaching, yet realistic company vision and mission. The CEO creates the dream; committed employees embrace and embellish it.</li> 
          <li>Achieve passionate buy-in of this vision and mission from all key stakeholders—customers, employees, investors, suppliers, and the community.</li> 
          <li>Coach employees on developing corporate values to which they are firmly committed.</li> 
          <li>Hire the right people for the right positions at the right time—and compassionately and quickly ask those to leave who do not work out. </li> 
          <li>Address a growing market, better yet, create one. Don't waste your time on dying markets.</li> 
          <li>Focus strictly and passionately on the best opportunities. You can't do everything.</li> 
          <li>Plan for an early commercial success—even a modest one. Hit a few singles instead of trying for all home runs.</li> 
          <li>Have a strategic plan but stay flexible. For maximum effectiveness, the plan should be understood and embraced by all employees.</li>
         </ol> 
         <b><i>*Inspired Leadership</i></b> is based on the 
         <i>CASTLE Principles</i>, an acronym for Courage, Authenticity, Service, Truthfulness, Love, and Effectiveness developed by Lance Secretan. 
         <i>Inspired Leadership</i> is a serving relationship with others that inspires them to grow and reach their innate human potential and in doing so they not only exhibit outstanding performance and thereby contribute much more to their company, but they also make the world a better place. Inspired Leadership is not a model, or a formula, or a system, or a process. Instead of 
         <i>doing</i> something to someone, Inspired Leadership is a way of 
         <i>being</i> and it comes from within.

         <h2 class="title">The First Step in Self-Awareness Isn’t You - Redux</h2> Human beings—and that includes most leaders—are relational. 
         <br>
         <br>Self-leadership is fundamental to good leadership, but it is not the end-game. 
         <br>
         <br>Self-awareness for self-awareness sake has a limited value. 
         <br>
         <br>Through introspection and reflection we can get to know a great deal about ourselves—as far as we know. The problem is that we don't know what we don't know. Only when we are able to test our assumptions about ourselves, can we know if we are getting it right. It is when we see ourselves in relation to others and in relation to a higher purpose that we really begin to clarify (and many times even identify) our core values, beliefs and intentions. We can all know who we think we are, but it isn't until we get out and interact with others that we can begin to see where we are right and where we have been fooling ourselves. 
         <br>
         <br>Who we are takes on meaning when it is in the context of our relationship with others. Superman's stance on "truth, justice and the American Way" is pointless if he remains isolated in his Fortress of Solitude. His values only have meaning in relationship to other people. All the self-knowledge in the world counts for very little if it is not put to work in the service of others. 
         <br>
         <br>Self-awareness that points to your unique contribution in the world is leadership. Who you are is leveraged when it is placed in the service of other people. Surely we must lead with integrity—in a manner consistent with who we are. However, the only way to know if we are really doing that is by looking at how we impact the lives of others—how our leadership is experienced by others. 
         <br>
         <br>Self-awareness provides the opportunity for us to close the gap between who we think we are or want to be and who we actually are at a particular point in time. But that can only be achieved with feedback of some kind. I want to share a lengthy story provided by Scott Weiss in his great book 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781608324224.html" title="Dare"><i>DARE</i></a>, to illustrate this point. It's a book about trust in leadership and the trust that is generated by knowing who you are and leading as that person. 
         <blockquote>
          At thirty-five, I was already an executive vice president with Turner Broadcasting, overseeing two divisions and reporting directly to the second most senior executive who soon would be named the company's CEO. I believed that I was very much at the top of my game, already delivering a lot of high-level presentations, and getting consistent positive feedback. I was more than a little offended by the suggestion that I needed any help at all with my communication skills. But I went. 
          <br>
          <br>In Atlanta, I participated in Speakeasy's exclusive, invitation-only workshop for C-suite executives. Called "The Leader's Edge," this intense three-day workshop focused on communication style and delivery with respect to leadership. In spite of my initial resistance, I did my best to participate without revealing my conviction that I felt superior to this target audience that needed help with communication and presentation skills. I wasn't the least bit nervous when it came time to watch the video recordings of our individual presentations. I was sure I'd done just fine. 
          <br>
          <br>With the others in our group, I watched as the executive persona of Scott Weiss delivered his speech from the screen. The guy up there looked pretty good. Very sure of himself. Very corporate. Very buttoned up. I expected to be told, as I always had been before, that I was a very effective presenter. But after a moment, Sandy Linver, the faculty leader who had directed our session turned to ask me a question. 
          <br>
          <br>"So," she said, "as you look at yourself, objectively, how do you perceive this person?" 
          <br>
          <br>"Fine," I said. "He seems knowledgeable. Experienced. Very confident." 
          <br>
          <br>"Hmm," she said. "That's interesting. If you could separate yourself from this person and experience him objectively, would you want to hang out with a person like that on the weekend?" 
          <br>
          <br>It was a strange question. But I looked at that person frozen on the TV monitor and thought about it. Reluctantly, I had to tell the truth. 
          <br>
          <br>"No," I said. "Probably not." 
          <br>
          <br>"Really?" she asked. "And why not?" 
          <br>
          <br>"Well," I said, "because I don't hang out with people like that." 
          <br>
          <br>I'm not sure whether there was a collective gasp from the audience or just a stunned silence, but what she said next definitely stunned me. 
          <br>
          <br>"You know, don't you, that you're talking about 
          <i>yourself</i>?" 
          <br>
          <br>Yes. I was. I had just admitted that the person I was projecting was not someone to whom I could relate. He wasn't even someone I really liked! 
          <br>
          <br>And apparently, I wasn't the only one to be put off by Scott Weiss's executive persona. In our remaining time together, other members of the audience began to offer more specific impressions of how they had experienced me as a communicator, and as a person. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>Arrogant. <br>Cocky. <br>Superior. <br>Disconnected. <br>Not real.</i> 
          <br>
          <br>Those were just some of the terms they used. I had never heard myself described this way before. I felt like the emperor with no clothes. 
          <br>
          <br>I had not gone to Speakeasy for a consciousness-raising experience. But I sure had one. In the weeks following that close and uncomfortable encounter with my own executive persona, I did a lot of thinking. I examined what I had learned about how others actually 
          <i>did</i> experience me, and thought about how I 
          <i>wanted</i> people to experience me. There was a gaping abyss between those two extremes, and I realized that I had a lot of work to do to bring them closer together—to become more congruent as an individual and as a leader. I needed to find my authentic self and learn how to bring more of my real personality to my vocation.
         </blockquote> I appreciate Scott Weiss sharing this story, for it's not just a process all growth oriented leaders must go through, but a process we must 
         <b><i>seek</i></b> out continuously. 
         <br>
         <br>Feedback is a process that, if we allow it, will keep us honest with ourselves. We see things as we are; and we see ourselves through our intentions. Feedback gives us a reality check that we are free to accept or reject, but without it we have no way to combat our own self-deception. 
         <br>
         <br>We must be able to experience ourselves in relation to other people if we are to have a genuine understanding of who we are and why we do what we do. 
         <br>
         <br>So the place to begin if we truly want to know ourselves is to reflect on the impact that we have on others. Only then can we lead authentically knowing that our inner being is congruent with our outer behavior.

         <h2 class="title">The First Step in Self-Awareness Isn’t You</h2> Ironically, the more self absorbed we are, the less self-aware we are. 
         <br>
         <br>Self-awareness is vital to the development of a leader. But it's not navel-gazing. It is not an inward focus. It is an outward focus. Its ultimate goal is to improve our connection and effectiveness with others. 
         <br>
         <br>The self absorbed leader struggles with self-awareness and emotional intelligence because self-awareness is about how we are perceived by others. It's about understanding how our behaviors are affecting other people. And we just can't do that by focusing on ourselves. 
         <br>
         <br>It is easy for us to focus on ourselves—to think people just don't understand us. And when we do, we tend to rationalize rather than grow. Explain rather than listen. Disconnect rather than lead. 
         <br>
         <br>Self important leaders can't see how they are sabotaging themselves because they focus on their needs and feelings and not those of their followers. Consequently, they don't encourage feedback because it never seems relevant to them. An inward focus dooms us to operate from a place of weakness—never able to see what is holding us back. 
         <br>
         <br>It is in the character of great leaders to have a great appetite for feedback. It's a gift and still the best way to gain an awareness of ourselves. You might think of it as a personal scorecard. 
         <br>
         <br>To see where we need to grow, we need to see how we affect other people. Only then can we begin the introspection that will lead us to a deeper understanding of ourselves and learn to move past unproductive thinking and develop new behaviors.

         <br>
         <br>"A remarkable aspect of your mental life," says Daniel Kahneman, "is that you are rarely stumped." We have opinions about nearly everything and are quick to jump to conclusions based only on the information that is right in front of us. We often just go with our gut. And that hasn't always served us well. 
         <br>

         </div>• An estimated 61,535 tattoos were reversed in the United States in 2009. 
         <br>
         <br>• Forty-one percent of first marriages end in divorce. 
         <br>
         <br>• Forty-four percent of lawyers would not recommend a career in law to young people. 
         <br>
         <br>• Eighty-three percent of corporate mergers and acquisitions fail to create any value for shareholders. 
         <br>
         <br>The Heath brothers have identified 
         <b>“four villains</b>” when it comes to making decisions: 
         <ol>
          <li><b>Narrow Framing.</b> We tend to define our choices too narrowly and see them in binary terms. We miss other options.<br><br></li> 
          <li><b>Confirmation Bias.</b> We develop a quick belief about a situation and then seek out information that confirms our belief. When we want something to be true, we look for reasons to justify it.<br><br></li> 
          <li><b>Short-Term Emotion.</b> Our emotions paralyze our decisions. We think we're working it out, when all we have really done is kick up "so much dust that we can't see the way forward."<br><br></li> 
          <li><b>Overconfidence.</b> We think we know more than we actually do. The problem is that we don't know what we don't know. "The future has an uncanny ability to surprise. We can't shine a spotlight on areas when we don't know they exist."<br><br></li>
         </ol> 
         <b>What can we do?</b> We can counteract our tendencies with these four strategies the authors call the 
         <b>WRAP Process</b> from the first letter of each step: 
         <ol>
          <li><b>Widen Our Options.</b> As it turns out, most of the "decisions" we make do not involve any real choice. They are whether-or-not, yes-no decisions. We do not even consider other choices. Like a teenager, we "get stuck thinking about questions like 'Should I go to the party or not?' The party is in their mental spotlight, assessed in isolation, while the other options go unexplored. A more enlightened teen might let the spotlight roam: 'Should I go to the party all night, or go to the movies with a few friends, or attend the basketball game and then drop by the party for a few minutes?'" <br><br>We would benefit by even adding one more option to our "decision." Consider opportunity costs. ("If I do this, then I can't do that?") Or the <i>Vanishing Options Test</i>: If you cannot choose any of the current options you're considering, what else could you do? And consider asking others who have "been there done that."<br><br></li> 
          <li><b>Reality-Test Our Assumptions.</b> Encourage constructive disagreement. Consider the opposite. Consider the "outside view"—the averages. If possible, run small experiments to test our theories.<br><br></li> 
          <li><b>Attain Distance Before Deciding.</b> Try the <i>10/10/10 analysis</i>: How will you feel about your decision 10 minutes from now? How about 10 months? How about 10 years? Also, identify and stick to your core priorities. Perhaps the most powerful question for resolving a personal decisions is, "What would I tell my best friend to do in this situation?"<br><br></li> 
          <li><b>Prepare to Be Wrong.</b> We have to stretch our sense of what the future will bring—both good and bad. Think about the extremes. The future is not a "point"—a single scenario that we must predict. It's a range. Set a tripwire: "We will act when…" a predetermined set point occurs.</li>
         </ol> Making better decisions is a choice. This process will help us to make better choices.

         </div>Research shows that 
         <b>givers sink to the bottom of the success ladder</b>. Givers may make others better off, but they do so at their own expense. 
         <br>
         <br>But here's the thing, givers also land at the 
         <b><i>top</i></b> of the ladder with 
         <b>takers</b> and 
         <b>matchers</b> in the middle. Adam Grant explores in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780670026555.html"><i>Give and Take</i></a>, what separates givers at the bottom and top. And the difference is not competence, but the kinds of strategies givers use and the choices they make. 
         <br>
         <br>Grant notes that in "purely zero-sum situations and win-lose interactions, giving rarely pays off…. But most of life isn't zero-sum." 
         <br>
         <br>The giver advantage is often hard to see in the short term because the "giver advantage grows over time." Chip Conley, founder of Joie de Vivre Hotels, explains, "Being a giver is not good for a 100-yard dash, but it's valuable in a marathon." 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Strength of Weak Ties</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Givers connect with the people they know casually--their acquaintances. Although it is harder to ask them for help, they are the faster route to new leads and ideas. "The dormant ties provided more novel information than the current contacts. Over the past few years, while they were out of touch, they had been exposed to new ideas and perspectives." 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b><i>The Five-Minute Favor</i></b>: "You should be willing to do something that will take you five minutes or less 
         <i>for anybody</i>." 
         <br>
         <br>Givers create a ripple effect around themselves. "Giving, especially when it's distinctive and consistent, establishes a pattern that shifts other people's reciprocity styles within a group." Givers take on the tasks that are in the best interests of the group. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Developing Others</b> 
         <br>
         <br>As leaders, givers don't look for talent first, they focus on motivation. "Because they tend to be trusting and optimistic about other people's intentions, in their roles as leaders, managers, and mentors, givers are inclined to see the potential in everyone." 
         <br>
         <br>Takers have a general distrust of others. "Even when takers are impressed by another person's capabilities or motivation, they're more likely to see this person as a threat, which means they're less willing to support and develop him or her." Takers desire to be the smartest person in the room. 
         <br>
         <br>"The matcher's mistake lies in waiting for signs of high potential. Since matchers tend to play it safe, they often wait to offer support until they've seen evidence of promise." 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Otherish Givers</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Givers that end up on top are 
         <i>otherish</i>. "Being otherish means being willing to give more than you receive, but still keeping your own interests in sight, using them as a guide for choosing when, where, how, and to whom you give." Giving energizes and is meaningful when it is done out of choice rather than duty or obligation—and otherish givers give more than totally selfless givers. 
         <br>
         <br>To avoid being taken, it is important to distinguish between givers and takers and those that pretend to be givers. Givers become matchers when they are dealing with takers. 
         <br>
         <br>Grant provides a lot of fresh examples—people from all walks of life. What he finds most magnetic about successful givers: "they get to the top without cutting others down, finding ways of expanding the pie that benefits themselves and the people around them. Whereas success is zero-sum in a group of takers, in groups of givers, it may be true that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts."

         <br>
         <br>Bad things happen to good people. 
         <br>
         <br>And when they do, we need to be sure we are taking away the right lesson. When something bad happens we naturally prefer to process the injustice in a way that makes us coming out as the victim; we are right, they are wrong. Sympathy is in our corner. 
         <br>
         <br>But, if we are honest with ourselves, rarely do we find ourselves in a situation where we played no part. And if we have the courage to step back, we can see where we contributed to the perceived injustice. 
         <br>
         <br>In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781422189900.html"><i>What You're Really Meant to Do</i></a>, Robert Kaplan tells the story of a television producer that got passed over for a promotion. Initially, he took the easy way out. He chose to frame it as a "political" issue. "The people who get the jobs are the ones with the connections. All this talk about being a team player and helping others sounds nice, but it's not how people get ahead." This is the wrong lesson. Worse still is the fact that this thinking taints all of your thinking and behavior from this point forward and contributes to further "injustices" down the road. You undermine your "ability to exhibit character and leadership traits" that could help your career, says Kaplan. With this narrative in your head, you fail to do the things you should and when things don't go well for you, you create a self-fulfilling prophecy that further degrades your attitude and performance. At that point, everything you do is operating from a place of weakness and not your strengths. 
         <br>
         <br>He adds, the producer "found it easier to stew about the unfairness of it rather than take the more uncomfortable path of figuring out how he needed to improve." We all typically do this but we can't leave it there. Kaplan wisely counsels: 
         <blockquote>
          I urge people who have suffered a trauma that they experience as an injustice to take time out to process it. You need to reflect on what just happened, seek advice from others who witnessed it, and figure out whether you played a role in what happened…. Learning the wrong lesson, or failing to learn at all, may doom you to repeat some version of the same experience.
         </blockquote> When you have been wronged, slow down long enough to learn the right lesson.

         </div>It’s not uncommon to think of personal reinvention as being somewhat contrived or manipulative. But 
         <i>reinventing you</i> isn’t about becoming what you are not, but more of who you are. In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781422144138.html"><i>Reinventing You</i></a>, Dorie Clark says “it’s about taking control of your life and living strategically. Who do you want to be? And what do you need to get there?” It’s about making sure that our personal brands reflect the reality of our lives (Facebook notwithstanding). 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>KNOW YOURSELF</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Clark takes you through the whole process, beginning with, of course, starting where you are. This is a vital step and not to be glossed over because many of us don’t know where we are starting. We need you understand our reputation and why it is what it is. She offers ways to do this, questions to ask and how to conduct your own 360 interview—determining what those around you think about you. Very valuable material. 
         <br>
         <br>Next you need to research your next move or future destination and test drive it. (Did you know that there is a company that allows you to test-drive over 125 new careers to see if they are a fit?) 
         <br>
         <br>Once you have determined where you need to be, it is important to develop the skills you need. Clark explains how to do this and when to go back to school and when not to, and finding a mentor (someone who embodies what you’d like to develop and the person you’d like to become). 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>LEVERAGE YOUR POINTS OF DIFFERENCE</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Rebranding yourself publicly means understanding first, what is unique about you. It may not be what you think. Often it's the mindsets and thinking that proved valuable in your current situation may differentiate you in a completely unrelated field. The examples of people that Clark provides, who have done just that, are very helpful in getting you to see your unique contribution. 
         <br>
         <br>From that you can build your narrative that pulls together the underlying themes that connect your professional experiences in a way that is obvious to others. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>THE GAP</b> 
         <br>
         <br>There is a time lag–a gap–between fully inhabiting the “old you” and the “new you.” Clark writes that the “hardest part of making a transition can be bridging the gap between how others used to perceive you (and how you perceive yourself) and how you’d like to be seen moving forward.” She say the only solution is to fake it till you make it. 
         <br>
         <br>I’m sure that we have all experienced this dynamic when making any personal change. When no one readily accepts the nice person you have finally become, it’s easy to give it up and resort to the old habits of behavior. The answer is to keep projecting the new behavior until you’re comfortable with it and others begin to accept it as the new “normal.” Your commitment to the new you will eventually win people over. 
         <br>
         <br>Clark adds, “You need to be hyperaware of what you’re doing and make sure you’re signaling explicitly to the outside world what you’re trying to build.” This is where doing the homework in step one—know yourself—will help you to have the fortitude to press on. 
         <br>
         <br>Clark explains how to get the word out and how to prove your worth. She reminds us that rebranding is a process and not a one-time activity. It is important to “keep monitoring your reputation to ensure you’re being perceived by others the way you’d like.” This is a well done and thoughtful book that is valuable not just for rebranding yourself but also for managing your reputation in general.

         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781118345917.html" title="Tipping Sacred Cows" target="_blank"><i>Tipping Sacred Cows</i></a> by Jake Breeden is one of those 
         <i>bring-you-back-to-reality</i> must-read books. It is about how we undermine ourselves and our organizations and get ourselves into comfortable ruts, by blindly following seemingly virtuous traits. It’s often about taking our strengths too far or misapplying them. 
         <br>
         <br>Our values give us life and direction on one hand, “and on the other hand can steal our energy, effectiveness, and success. Like rocks in a river channel, these unexamined values can get in our way, impede our efforts, and even capsize us,” writes Breeden. 
         <br>
         <br>Julian was given the reins of a company and immediately set about cutting waste and inefficiency—his core value. Profits temporarily rose but growth eventually stalled. He took the firm “from growing inefficiently to shrinking efficiently.” In an effort to be efficient, he ripped the heart out of the organizational culture. Breeden advises: 
         <blockquote>
          Julian Fletcher shouldn’t stop being efficient—he needs to start being more sophisticated. He needs to raise his game so he understands how efficiency can harmonize with other complementary leadership traits he needs to nourish. 
          <br>
          <br>When leaders embrace beliefs without understanding and managing the potential side effects, the beliefs become sacred cows and get in the way. When leaders shut off their brains and blindly follow the bromides of conventional wisdom they set off a string of unintended consequences.
         </blockquote> Breeden tackles 
         <b>seven sacred cows</b>: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Balance:</b> “Balance operates through a constant stream of choices.” Balance is often thought to mean finding the middle ground. That’s not balance, that’s compromise. In order to find the middle ground, our choices “can too easily drift toward the middle in a cowardly compromise of nothingness. Balance backfires when it moves from being about bold, sometimes tough, choices to being about bland compromises.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Collaboration:</b> Collaboration should be accountable not automatic. “The default state of working should be alone; leaders should collaborate only when they must. Depending on your role, that may mean a significant part of your job requires collaboration. But ask yourself the question: does this work really need more than me? 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Creativity:</b> We all like creativity. It’s fun and exciting. But creativity needs to be useful and meet a real need or it’s just narcissistic creativity—creativity to serve our legacy. “Creativity should be pragmatic, not prideful.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Excellence:</b> Our pursuit of excellence “backfires when our high standards choke progress.” Forcing excellence on the process rather than the outcome. 
         <br>
         <br>One point I would add to Breeden’s section on excellence: 
         <b>excellence isn’t about doing everything perfectly. That’s perfectionism.</b> We need to be careful not to confuse the two. Excellence is a way of thinking and includes making excellent mistakes, learning an excellent lesson and perhaps even going on to make a new and different mistake. If excellence is used as an excuse for indecision, avoiding all risk or unreasonable and immovable standards, it’s counterproductive. Excellence is a term that we sometimes throw around too loosely. It’s an excuse to cover perfectionism and/or controlling and self-centered behavior—my way or the highway. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Fairness:</b> “Fairness backfires when some of our noblest instincts force us to ensure equitable outcomes rather than equitable processes.” Keeping score and evening the score to make sure no one gets more than their "fair share" often leads to regrets. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Passion:</b> Bad passion crowds out everything else causing you to ruminate on one thing at the expense of others. Healthy passion is part of a diverse set of traits. Passion backfires when it becomes obsessive. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Preparation:</b> The problem here is with too much backstage preparation. Preparation is critical but sometimes the best work is done in real-time—onstage preparation—learning while you are doing. 
         <br>
         <br>To make all of this very practical, Breeden provides in each chapter 
         <b>seven steps to:</b> Make Your Balance Bold, Make Your Collaboration Accountable, Make Your Creativity Useful, Make Your Excellence Meaningful, Train Your Brain to Focus on Process Fairness, Make Your Passion More Harmonious, and seven ideas to Take Your Preparation to Center Stage. Very helpful material. 
         <br>
         <br>“Sometimes, without realizing it, we use our most reassured values as an excuse to avoid the discomfort of actually leading.” Organizational cultures and personal assumptions promote certain values. If these values are not examined from time to time in light of the overall purpose, then they can cause derailment or stagnation. 
         <br>
         <br>We can train ourselves “to avoid the waste that comes from the unintended consequences of unexamined conventional wisdom.” We can learn to lead with wisdom.

         </div>Now 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781414362205.html"><i>Fred 2.0</i></a> brings us fresh insights, deeper understanding and wider application of the Fred Principles—and an update on the life of the real Fred Shea. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>Fred 2.0</i> is about a specific way of approaching life and business. It’s an attitude that extends far beyond customer service. It comes from within and says I will do extraordinary things because that’s who I am. It’s not a feeling—it’s who you are. It is not dependent on the performance of anyone else. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Why Would You Live this Way?</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Sanborn says it’s because being a Fred enriches others, expands you, puts more life into your living, breaks the bonds of self-absorption, makes you more employable, offers you a better way to live, creates a positive influence, and is more fun. 
         <br>
         <br>“Creativity is an essential ingredient in delivering extraordinary results,” writes Sanborn. Being creative is doing something different that adds value. More often than not, it’s the little things we notice that can be done better. This applies not only to the “things” we do, but also to our relationships; how we respond and interact to those around us. 
         <br>
         <br>Sanborn shows very specifically how to build better relationships, elevate the experience for those we come into contact with, how to build a team of Freds and how to instill the Fred approach in your kids philosophy of life. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Fred Philosophy is Good Leadership</b> 
         <br>
         <br>The Fred philosophy is ultimately what good leadership is all about. It’s a battle against mediocrity says Sanborn. 
         <blockquote>
          The first job of leadership is to help people see their significance. Leaders recognize that those who feel insignificant rarely make significant contributions. An effective leader is able to show people that they are significant in ways they may not realize.
         </blockquote> The Fred philosophy means: 
         <br>
         <br>• Leading by example 
         <br>• Starting with what’s right instead of what’s wrong 
         <br>• Encouraging people to try 
         <br>• Asking for and sharing good ideas 
         <br>• Removing barriers and obstacles 
         <br>• Being a champion of those around you 
         <br>• Giving people the freedom they need 
         <br>• Teaching the Fred philosophy consistently 
         <br>• Recognizing and rewarding 
         <br>• Make the process enjoyable 
         <br>
         <br>“It’s our choice whether we’ll use our time, effort, and talents to turn ordinary work into something extraordinary.” writes Sanborn. It begins as always, with integrity. If you value it, those around you will too. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>Fred 2.0</i> will show you the thinking behind extraordinary leadership and apply it in every area of your life. “When you know what is important to you in your life and work, you should apportion your talents and efforts so you can give the best you have to those things.” Love what you do and love the people you do it with.

         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781609946449.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781609946449sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div>We like to think of our leaders as flawless. We like to be perceived as flawless—or at least we like people to think we have everything under control. But as Joe Badaracco has pointed out, “
         <b>leadership is a struggle by flawed human beings</b> to make some important human values real and effective in the world as it is.” 
         <br>
         <br>It may sound counterintuitive, but considering the benefits illuminated by Stephen Snyder in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781609946449.html"><i>Leadership and the Art of Struggle</i></a>, we should welcome it as an important element of the leadership process and our own personal development. Snyder writes that we should face struggle “head on—not hiding from it or feeling shame—because 
         <b>struggle is the gateway to learning and growth</b>.” It can also help us to discover our purpose and meaning and develop the adaptive energy necessary to sustain our leadership for a lifetime. 
         <br>
         <br>Struggles have three defining characteristics: 
         <br>
         <b>Change</b>: Every struggle is triggered by some type of change. 
         <br>
         <b>Tensions</b>: Change creates a natural set of tensions. 
         <br>
         <b>Being out of Balance</b>: Change and its ensuing tensions throw a leader off balance. This may happen without us even being aware of it, but acknowledgement of it is central to regaining control. 
         <br>
         <br>In the world we live in today, this is a common occurrence often leading to burnout unless we learn to see struggle through a different lens. Snyder recommends: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Adopt a growth mindset.</b> The first step in accomplishing this is through reflection—being aware of what is going on around you. Snyder’s former colleague at Microsoft, Frank Gaudette, used to say: “I reserve the right to wake up smarter every day.” A good mantra to make our own. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Center your mind, body and spirit.</b> We all need some way to anchor ourselves and gain perspective that we practice daily like exercise and diet, prayer, connecting with nature, meditation, and/or journaling. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Build your support community.</b> “Create a community of people whom you can connect and bond with and from whom you can seek advice and feedback.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Overcome your blind spots.</b> Blind spots by their very nature are hard to recognize. And they are frustrating because they blind us from seeing why people may be responding to us in counterproductive ways—leading us to finger pointing rather than personal responsibility. “Blind spots,” writes Snyder, “are the product of an overactive automatic mind and an underactive reflective mind.” 
         <br>
         <br>A fairly common blind spot Snyder calls the 
         <i>Conflict Blind Spot</i>. This blind spot can cause someone to interpret every interaction through a distorted lens. It reinforces the perception that the other person is wrong and we are right. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Recommit, pivot, or leap.</b> When we struggle we have essentially three options. The first is to recommit and stay the course. The second is to pivot and make a course correction. And third is to leap into uncharted territory far beyond our comfort zone. Choosing the right option requires that we examine ourselves and determine which choice is most consistent with our personal values or mission statement. 
         <br>
         <br>Every struggle is a chance to learn and to confront who we are and what we are becoming. Seen in that light, they are a gift. And our ability to deal with our own struggles effectively has an impact on those around us. Not only does it create a more positive environment to function in, but it provides a constructive example for others to follow. 
         <br>
         <br>Snyder has written an outstanding and practical book to help us to rethink the challenges and problems we face along the way. One of the best you’ll ever read on the topic. 
         <br>

To become a 
         <b><i>CEO of your own destiny</i></b>. 
         <br>
         <br>Less than half of Americans (47 percent) are satisfied with their work. Companies are changing too. They can no longer provide the safety nets that were expected in the last century. Employees must become more self-reliant. That of course means a workplace that rewards people for their performance rather than their time in. An organization that supports entitlement over results, writes Webb, “can limit growth and opportunity.” 
         <br>
         <br>Giving someone a leg-up is one thing, entitlement has a permanence to it that both hinders employees and harms companies and neither performs up to their maximum potential. 
         <br>
         <br>Webb believes that technology presents us with an opportunity. It has the power to enable people to do something about their dissatisfaction with work and move on to careers that can provide both fulfillment and financial security. “
         <b>Understanding and embracing today’s technological trends is the fastest way to travel to the career of your dreams.</b>”

         <b>CEO of Your Own Destiny</b>, 
         <b>Disenchanted Employee</b>, and 
         <b>Aspiring Entrepreneur</b>. Where we should all be headed, states Webb, is to the mindset of the CEO of Your Own Destiny. We are living in the age of the entrepreneur. 
         <blockquote>
          Prior to the Civil War, most Americans worked in agriculture or as small merchants or tradesmen. Success was the result of self-direction, self-motivation, and self determination. In a way, everyone was self-made. 
          <br>
          <br>The Industrial Revolution brought opportunities to work outside the home, reversing the entrepreneurial spirit and giving rise to the paternalistic company, but now the Age of Entrepreneurship is bringing it back. 
         </blockquote> Today personal and professional development is on the employee. It “requires you to be relevant every day and to be voted on to the team you want to play with.” But with this freedom come accountability. In an entrepreneurial age it is more important than ever that you think like a leader—no matter where or at what level you work. 
         <br>
         <br>As research indicates, 
         <b>many people find themselves in the Disenchanted Employee frame</b>: you are waiting to be discovered or recognized, you don’t understand why others don’t see how good you really are, your career isn’t going as expected, and you believe your circumstances are someone else’s fault. 
         <br>
         <br>This kind of thinking is not just unproductive, it feeds on itself and keeps you just where you don’t want to be. One of the most important things you can do is to get a mentor; someone to help you see the reality of your situation and offer constructive advice to get you moving again. Webb also offers these ideas: 
         <ol>
          <li>Make sure you do something every day to <b>show others you deserve</b> to be a part of their team.</li> 
          <li><b>Have a great attitude.</b> You might be brilliant, but if you are hard to manage, it’s easy to find someone else.</li> 
          <li><b>Work for a higher purpose.</b> Your job has more impact than just making money.</li> 
          <li><b>Pick your battles.</b> Fight only about things that are really important and that will move the needle.</li> 
          <li><b>Don’t be afraid of change.</b></li> 
          <li><b>Be brutally honest with yourself.</b> Know your strengths and weaknesses. It does you no good to kid yourself here.</li> 
          <li><b>Don’t confuse action with traction.</b> Focus on outcomes, not face time. </li> 
          <li><b>Focus on expanding your sphere of influence</b>; it will give you the opportunity to have an impact over more areas.</li> 
          <li>Take time to <b>sit back and reflect</b> on where you are and where you want to be. Make time for a “compass check.”</li> 
          <li><b>Be brave and be bold.</b> Most things worth doing are hard.</li>
         </ol> Technology is pushing flexibility in the workplace. Technology doesn’t replace the need for human contact but it can make work more efficient and face time more rewarding. It provides the opportunity to create how you do your work in new ways if you are willing to perform. Outcomes become more important than ever. If you give more you will receive more.

         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781118436264.html"><i>Where Winners Live</i></a> by Dave Porter and Linda Galindo is a book oriented towards sales professionals, but the issue it deals with is important (vital) to us all—personal responsibility. 
         <br>
         <br>Winners live in a mindset of 100 percent accountability. Accountability, say the authors is taking responsibility for the “success and failure of everything you do—for your choices, behaviors, and actions—
         <b><i>before</i> you know how it will turn out</b>” (even if you’re working with someone else). 
         <br>
         <br>If you’re not living the personal responsibility mindset where winners live then you might be displaying what the authors call loser characteristics: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Victim</b>: If you live in a world where circumstances beyond your control dictate your success, you have no power. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Finger-Pointer</b> “owns” only the good. If it is good, I did it; if it is bad, you did it. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Robbery Victim</b> always blames someone else for undermining him, for getting something he deserved instead, or for scoring a win at her expense. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Coulda-Woulda</b> tries to take credit for what she didn’t earn by saying she easily could have, if only … (take your pick of excuses). 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Guess Man</b> knows that there is no accountability without clarity. The more vague he is with his instructions, the easier it will be to blame someone else when the job doesn’t go well. 
         <br>
         <br>

         <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is a guest post by Robert Smith, author of <i><a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780849948541.html">20,000 Days and Counting</a>: The Crash Course For Mastering Your Life Right Now</i>. He asks, "<b><i>What if you were able to accomplish MORE TODAY than most people accomplish all year?</i></b>" Decisions you make right now can change your life forever. …We do choose how we will live. May you have a glorious ending by beginning today.</font> 
         <br>
         <br>A HUGE difference between the leaders who make things happen and those who do not is how they prioritize their time. 
         <br>
         <br>Leaders who make things happen schedule their lives around what needs to get done. Leaders who don’t make things happen do the exact opposite, scheduling what needs to get done around their lives. 
         <br>
         <br>The difference is priorities. 
         <br>
         <br>If meeting your deadline isn’t more important than going to the football game or getting eight hours of sleep, then you probably don’t have what it takes. 
         <br>
         <br>I’m not saying that football is bad. I’m just saying that I simply 
         <i>cannot</i> go. I just can’t get it all done in time and still catch a four-hour game. If you want to lead a team of people who are so invested in your vision that they are willing to sacrifice certain things to help you accomplish it, then the sacrifices must first start with you. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Ask yourself this question: What are most people spending time on that I could probably live without?</b> 
         <br>
         <br>You must be intense about finishing on a deadline, and that might mean sacrificing a lot of recreational things. 
         <br>
         <br>The key is to know thyself. 
         <br>
         <br>You know what you need to get done, and you ought to know how long it will take you to finish it. If you’re serious about making it happen, you must design days around completing what you know needs to be completed in order to make things MOVE. 
         <br>
         <br>Here’s another hint: 40 hours a week won’t cut it. 
         <br>
         <br>If you’re spending half the “workday” cleaning out your inbox, maybe its time to start waking up at five. 
         <i>Leadership is not exclusive to eight-hour windows.</i> You have to set the tone. If you possess a 9-5 mentality, so will the people you are leading. 
         <br>
         <br>Every leader I’ve met who is really killing it puts in an average of around 
         <i>80 HOURS PER WEEK</i>! 
         <br>
         <br>Leaders have to think like entrepreneurs. It’s funny to me that I’ve never seen an entrepreneur just standing around the water cooler with a cup of coffee. The doers don’t have time for that; they’re too busy grinding away. 
         <br>
         <br>The bottom line is that success is built by chunks of time. And a successful leader has that time built in. 
         <br>
         <br>If you’re truly serious about making it happen, put your minutes where your mouth is. 
         <br>
         <br>Of course, if you are that serious, you probably already do. Keep it up! 
         <br>
         <br>

         <h2 class="title">It’s Not About the Bike: A Lesson from Lance Armstrong</h2> Lance Armstrong once wrote: “I believed I had a responsibility to be a good person, and that meant fair, honest, hardworking and honorable. If I did that, if I was good to my family, true to my friends, if I gave back to my community or to some cause, if I wasn't a liar, a cheat, or a thief, then I believed that should be enough.” 
         <br>
         <br>Often we begin the race with solid values. We begin with values that drive our behavior based on intrinsic rewards. But over time, 
         <b>something can happen if we are not careful</b>. Competitive pressures weigh on us. The chance for extrinsic rewards like money and power loom larger. If we have not built the strength of character to resist those temptations, we can easily become the person we don’t recognize. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="img" style="margin: 3px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">

         </div> 
         <b>Success also seduces us.</b> It brings with it its own kind of pressure. When we win we get rewards from unexpected places. Strangers think we're amazing. They think we’re smarter than we are. They want our opinion about things we really know very little about. It feels good. We’re on a roll. We want to keep this going. It now becomes about the win. No longer driven by intrinsic rewards, our focus turns to extrinsic values and rewards like money, power, and fame. Our values become defined by what is going on outside rather than what is going on inside of us. And our choices reflect that shift. 
         <br>
         <br>The fact is, 
         <b>success changes nothing</b>. Our legacy is built on the 
         <i>how</i> not the 
         <i>what</i>. 
         <br>
         <br>Without a strong hold on intrinsic values like humility, respect, truthfulness, patience and honor, we leave the door open for corruption and fraud. 
         <b>Changing what we value, changes everything.</b> More to the point, it changes the choices we make. Choices build the life we lead and the legacy we leave. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>When it’s all about the win, we lose.</b> Good values and solid character build a firm foundation for wins that can’t be taken away.

         <h2 class="title">Why We Find it Hard to Change Our Behavior</h2> We know every behavior begins with a thought. So if we want to have lasting change, the beginning point has to be our 
         <i>thinking</i>. 
         <br>
         <br>Behavioral change is only 
         <b>surface change</b> if we don’t first change the thinking behind those behaviors. And it won’t stick. It will keep coming out in so many ways we won’t be able to keep up with it because we haven’t changed the thinking behind it. 
         <br>
         <br>When we look at our behavior we have to understand that there is a thought going on in our heads that is tripping us up. And we have to change that first. Or we’re working on the wrong thing. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="img" style="margin: 4px 0px 2px 8px; float: right;">
          <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/behaviors.gif" width="200" height="124" alt="behavioral change">
         </div> The question becomes, “What thoughts do I need to change to make my behavior change?” New behavior will automatically follow a change in thinking. 
         <b>One right thought can correct a lot of bad behavior.</b> 
         <br>
         <br>What am I thinking that isn’t allowing me to see things as I should? As human beings, we latch on to certain ideas and assumptions and they blind us from seeing other options and responses to what life throws at us. We get ideas in our head that can literally block us from seeing other perspectives. 
         <br>
         <br>Change doesn’t happen in a moment. We’ve had these patterns of thinking and behavior for a lot of years. We have to unlearn some behaviors and then learn and put into practice the new thinking and resulting behaviors. And it just takes time. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>It’s right thinking over time</b> that brings about lasting change. It’s a process. It’s a long history of repeated behaviors in the same direction that builds character. 
         <br>
         <br>We have to wake up every day and know that we have a tendency—not just because of our life experiences, but also because of the way that we have 
         <i>chosen to respond</i> to them—to repeat a certain set of behaviors over and over again. We’ve got to remember that and change the thinking that supports these behaviors. 
         <br>
         <br>We’ve got a lot of set patterns in our heads that we want to return to, that we have become comfortable with, that we can justify, that we can blame on something someone else did. 
         <br>
         <br>That’s why we have to make a point of reflecting on our behaviors and on the impact we have on the people around us. And learn from it. And then go to work on the thinking behind the behaviors we want to change. 
         <br>
         <br>It’s not what you 
         <i>do</i> that needs to change, it’s what you 
         <i>think</i> that needs to change. 
         <br>
         <br>First change your thinking. The behavior will follow. It all starts with a thought.

          <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/overexposed.jpg" width="250" height="125" alt="Maturity">
         </div> Children today are 
         <b><i>overexposed to information </i></b>far earlier than they are ready and 
         <b><i>underexposed to real-life experiences</i></b> far later than they are ready producing a kind of artificial maturity. Tim Elmore writes in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781118258064.html"><i>Artificial Maturity</i></a>, that “it looks so real because kids 
         <i>know</i> so much, but it’s virtual because they have 
         <i>experienced</i> so little.” He continues: 
         <blockquote>
          Today, because information is so prevalent, our kids assume they have [experiential knowledge] when they only have [informational knowledge]. With an abundance of knowledge, their confidence can soar, but it’s based on a virtual foundation. Without experience, it’s easier for knowledge to produce judgmental attitudes, bullying, and arrogance.
         </blockquote> With all of this information kids think they are mature. And unfortunately, we do too. That’s part of the problem. How often have we seen a “smart” child and thought, “They are sure mature for their age.” Intelligence and maturity are not the same thing. (Of course, we see this same issue in “adults” too.) Elmore writes, “Except in rare cases, their knowledge has only entertained them. It has not produced anything real.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781118258064.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781118258064sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div>Elmore provides reasons for why artificial maturity has become so widespread, but his real focus is what we can do about it. To transform artificial maturity into authentic maturity, we must 
         <b>concentrate on four areas</b> says Elmore: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Emotional Intelligence.</b> Mature, healthy people manage their emotions. This means developing self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Character and a Sense of Ethics.</b> Mature, healthy people live by a set of values and principles. They don’t merely react to what is going on around them. They have self-discipline, emotional security, core values, and a clear sense of identity. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Strength Discovery.</b> Mature, healthy people who become the best versions of themselves are one’s who’ve stopped trying to do everything and focused on what they do very well. This means developing their natural talents and gifts, knowledge base, heartfelt passions, and acquired skills. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Leadership Perspective.</b> Mature, healthy people live lives that don’t just revolve around themselves. They invest their lives in something beyond themselves. A leadership perspective involves a personal vision, responsibility, compassion, and initiative. 
         <br>
         <br>Developing maturity is centered on 
         <b><i>four key areas</i></b>: 
         <ul>
          <li>Provide autonomy and responsibility simultaneously</li>
          <li>Provide information and accountability simultaneously</li>
          <li>Provide experiences to accompany teens' technology-savvy lifestyles</li>
          <li>Provide community-service opportunities to balance self-service time</li>
         </ul> In addition, Elmore believes there are four debts we owe our kids: clarity (fosters focused direction), transparency (fosters validation and vulnerability), consistency (fosters trust and assurance), and boundaries (fosters security). 
         <br>
         <br>There is far too much information in this book to cover it here, but here are a few more ideas from Elmore: 
         <br>
         <br>• Start inserting age-appropriate responsibility into your children’s lives right away. Avoid indulging and overprotecting them and creating hyperinflated egos. We are doing a disservice to young people if we remove their chance to fail. 
         <br>
         <br>• Enable them to take control of their lives; to boss their calendars. Hold them accountable and responsible for the choices they’ve made and don’t bail them out. Let them see that failure isn’t final and poor judgment is not necessarily poor character. 
         <br>
         <br>• Connect them to people (adults) outside their peer group. This generation doesn’t need you for information (they can get that without you), but they do need you for interpretation. They need mentors to help them make sense of the information and the world around them. 
         <br>
         <br>• Communicate that there is meaning even in the small, mundane tasks. Give them a sense of the big picture and how all the little things they do fit into the big picture of history, or of the organization, or of their community. 
         <br>
         <br>Authentic maturity is a leadership issue. Elmore concludes, “Our kids have what it takes inside of them, if we’ll just take them seriously and equip them for the future. As they enter adolescence, we must begin to treat them as young adults and train them to be both autonomous and responsible. Then, I dare you to stand back and watch them amaze you.”

         <br>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781118135013.html"><i>The Wisdom of Failure</i></a> by Laurance Weinzimmer and Jim McConoughey, examines the lessons learned by studying thousands of executives in hundreds of companies. They have discovered 
         <b>three areas where aspiring leaders fail</b>: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b><i>Unbalanced Orchestration</i></b> (leadership failures at the organizational level) 
         <ol>
          <li>Trying to be all things to all people</li> 
          <li>Being in business you have no business being in</li> 
          <li>Entrenched in efficiency: forgetting to put effectiveness first</li>
         </ol> 
         <b><i>Drama Management</i></b> (leadership failures at the team level) 
         <ol>
          <li>Leaders who rule by bullying</li> 
          <li>Problems with dysfunctional harmony—when you want consensus too badly, you miss out on valuable debate</li> 
          <li>Distracted purpose</li>
         </ol> 
         <b><i>Personality Issues</i></b> (leadership failures at the individual level) 
         <ol>
          <li>Hoarding power and responsibility</li> 
          <li>The Destructive path of disengagement</li> 
          <li>Problems of Self-absorbed leaders</li>
         </ol> The authors report that the final lesson, “Does this doorframe make my head look big?” is the 
         <b>most damning mistake a leader can make</b>. The mistake of self-absorption. It’s not surprising since it is the antithesis of a good leader. 
         <br>
         <br>The goal of the self-absorbed leader “isn’t necessarily status, position, or promotion. Rather, their goal is to have things work out the way they think they should work, because, well, they are the greatest.” This is an easy mindset to slip into. And unfortunately, it is almost impossible for a self-absorbed leader to recognize that they are just that. They need outside help, but when confronted, they are sure that the observation is of course, wrong. 
         <br>
         <br>Underneath is all, self-absorption is “rooted in low self-esteem and a feeling of insecurity, as well as a profound discomfort with or disregard for what others bring to the table.” It is marked by “talking big, a sense of entitlement, a sense of infallibility, a lack of empathy for others, an intense desire to win at all costs, one-upmanship, a know-it-all attitude, and an inability to listen.” 
         <br>
         <br>Michael Bryant, CEO of Centra Health explained it this way: “A good leader is like a coach of a basketball team. It is not important for the leader to score the points. It is important for his team to score the points. It’s not rocket science! So the one key to being an egoless leader is to understand the paradox….Self-absorbed leaders never get the paradox.”

         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781582703886.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781582703886sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div>When our performance is in a slump or we get stuck, we tend to become anxious and reach for any quick fix or technique that promises to get us out of it. We apply more effort, focus, and willpower. And when all of that doesn’t work, we get even more anxious and our performance heads even further south. 
         <br>
         <br>Instead, when we get stuck we need to rely on 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781582703886.html"><i>Stillpower</i></a>, not willpower says Garret Kramer. 
         <i>Stillpower</i> is the ability to return to a clear mindset after we get into a muddled mental state—a low state of mind. It’s knowing that “all sentiments are temporary since they originate from your own thoughts and moods. 
         <i>Stillpower</i> comes from knowing that self-worth has nothing to do with winning, losing, parental approval, money, fame, or anything external to you.” 
         <br>
         <br>When we get into a low state of mind we need to do nothing. It’s when we operate from a low state of mind that we usually make mistakes, poor judgments, miss opportunities and dig ourselves deeper into whatever hole we are digging. “Once you understand,” says Kramer, “that as human beings we form our perceptions from the inside out, that the quality of our thinking and level of awareness move up and down independent of our circumstances, you will see that it makes little sense to work yourself through a temporarily low state of mind.” But that’s often exactly what we do. 
         <br>
         <br> When we run into trouble that’s a sign to step back—not a call to action. Negativity is a sign to slow down. We can't perform at an elevated level when we are in a low state of mind. 
         <blockquote>
          A seemingly unresolved issue of today has nothing to do with erroneous thinking of today. And until an individual comes to this realization, he or she will always fall prey to the conditions of life itself. 
          <br>
          <br>Here’s what many of us ought to consider: All human beings exist, from moment to moment, at varying levels of psychological functioning. When this level of functioning is low, most often for no tangible reason, we view life through a dirty lens and are prone to deviant behavior—if we act. Once this principle is grasped, we see that navigating smoothly through life doesn’t have to be so complicated, and unlike the belief of many counselors and coaches in the self-help world, it has nothing to do with personal history.
         </blockquote> Awareness is key. When you are aware of your thoughts and feelings in the moment and when necessary, allow your thinking to clear, then you will have the clarity to act; “insights will flow and answers will become obvious.” He adds, “Insight is infinitely more powerful than willpower. Actually, insight, or having a new idea and/or a change of heart, erases the need for strength or force of will of any kind.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>COACHING</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Kramer notes that when you are coaching or counseling, you need to be operating from a higher level of thinking than the person you are talking to. “What comes out of your mouth is much less significant than the level of mental functioning from which the words are spoken.” We need to interact with people from a state of mind “brimming with love, compassion, and selflessness….External how-to resources are not all that necessary; love will provide all the direction you seek.” 
         <br>
         <br>Leadership is an all-in proposition. Done right, it’s a lot of hard work. To cut ourselves some slack, we too often rely on external gimmicks and techniques rather than the messy work of a real relationship. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>IDEAS TO CONSIDER</b> 
         <br>
         <br>• “We perform better when we get caught up in the experience, rather than when we make the experience about us….When we focus on a personal prize, our options narrow; when we relish the process, our options expand.” 
         <br>
         <br>• “When we act from clarity, it is impossible to get weighed down by judgmental outcomes.” 
         <br>
         <br>• “When we succumb to our errant thoughts or closed-off moods, judge another person, and then act from this egotistical perspective of insecurity, it is practically impossible to find long-term success.” 
         <br>
         <br>• “Every failure, every mistake, every loss—occurs to clarify our path, not to obscure it.” 
         <br>
         <br>• “You will never wrestle with a choice when your level of consciousness is high.” 
         <br>
         <br>Leaders will find a lot to consider here. 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781582703886.html"><i>Stillpower</i></a> is one of those books that makes you reconsider your approach on many things. While Kramer might seem to be throwing the baby out with the bathwater at times, he doesn’t overturn conventional wisdom as much as he calls us on it when we misapply it. It is the perfect prescription for those that have a need to control their world and the people around them 
         <br>
         <br>It is important to note too, that looking within for answers is fine if you have consciously put something there to draw-on in the first place. Good flashes of insight are only produced when there is something good to draw upon. Choose your sources wisely.

         <br>
         <br>Why do people all over the world enjoy participating in games and sports? Why have games and sports been going on for not just centuries, but millennia? 
         <br>
         <br>One of the theories is that they provide immediate feedback. 
         <br>
         <br>The batter in a neighborhood game of softball knows immediately if he hits or misses the ball. If it is hit, it is clear whether it is in bounds or a foul ball. It’s clear if it bobbles into the infield or sails over the fence for a home run. The tennis player learns immediately how the angle of the racket and the strength of the swing can cause the ball to be returned too low and hit the net or if it is hit too high and too hard it goes out of bounds. Indeed, a good part of the joy and appeal of every sport is this immediate feedback. It also enables the player to make an infinite number of adjustments necessary to improve performance. 
         <br>
         <br>It’s important for organizations to become feedback-rich environments in which information flows freely and is accepted and acted upon. It is obviously not enough to simply have feedback given if it is angrily rejected or dismissed because of the source. There is a Swedish proverb that says, “With the eating comes the appetite.” We have found that the more that feedback is shared in organizations, the more easily it is digested and acted upon. 
         <br>
         <br>Attitudes about feedback in companies that have been doing 360-degree feedback for 25 years are extremely different from those doing it for the first time. Within organizations that routinely provide feedback, there is a much higher degree of eagerness to get data. At the same time, there is a calm and ease about being able to dismiss the occasional outlier number or comment. 
         <br>
         <br>Good things come from asking for feedback. Seeking the opinions of others has a host of benefits. It conveys respect. It reduces barriers between the levels. Managers learn valuable information that comes in no other way. Empirically it reduces by 10 percent the number of employees who intend to leave. 
         <br>
         <br>Clearly the ideal is for managers to both give and get, but if you had to choose one or the other, our data suggests that it is better to receive than to give.

         </div> Sara Canaday addresses a vital issue for leaders in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780984659111.html"><i>You According to Them</i></a>: 
         <b>self-awareness</b>. While it is fundamental to our growth, we usually don’t make the time to explore it. And too frequently, we dismiss feedback or make excuses for the insights we receive into our own behavior. 
         <br>
         <br>How we are perceived matters more to our leadership effectiveness than our intentions. We must not only seek out how we are perceived by others but we must do something with the feedback we get. Canaday calls this 
         <b><i>applied self-awareness</i></b>. In other words, using that information to adjust our behavior and close the gaps between our intentions and how others perceive us. 
         <br>
         <br>Typically, our blind spots, our perception gaps exist in those areas where we have overemphasized our strengths. “For instance,” writes Canaday, “do your colleagues think of you as assertive? Or overbearing? Collaborative or manipulative? Gregarious or obnoxious? There’s a fine line between these perceptions, but you can see why the subtle differences can have a huge impact on your career and your future.” 
         <br>
         <br>Canaday discusses in detail nine common perception gaps and how to begin to deal with them: 
         <ul>
          <li><b>Don’t Fence Me In:</b> Highly Productive and innovative? Or rebellious and uncooperative?</li> 
          <li><b>Intellectual Snob:</b> Intelligent and well-qualified? Or condescending and elitist?</li> 
          <li><b>Frozen Compass:</b> Too Direct: Decisive and candid? Or abrupt and insensitive? Or maybe you’re Not Direct Enough: Supportive and personable? Or soft and Lenient?</li> 
          <li><b>Dust in my Wind:</b> Extremely energetic and driven? Or relentless and unrealistic?</li> 
          <li><b>No Crying in Baseball:</b> Composed and steady? Or robotic and indifferent?</li> 
          <li><b>Safety Patrol:</b> Methodical and compliant? Or inflexible and overly cautious?</li> 
          <li><b>Faulty Volume Control:</b> Volume Too Low: Understated and humble? Or bland and forgettable? Or perhaps you’re Volume Too High: Assertive and enthusiastic? Or self-serving and inappropriate?</li> 
          <li><b>Passion Pistol:</b> Spirited and passionate? Or intense and overzealous?</li> 
          <li><b>Perpetual Doer:</b> Remarkably reliable and high performing? Or one-dimensional and over-functioning? </li>
         </ul> 
         <b>Self-awareness flourishes in a person that accepts personal responsibility.</b> Without it, we only seek to justify what we do. We never quite get to dealing with those areas where we mean well but are coming across badly. 
         <br>
         <br>Whether we like how we are coming across to others or not, it is our reality. It is crucial that we seek out our perception gaps and deal with them if we are to be effective and grow as leaders. “No one is so amazingly self-aware that he or she can clearly see and eliminate every potential perception disconnect before it occurs. Those who are the most successful have just learned how to read the diverse people and situations they encounter and respond appropriately.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>You According to Them</i> is a great place to start. Canaday places an emphasis throughout this book on “actively working to understand our reputations and artfully managing the perceptions that directly impact our careers.”

         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781937134211.html"><i>The Leader’s Climb</i></a> by Bob Parsanko and Paul Heagen is a business fable about learning to counteract the growing pressure to go too fast, fight too much, and force too many decisions. 
         <br>
         <br>There is an alternative to this pressure we all feel. Throughout the story—an exercise in itself to create space, slow down and become more aware—the author’s stress three qualities to strengthen your leadership: Awareness (slowing down), Acceptance (embracing reality), and Abundance (considering multiple options). 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>The Leader’s Climb</i> is well written and nearly everyone will recognize patterns of behavior found in the story’s main character Adam, in themselves. The authors provide a lot to think over. Here are some excerpts: 
         <br>
         <br>It’s not hard to see the impact on organizations of leadership that focuses primarily on speed, efficiency, results, and financial return. The same issues come up over and over again. The tyranny of the urgent becomes a substitute for planning and prioritization. Snap decisions with hidden costs replace careful consideration with obvious time requirements. Mindless compliance replaces community and commitment. Activity that looks like momentum disguises chaos. Purpose is sacrificed to performance at any cost. 
         <br>
         <br>Removing what does 
         <i>not</i> matter is the first step in figuring out what 
         <i>does</i>. 
         <br>
         <br>I’m afraid we often find it easier to fight an obstacle or pretend it’s not there, rather than accept it for what it is and use it to accomplish something worthwhile. 
         <br>
         <br>Acceptance does not mean quitting. 
         <br>
         <br>Activity is not the only sign of progress. 
         <br>
         <br>[Personal responsibility and self awareness.] I’d be a little more careful about seeing 
         <b><i>who</i></b> is on the way before you throw your words around. Someone might get hurt. 
         <br>
         <br>[The challenge.] You’re becoming more consciously aware of what’s going on around you and what’s going on within you. We just need to find where they fit together. 
         <br>
         <br>Most of the time, when people think they are at cross-purposes, it is simply that they don’t know each other well enough. So they speculate or assume, which almost always goes to the wrong place. 
         <br>
         <br>Nothing’s authentic when you try too hard and others see right through it.

         </div>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780749465247.html"><i>Adaptability</i></a> is a book about how people adapt. It is about how to win more often. “In the future,” writes author Max McKeown, “you can try to maintain what you already have, or you can attempt to transcend the constraints of your situation.” 
         <br>
         <br>Of course, to begin, you have to recognize the need to adapt. That’s not always as easy as it sounds mainly because we have to admit that something isn’t right. You have to understand what’s going on. Enthusiastic ignorance often rules the day. And so as, McKeown points out, “
         <b>stupid survives until smart succeeds</b>.” Knowing the rules and when to break them is essential to successful adaptability. 
         <blockquote>
          <b>If you find a system failing, then you have also found a system that is failing to adapt.</b> You need to discover, first, what adaptations are needed for the system to succeed. Second, you should understand what has stopped the system from adapting successfully. And third, you should find out how to free the people in the system to make the necessary adaptations.
         </blockquote> Once you recognize the need to adapt, you need to understand what adaptation is required. In times of great uncertainty, we need the knowledge creators, the radical and the rebels. “When times are easy, almost anyone can look effective….When choices seem obvious, unimaginative leaders may be rewarded for making the obvious choices even when they know they’re the wrong choices.” 
         <br>
         <br>Leaders too, need to release its stranglehold on what is considered acceptable and unacceptable thought. Effective adaptation will not happen when there is a dominance of a couple of people over the way everyone else is allowed to think and act. 
         <br>
         <br>It is important to not only identify what needs to be done, but to keep on learning until you get it right. Something to think about: 
         <blockquote>
          Most people lock on to a particular course of action, they make their minds up early and fail to adapt to evidence that their choices are wrong. As a result, only a small portion of most people’s experiences lead to new learning.
         </blockquote> Finally, you need to actually make the changes necessary to adapt. “The most successfully adaptive companies are those that never grow up.” It is rare to find leaders that are comfortable with “learning what is necessary from the people who do the work and know the answers.” McKeown rightly observes that being all knowing is not a human quality. 
         <br>
         <br>When attempting to adapt, “it is very tempting to try to remake a new situation to match an old situation.” We tend to continue to do what we already know. 
         <br>
         <br>“In adaptive terms, if you are still in the game, then it’s always the beginning.” This is a critical mindset for successful adaptation. “You can imaginatively rethink your actions so that wherever you are becomes the best place to start.”

         </div>Bill Lane was Jack Welch’s speechwriter for nearly two decades. In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780133040241.html"><i>Losing It</i></a>, he draws on his experiences primarily at GE to highlight the behaviors that are career killers. Naturally, Welch figures into much of this book. Reading the stories you might recognize a few areas where you may need to rethink your approach or behavior. 
         <br>
         <br>Most of his insights are the kind of common sense that we easily see overlooked by others but forget to put into practice in our own lives. Here is a selection of ideas to think about: 
         <br>
         <br>The best advice I can give anyone in management in business, organizations, politics, the military, or life in general is to fight and strive endlessly to expand your responsibilities and 
         <i>never</i> stop, 
         <i>never</i> coast, 
         <i>never</i> get comfortable, no matter how many people tell you how great you are and how well you are doing. 
         <br>
         <br>“Show off” with actions, never words. 
         <br>
         <br>“You need to ask yourself every day of your career, ‘Am I up to speed? Am I pushing the envelope, or am I stagnating and falling behind?’” Are you still living off the same achievement you had 20 years ago? 
         <br>
         <br>The ultimate sustainable advantage in your career is the 
         <b>ability to learn</b>. 
         <br>
         <br>Incuriosity leaves you vulnerable to lies and dissembling. 
         <br>
         <br>Good leaders put their heads down and do what has to be done, within the inflexible ropes of absolute integrity. 
         <br>
         <br>“Superficiality—[managing at too high a level] – leads you to decisions that I think are ‘glossy’—made at too high a level, without real understanding of the data—and leads to decisions that do not account for key data, such as risk.” Without real diligence, the organization slides into a mindset of slack. 
         <br>
         <br>“Uninvolved” emperors or empresses (at any level) usually design elaborate and sometimes clever mechanisms to protect themselves from the vulnerabilities and snickers caused by their feckless or disconnected behavior. 
         <br>
         <br>Very few people have ever gotten hurt by keeping their mouths shut.

         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Communication</b> — How well do you listen, ask questions, and speak with influence? How many of our problems are caused by lack of listening? 
         <br>
         <br>We listen better to people we like, but we can learn to listen with liking to anyone. What prevents us from doing so is preconceived ideas and ideas that we have about someone. “Sometimes while listening to someone, thoughts flood your mind – “can this person do anything for me?” “I probably won’t like this person,” or “Who likes them anyway?” – influencing how you listen.” Listen with liking. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Leading Teams</b> – How well do you establish trust, healthy conflict, and achieve results with others? 
         <br>
         <br>A culture of blame teaches people that they can avert their own responsibility by blaming others. “When you breed and teach a culture of no accountability, it’s very hard to reach anything above mediocrity.” Without accountability you can’t lead. Papp suggests five ways to hold yourself accountable: 1. Don’t overextend yourself; 2. Take action before you speak. Actions speak louder than words; 3. Have an accountability partner; 4. Chart your progress. Write down daily or weekly actions that chart your continual growth; 5. Aim for consistency, not perfection. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Productivity</b> – How well do you spend your time and how focused are you? 
         <br>
         <br>You are responsible for being productive. Know where your time is going, plan the day before, focus on high-payoff items, and delegate for results and not the process. (Forcing someone to do things your way is not delegating for results. It makes for a very stressful environment and is also counterproductive.) 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Personal Development</b> – What are you doing to develop yourself? 
         <br>
         <br>Where do leaders find their inspiration? “When we retreat to silence, we tap into the inner calm that allows us to search for answers.” Lead with silence. 
         <br>
         <br>We must learn to deal with stress. Papp suggests that we enjoy silence, create a gratitude list, get your sleep and take naps, allow for mistakes, help someone (giving is a great stress reducer), and make a decision to enjoy life.

         </div>If you’re trying to make a significant contribution you will have to influence people you can’t control. In other words, you will need to influence up. 
         <br>
         <br>Often we get in our own way when trying to influence. In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781118038451.html"><i>Influencing Up</i></a>, authors Allan Cohen and David Bradford we have to overcome these barriers: 
         <ul>
          <li>The assumptions you hold about how hard to push</li> 
          <li>An unwillingness to raise a tough issue or have a difficult conversation with your boss</li> 
          <li>A combative tone that provokes the exact reactions you dislike</li> 
          <li>Fear of being turned down</li> 
          <li>Inability to let go of your own concerns long enough to remember to give something valuable to get cooperation</li> 
          <li>Any problems you might have dealing with authority</li>
         </ul> Cohn and Bradford deal with all of these issues. Beside any self-examination you will need to do, you will need courage to deal with two influencing up issues: 
         <br>
         <br>First, 
         <b>the impact of large power differentials</b>. Obviously, the greater the power differential between you and the powerful person, the more difficult influence becomes. 
         <blockquote>
          Unfortunately, this kind of large power gap tends to produce dysfunctional behavior for people on both sides of the equation. Relatively high-power people tend to overvalue their own contributions and undervalue others’, whereas those with less authority tend to overestimate higher-level individuals’ power and underestimate their own.
         </blockquote> Second, 
         <b>becoming a partner with high-powered people</b>. Partner does not necessarily mean equals. It’s a matter of “joining with” not just “reporting to” and taking responsibility for developing the partnership. To do that you need a clear understanding of your boss’s world. 
         <br>
         <br>Characteristics of this partnership are: 
         <ul>
          <li>both partners are committed to the organizational goals and the success of the other, </li> 
          <li>you must be motivated by the desire to help and not just personal advancement, </li> 
          <li>you need to be proactive (a leader in your own right), </li> 
          <li>both partners must be honest and transparent, and free to offer honest feedback giving each other the benefit of the doubt, </li> 
          <li>and you must accept the differences between you and your partner.</li>
         </ul> Just as leaders should ask themselves, “Why am I doing that?” so should junior partners ask themselves, “Why aren’t I doing that?” Not all bosses of course, are interested in the idea of influencing up and this is one area where the partnering mind-set really helps. 
         <blockquote>
          You need to carefully examine the interests, power, knowledge, and agendas of every relevant individual, group, or organizational stakeholder—and determine who influences others. Although you might not be able to sway a powerful person, he or she might respond to someone else’s argument. Who has those connections? This complete analysis is critical for selling ideas or proposals, gaining backing for projects, neutralizing resistance, or otherwise making a difference.
         </blockquote> Building on the model they first presented in their book 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/0471463302.html" title="Influence Without Authority" target="_blank"><i>Influence Without Authority</i></a>, Cohen and Bradford deal with challenges of power differentials and partnering and how to overcome them in a step-by-step, straightforward way.

         <h2 class="title">The Titleless Leader</h2> Leading without a title is about taking personal responsibility. We—the world—is in desperate need of people who will choose to lead whenever and wherever they can. In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781601632081.html"><i>The Titleless Leader</i></a>, Nan Russell describes where we are: 
         <blockquote>
          Everything isn’t alright in our workplaces. People are frustrated, angry, disillusioned, tired, and afraid. Not to mention skeptical, cynical, and distrustful. And those plaques touting people as the most important asset should be taken down. They’re a hypocritical reminder of last century’s failed promise. Not everywhere, of course, but in far too many organizations.
         </blockquote> But we have a choice. 
         <blockquote>
          We can continue the de-motivating spiral of self-indulgent, unaligned leaders, or we can decide to create tomorrow’s workplaces through a new kind of leadership. It’s the kind that doesn’t come with a title. It’s not determined by rank, responsibilities, or position. No one needs to appoint you, promote you, or nominate you. You decide.
         </blockquote> What Russell is talking about here is a different kind of leadership that starts with what all good leadership begins with: self-discipline. It is taking responsibility for the outcomes in your area. It’s setting an example of behaviors that are aligned with values. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781601632081.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781601632081sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div>For Russell, titleless leadership is based on four cornerstones: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Self-Alignment</b>: Behavioral integrity. People remember what you are. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Possibility Seeds</b>: Encourages and nurtures others. Titleless leaders plant possibility seeds “not because there’s a mentoring- or succession-planning program, but because they’re operating with a better together approach.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Soul Courage</b>: Step-up and offer your best self. Push outside your comfort zone to do the right thing. 
         <br>
         <br>and 
         <b>Winning Philosophies</b>: It’s only when we’re all winning that we truly all win. Focus on group wins and not the politics of individual wins. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>The Titleless Leader</i> is a handbook of behaviors and thinking to help you lead from where you are. Certainly, they’re not easy and require some change in perspective, but they will create more meaning and value in your workplace and more importantly, 
         <i>in your life</i>.

         <h2 class="title">Negativity Loops Destroy Intention</h2> When the stakes are high, negative thinking is a no-brainer; it comes naturally to any of us. Living intentionally is the path to success, but what happens when our intentions are derailed? When things aren’t going as planned? 
         <br>
         <br>Kristi Hedges is an expert in executive presence. In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780814417737.html" title="Power of Presence" target="_blank"><i>The Power of Presence</i></a> she describes presence as “
         <b>how people move through the world</b>.” It is how people perceive you over time. Negativity dramatically affects your ability to lead. 
         <br>
         <br>Negativity pulls us down and inward. Positivity pulls us up and outward. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Negative thoughts have two characteristics: they are permanent and universal.</b> As in, “They are…” “It is…” and “I’m not.” Hedges says, “People who maintain optimistic thoughts gain resilience. When they have setbacks, they see the issue as temporary and specific, not permanent and pervasive.” 
         <br>
         <br>You have to learn to dispute your own negativity and turn it into optimism. Most of our pessimistic thoughts are just 
         <i>catastrophizing</i> with little or no root in reality. Negative thoughts “Support inaction, excuse complacency, and take away our options for solutions. They destroy our game.” 
         <br>
         <br>When you find yourself in a stressful situation and caught in a downward negative spiral, Hedges recommends that you: 
         <ul>
          <li>Stay vigilant and recognize when it’s purely pessimism and not constructive.</li> 
          <li>Learn to challenge your thoughts before, during, and after a stressful situation.</li> 
          <li>Find a pregame ritual—a repeatable process to get yourself in the zone of your intention—to get yourself into a positive frame of mind from the outset.</li> 
          <li>When you have a physical reaction in a stressful situation, accept that it is a normal response and use helpful strategies to work around it, including taking deep breaths, pausing, and simply acknowledging them. Instead of fighting and resisting a physical reaction, “learn to observe it and acknowledge it as purely a physical effect with no link to your ability to perform effectively.” </li>
         </ul>

         </div> The Enneagram is a method for identifying your personality type and is valuable system for learning about yourself and others. The Enneagram system defines nine basic personality types of human nature and their complex interrelationships. 
         <br>
         <br>Wendy Appel has tackled the Enneagram’s subtleties and complexities in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780984884209.html"><i>InsideOut Enneagram</i></a>. Her book makes practical the Enneagram system by use of clear explanations of each Type, case studies and a structured journaling process. There is a section on Type and team interactions that examines predictable points of tension, reactive patterns, and synergies between all of the possible Enneagram Type pairs. Her goal is to help you to see and think differently about your strengths, your weaknesses, and mostly the subterranean habits of mind and motivations that drive you and others. It’s a journey of self-mastery. 
         <br>
         <br>Appel observes that “most of us focus our attention outward and neglect our inner life. We think that change is out there. Instead of tuning in to the language of our head, heart, and gut, we are busy looking outside, ahead, and down.” 
         <br>
         <br>Understanding who we are, uncovering our blind spots, and creating a game plan to master our thinking and behavior, is vital to developing our leadership potential and to better understand those we lead. 
         <blockquote>
          The subconscious mind, where our habits, patterns, and beliefs reside, directs the course of our lives, and most of us are unaware that this is happening. To transform as leaders and to transform our organizations require that we examine our core beliefs—both individual and collective. If not, we simply make iterative changes, and that won’t be enough to succeed in today’s globalized economy. 
          <br>
          <br>The Enneagram gives you the possibility to transform the way you show up as a leader. Inner change leads to outer change—when your inner world transforms, an opening is created for extraordinary shifts to occur in your outer world. When you 
          <i>lead from the InsideOut</i>, you have the ability to be responsive and flexible enough to act in the moment. Your words and actions are aligned. You take responsibility for creating your life and for leading with integrity and passion.
         </blockquote> Appel says she often gets asked “about the difference between the MBTI and the Enneagram, or whether MBTI Type preferences neatly fit into the Ennegram Types. The most simplistic way to understand how the systems complement each other is that the MBTI describes preferences for how we do things (get our energy, make decisions, gather information, and so on); the Enneagram describes why and how we behave as we do (beliefs, fears, desires, focus of attention), and how we go about getting our perceived needs met.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>InsideOut Enneagram</i> is an opportunity to discover what is working for you, what is not working for you, why, and what you can do about it.

         </div> 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781451618396.html"><i>Flip the Script</i></a> is about approaching everything in your life with a new mindset: you can’t control circumstances but you can manage them. Author Bill Wackermann says that the first step is to “embrace the notion that turning a situation around and creating new opportunities takes the desire to face yourself as you really are and a willingness to see the potential that could be hiding right in front of you.” 
         <br>
         <br>Wackermann believes that anything can be flipped—any expectation can be turned upside down. It is a skill that can be learned and developed through practice. The book is divided into three sections: understanding yourself, navigating how to build your flip, and winning, overcoming obstacles and putting it all together. All three steps are important, but 
         <b>the first section is the meat of the book</b> and the one that requires the most attention because this is where we get in our own way most of the time. 
         <br>
         <br>Understanding yourself and your situation requires honesty. It doesn’t do any good to make excuses here; that only clouds the issues. “Designing your way around obstacles starts with a proper mind-set.” Begin by asking, “
         <b>So what if …?</b>” So what if there isn’t enough money? We are short on people? So what if they don’t come through? “So what if?” is a “mental tactic that allows you to force yourself to consider alternative viewpoints and plan for the worst.” 
         <br>
         <br>Taking responsibility for where you are in this moment, is crucial and once done can actually provide us with a great deal of freedom. Blaming others imprisons us. Wackermann suggests asking yourself: 
         <ol>
          <li>What can I do <i>right now</i> to fix the situation I want to change? It can be a big or small action, but it has to be something.</li> 
          <li>What did I do that contributed to getting me to where I am?</li> 
          <li>What could I have done differently?</li>
         </ol> In conjunction with those questions, you might also ask yourself: 
         <ol>
          <li>Do I blame others? Colleagues, clients, or family members? (E.g., “He never told me it was due today?”)</li> 
          <li>Do I make excuses to avoid responsibility? (E.g., “I couldn’t get to that email because I was traveling.”)</li> 
          <li>Do I ever apologize?</li> 
          <li>Do I complain rather than try to make a situation better? (E.g., “They really need to fix that.”)</li>
         </ol> Wackerman says blame is like candy; too much is unhealthful and will make you sick. “What’s standing between you and success right now is 
         <i>you</i>. Not your folks, not your history, just you. I’m not suggesting that you deny your past, but I am advising that you refuse to live there because it just might kill your future.” 
         <br>
         <br>He covers 
         <b>common areas of self-sabotage</b> like Know-It-All-Ism, My Boss Hates Me, Taking Things Personally, Perception is Reality, and Excusing Yourself. Wackermann leaves you with much to think about. Here are a few more ideas to keep in mind: 
         <blockquote>
          Flipping means managing all aspects of a situation, including the internal and external…A successful flip requires that we not confuse our motives with what the world sees. To move our goals forward, we have to be mature enough to recognize that 
          <b>perception, unfortunately, is reality</b>. That is business, and our actions and behavior shape how others see us and see our potential for growth. The good news is that we can control in way both big and small how the world sees us. 
          <br>
          <br>You can 
          <b>borrow the best</b> of what you like in others rather than fixating on their worst traits. 
          <br>
          <br>The behaviors you do robotically are the ones that are keeping you stuck in your current situation. 
          <br>
          <br>Actions must follow words. If you feel like other people are catching all the breaks, come in early, stay late, and volunteer for assignments that take you out of your job function. It’s called 
          <b>taking the initiative</b>: you need to show your boss that side of you. 
          <br>
          <br>Flipping the script isn’t based on intelligence, rather it’s based on our ability to manage ourselves and control our urges. 
          <br>
          <br>Doing the right thing is so hard because it usually takes much more work, determination, willpower, and self-control than you’d expect. 
          <br>
          <br>To win at politics, don’t complain, and take five minutes a day to build alliances and stay focused on your end goals. Use the 
          <b>ROPE method</b>: Have a good 
          <b>R</b>ole Model, 
          <b>O</b>pen yourself to change, 
          <b>P</b>roject confidence, and 
          <b>E</b>xpress humility. 
          <br>
          <br>In the end, you can’t make people behave differently; 
          <b>all you can do is manage yourself</b>.

         </div>Charles Duhigg has written a book for all of us: 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781400069286.html" target="_blank"><i>The Power of Habit</i></a>. After reading it you will understand how habits are formed and what you can do about it. You will also look at habits in a new way. Habits infiltrate our organizations and become invisible forces to contend with that we never realized were there. Learning to spot them is key to our success. Consider the following story: 
         <br>
         <br>As a newspaper reporter in Baghdad, Duhigg heard about an officer conducting an impromptu habit modification program in Kufa, a small city ninety miles south of the capital. 
         <blockquote>
          He was an army major who had analyzed videotapes of recent riots and had identified a pattern: Violence was usually preceded by a crowd of Iraqis gathering in a plaza or other open space and, over the course of several hours, growing in size. Food vendors would show up, as well as spectators. Then, someone would throw a rock or bottle and all hell would break loose. 
          <br>
          <br>When the major met with Kufa’s mayor, he made an odd request: Could they keep the food vendors out of the plazas? Sure, the mayor said. A few weeks later, a small crowd gathered near the Masjid al-Kufa, or Great Mosque of Kufa. Throughout the afternoon, it grew in size. Some people started chanting angry slogans….At dusk, the crowd started getting restless and hungry. People looked for the kebab sellers normally filling the plaza, but there were none to be found. The spectators left. The chanters became dispirited. By 8PM, everyone was gone.
         </blockquote> In a sense, a community—your organization—is a giant collection of habits. Later, when Duhigg talked to the major, he said, “Understanding habits is the most important thing I’ve learned in the army.” “
         <b>Once you see everything as a bunch of habits,” says Duhigg, “it’s like someone gave you a flashlight and a crowbar and you can get to work.</b>” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/HabitLoop.png" width="300" height="161" alt="Habit Loop" align="right">A habit is the brain’s way of saving effort. Duhigg has broken the formation of habits into a three-step loop: the cue (“a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use), the routine (“which can be physical, or mental or emotional”), and finally there is the reward (which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future). 
         <br>
         <br>The key to remember here says Duhigg is that “When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making. It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. So unless you deliberately fight a habit—unless you find new routines—the pattern will unfold automatically.” 
         <br>
         <br>Breaking habits down in this way makes them easier to deal with. If we can learn to identify the cues and rewards, we can change the routines. We can live life a bit more intentionally. 
         <br>
         <br>Duhigg shows how habits played a part in the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. He goes behind the scenes at Procter &amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, and NFL locker rooms. He explains how improving a single habit rippled out to improve an entire organization—Alcoa. Fascinating material to think about on many levels. 
         <br>
         <br>How much of what you do is on autopilot?

         </div>Whatever you are trying to accomplish, Jason Selk, author of 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780071786782.html"><i>Executive Toughness</i></a>, says a relentless solution focus (RSF) will dramatically increase your chances of achieving it. 
         <br>
         <br>The tactic is this: Within 60-seconds, replace all problem focused thought with solution-focused thinking to dramatically improve your health, happiness, and success. 
         <br>
         <br>We naturally like to focus on and talk about our problems. “We all have the tendency to take the positive for granted. We allow it to become the faint background for the problems we draw in intricate, larger-than-life detail.” A focus on problems only produces more problems. Your mind can only focus on one thing at a time—better to have it focusing on solutions than problems. 
         <br>
         <br>“Anytime you catch yourself focusing on a problem, negativity, or self doubt, as yourself this question: 
         <b>What is the one thing I can do differently that could make this situation better?</b>” 
         <br>
         <br>Any solution, even a partial one will begin to stop the negative emotions. “To ensure you have the necessary perseverance to continue searching for the viable solution, you must first realize that each and every problem has a solution. There’s 
         <i>always</i> a +1 solution that brings you one step closer to a full solution. Most people want a solution that produces complete resolution to the problem….Any improvement, small or large, is a solution: a +1 solution to be precise.” 
         <br>
         <br>Selk, mental toughness is the ability to focus on and execute solutions, especially in the face of adversity. It is 
         <b>built on three skills</b>: developing accountability (consistently doing what needs to be done), increasing focus, and becoming optimistic (confident in one’s abilities). 
         <br>
         <br>Selk was inspired by coach John Wooden and his belief in trusting the process; “give me those things that I know you can give me and I will take whatever comes.” 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780071786782.html"><i>Executive Toughness</i></a> explains how to develop mental toughness through the daily practice of ten fundamentals.

         </div>Gayle Beebe has written a book on how effective and moral leaders develop and more importantly, how they must continue to develop. Too often leaders think they have made it and stop working on themselves. Eventually they become leaders in title only. He writes in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780830838202.html"><i>The Shaping of an Effective Leader</i></a>: 
         <blockquote>
          Our understanding of leadership does not come to us all at once. It takes time. In our instant-oriented culture we often want to short-circuit the thinking, reflecting and acting that mark our progressive development as leaders. Understanding how leaders develop and why they matter requires discernment, wisdom and insight.
         </blockquote> Leadership development is a process. Seeking instant results and ladder-climbing can leave us little to show for our efforts. Some leaders “penchant for moving on has allowed them to avoid facing the consequences of their decisions” thereby restricting their development. “They have changed responsibility so often that they have failed to undergo the development that comes from facing mistakes.” Then too, some leaders are so busy “fixing problems” with personnel changes that they never really face the core issue—themselves. 
         <br>
         <br>Beebe draws heavily on Peter Drucker’s teachings and writings. The implementation of these eight principles will have a profound impact on your leadership: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Necessity of Character.</b> “The formation of our character creates predictability to our leadership. Predictability, dependability and consistency: these three qualities ensure that our leadership is reliable and motivates people to place their confidence in us.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Importance of Competence.</b> “Drucker emphasized the importance of a liberal arts education, which he believed was the best training for learning how to synthesize discrete pieces of information into a meaningful whole….All knowledge must be brought to bear on our challenges.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Advantage of Team Chemistry.</b> Generosity builds teams. Greed destroys them. “Eventually it leads to a lack of respect for the needs and ambitions of others because our own needs and ambitions overrun all normal boundaries and expectations….It is made manifest by an excessive need for acclaim, attention or compensation. It also is evident in an inability to share the limelight. Malice and thoughtlessness are twin manifestations of this same inner drive.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Interplay of Culture and Context.</b> Cultures shape people. “An appropriate structure (culture) is the one best suited to maximize the performance of our people.” In addition, “culture is also shaped and influenced by the environmental context in which it exists….One of the biggest mistakes a company can make...is when it operates on the basis of what it prefers and how it believes a society should function, rather than how the society actually operates.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Strength of Compatibility and Coherence.</b> “We have to know ourselves well enough and understand ourselves deeply enough to enter into the kind of human communities that will sustain us.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Guidance of Convictions.</b> “An individual must balance a strong self-understanding and self-esteem with the necessity of confronting all issues both objectively and subjectively….A self-differentiated leader is one who has a head (intellectual capacity) from which he speaks with conviction while having a heart (empathetic capacity) with which he stays connected to people.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Significance of Maintaining Our Connections.</b> “Remaining connected to our work associates even when we make hard decisions is only possible if we maintain personal integrity, display competence, create team chemistry, develop a great culture, retain a level of compatibility that motivates, and display a level of conviction and predictability that people trust.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Opportunity to Make an Ultimate Contribution.</b> The ultimate contribution is in our quest for meaning. “Work, meaningful as it may be, can lose its appeal….Drucker advocated developing a second interest long before we exhaust our first interest. This parallel career becomes not only our lifeblood for meaningful work and service opportunities in the future, but also a source of great support if we were to experience major setbacks in the present.” 
         <br>
         <br>Beebe writes, “These principles do not operate separately from one another. Indeed, they build on each other, and their effect is cumulative.” These eight principles will improve our contribution as leaders if we are mindful of them on a daily basis throughout the rest of our lives. At each level our character is tested and developed. Effective leadership is built on moral authority grounded in character. Leadership is a privilege that we earn every day.

          <img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/5lessons.gif" width="161" height="79" border="0" alt="5 Leadership Lessons">
         </div> 
         <br>Brian Tracy and Christina Stein have written a book—
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781609942809.html"><i>Kiss That Frog</i></a>—to help you root out the causes of the negative thoughts that are influencing your attitudes and behaviors more than you realize. It’s a critical issue for leaders. 
         <br>
         <br>“All emotions, especially negative emotions, distort evaluations. A person in the grip of a negative emotion is incapable of thinking clearly or rationally.” 
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781609942809.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781609942809sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Kiss That Frog"></a>
         </div> Here’s the danger: “The more intense the negative emotion, the more the sufferer becomes detached from reality and is incapable of reasoning clearly. The person then talks and acts in a way that is often unexplainable and destructive.” 
         <br>
         <br>Tracy and Stein have identified five major factors that cause people to create negative emotions and hold on to them: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/L1.gif" width="15" height="15" border="0" alt="1">&nbsp; 
         <b>Justification</b>: You defend your negativity and your right to be angry. Negative emotions cannot exist unless you can justify your right to experience them to yourself and others. The more you justify yourself and convince yourself that the other person involved is 
         <i>bad</i> in some way, that you are pure and innocent and are therefore entitled to feel the way you do, the angrier and more upset you become. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/L2.gif" width="15" height="15" border="0" alt="2">&nbsp; 
         <b>Identification</b>: This means that you take things personally. You interpret what has happened as a personal attack on you. Having healthy emotional boundaries is essential, especially in a work environment. You can be compassionate without identifying with someone else’s emotions. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/L3.gif" width="15" height="15" border="0" alt="3">&nbsp; 
         <b>Hypersensitivity</b>: To be extremely sensitive to the thoughts, opinions, or attitudes of others toward you. Peter Ouspensky called it “inward considering.” In extreme cases, hypersensitive people become paralyzed in that they cannot make a decision without getting the approval of other people. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/L4.gif" width="15" height="15" border="0" alt="4">&nbsp; 
         <b>Judgmentalism</b>: The tendency of people to make negative assessments about others. When you judge another, you become emotional. And emotions distort evaluations. People often judge others because they want to control their behavior. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/L5.gif" width="15" height="15" border="0" alt="5">&nbsp; 
         <b>Rationalization</b>: What happens when you put a socially acceptable explanation on an otherwise socially unacceptable act. Because of low self-esteem and weak egos, most people cannot admit that they have done or said something that was not thoroughly reasonable and justified. 
         <br>
         <br>Rehashing negative situations allows the negative emotions to grow. Keeping an eye on these factors leading to negative emotions can help you to stop the negative emotion the moment it is triggered. 
         <blockquote>
          You have a wonderful mind. But it is a two-edged sword. You can use it to make yourself happy, or you can use it to make yourself angry. Your goal should be to use your intelligence to keep yourself calm, in control, and at peace, no matter what is happening around you or to you.
         </blockquote>

         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781593157135.html"><i>The Compound Effect</i></a> is a reminder of the law of cause and effect. Darren Hardy shares the impact it has had on his life and how you can make yourself accountable for your choices. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Compound Effect is the ripple effect you get from the choices you make.</b> In life, you not only reap what you sow, you reap more than you sow. The seemingly insignificant 
         <b>choices we make daily</b>, will create major changes in your life for good or bad. These are the things we don’t think about because they have no immediate effect. They don’t seem to matter. But over time, they can take you places you never intended. Hardy encourages us to make conscious choices—daily. 
         <br>
         <br>Given the fact that we have a limited lifespan, the earlier we start consciously making small changes in our behavior, the more powerfully the Compound Effect works in our favor. 
         <br>
         <br>Since your outcomes are all a result of your moment-to-moment choices, you have incredible power to change your life by changing your choices. Step-by-step, day by day, your choices will shape you actions until they become habits, where practice makes them permanent. 
         <br>
         <br>Creating 
         <b>habits</b> isn’t easy. Hardy says you have to begin by thinking your way out of the instant gratification trap. “The problem is that the payoff or instant gratification derived from bad habits often far outweighs what’s going on in your rational mind concerning long-term consequences. Indulging in our bad habits doesn’t seem to have any negative effects at all in the moment. But it doesn’t mean you haven’t activated the Compound Effect. 
         <br>
         <br>Hardy also recommends that when we try to change a habit we should 
         <b>focus on what we are adding-in</b> rather than what we are taking-out. Instead of thinking about all of the TV you will miss in the evening, think about the experience and fulfillment you will gain by adding-in a hobby instead. Instead of focusing on what you have to sacrifice, focus on what you get to add-in. 
         <br>
         <br>It harder to get started than it is to keep going, so you must 
         <b>be consistent to keep your momentum going</b>. “When you start thinking about slacking off on your routines and rhythms, consider the massive cost of inconsistency. It is not the loss of the single action and tiny results it creates; it is the utter collapse and loss of momentum your entire progress will suffer.” 
         <br>
         <br>In this regard, it is important to 
         <b>look at what is influencing you</b>. What you feed your mind, the people you spend time with, and your environment will all conspire to bring you closer or further from your goals. Stand guard. 
         <br>
         <br>Finally, Hardy says to multiply your results by going beyond the expectations; doing the unexpected. Uncommon things deliver uncommon results.

         </div>“There are thousands of books on success. But very few on failure,” begins Siimon Reynolds in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781118106174.html"><i>Why People Fail</i></a>. “Yet mastering failure is surely a vital step in achieving your aims, hopes, and dreams.” 
         <br>
         <br>He is passionately driven to take the "taboo" out of failure. As Reynolds suggests it is a "forbidden subject. We're not supposed to fail and if we do, we're supposed to hide it from everybody. It gives people the wrong impression about what it takes to be successful." 
         <br>
         <br>Failure leads to success—if you see it as a process. “If someone has achieved more than you, it’s not usually because they are better than you or smarter than you. It’s because they have discovered a better strategy for success.” 
         <br>
         <br>Reynolds has identified 16 reasons for failure. They are: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>1. Unclear purpose</b>
         <br>Reynolds claims that the reason average people are average is because they have no clear purpose. “It is not unusual to see people working 12 hours a day and still not getting anything substantial done. Why? At the heart of it, their lack of clarity about the best use of their time leads them to work on what’s urgent, not what’s important.” Foggy purpose leads to mediocre results, says Reynolds. Zig Ziglar remarked, “Most people are a wandering generality rather than a meaningful specific.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>2. Destructive thinking</b>
         <br> Not surprisingly, destructive thinking has a dramatic impact on both our health and our behavior. Reynolds recommends the SCORE technique created by 
         <a href="http://www.jimfannin.com/" title="SCORE Method" target="_blank">Jim Fannin</a>. Before you begin a new task, ask yourself: Are you working toward your goals? (Self-Discipline), Are you focused? (Concentration), Are you positive? (Optimism), Are you calm? (Relaxation), and Are you choosing to have fun? (Enjoyment). 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>3. Low productivity</b>
         <br>Getting productive begins with planning before you start. Make a list. Break your work down into blocks of time. Reynolds says that when he’s feeling down or lazy, he likes to separate his day into 10-minute blocks. Working in short bursts boosts his momentum and increased his concentration. This technique he learned from Igvar Kamprad, founder of IKEA. Kamprad says, “Divide your life into 10-minute units and sacrifice as few of them as possible in meaningless activity.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>4. Fixed mindset</b>
         <br>People with a fixed mindset believe that their capabilities are set in stone. They tend to not try hard, give up early, and don’t try new things. In contrast, people with a growth mindset believe that with dedication and effort you can get better. They tend to forgive more, see problems as temporary, learn from their mistakes, and have faith in the future. What would happen if you worked a little harder at something you feel you’re not good at? 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>5. Weak energy</b>
         <br>Success takes energy. Success requires good sleep, a proper diet, exercise, and a balanced lifestyle. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>6. Not asking the right questions</b>
         <br>The questions you are create the things you think about and the direction of your life. You should be asking yourself the following questions frequently: What are my values? What would I do if I knew I couldn’t fail? What could go wrong? How could I make 10 times more money? What would X do? Should I even be involved with this? How would my competition defeat me? What’s the best use of my time right now? When I die, what kind of life would I like to have lived? How could I improve that performance? 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>7. Poor presentation skills</b>
         <br>“Presenting well will increase your confidence and your salary faster than almost any other skill. Your boss will want you to lead more and your clients will trust you more. You’ll feel in command and in control, and others will sense that they’re dealing with someone highly capable and dynamic.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>8. Mistaking IQ for EQ</b>
         <br>A priceless ability for leaders, those with a strong EQ (emotional intelligence) are able to perceive emotions, use emotions, understand emotions, and manage emotions. “When it comes to everyday practical living, EQ beats IQ every time.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>9. Poor self-image</b>
         <br>Self-image is important because it determines what actions you will take and how you will feel each and every day. It’s like your “mental operating software…a mental blueprint of what’s possible for you.” Mostly, you are not your conscious thought. According to Deepak Chopra, about 70% of your thoughts are not new. They are the same thoughts you had yesterday. “The truth is, because of their low self-image most people are selling themselves short.” Think about your self-image and focus on building it up. Act-as-if. Consider the people you socialize with. Are they building you up? Visualize who you could be. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>10. Not enough thinking</b>
         <br>We are obsessed with doing and don’t spend enough time thinking. Brainstorm regularly. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>11. No daily rituals</b>
         <br>Daily rituals enable even average people to become champions of life and ultimately outperform others who seemingly have more talent. “If you can add a structure to your goals, a ritual you do daily, you will increase the chances of achieving them by 1000%.” If you’re not getting the results you want in any area of your life, Reynolds attributes it to a lack of ritual. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>12. Stress</b>
         <br>Stress can kill. Relieve stress with deep breathing and the practice of releasing. You might try list making, dividing your stress into things you can do something about and things you can’t, cleaning and simplifying your environment, getting outside, eating properly and creating order in your life. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>13. Few relationships</b>
         <br>You can’t get there alone. You must enlist the help of many others along the way. Develop your ability to develop strong personal relationships. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>14. Lack of persistence</b>
         <br>Giving up too soon is at the heart of many failures for two reasons. The first is a poor self-image. “Deep down they don’t have the faith that they are capable of pulling off a great victory, so when they try, they do so in a tentative, half-hearted manner and are ready to give up at the first sign of difficulty.” And second, they think there is something wrong with failure. Champions know they are going to fail numerous times, so they get on with it. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>15. Money obsession</b>
         <br>Professor Tim Kasser remarked, “The more materialistic values are at the center of our lives, the more our quality of life is diminished.” Research shows that people who focus on the material things are less satisfied with their lives. There is nothing wrong with money, but we shouldn’t build our life around it. Better to focus on relationships, community, serving others, and appreciation. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>16. Not focusing on strengths</b>
         <br>Know your strengths to maximize you natural strengths. Not everything you need to do can be centered around your strengths, but the more you do, the more successful and enjoyable your life will be.

          <div align="right">
           —Thornton Wilder
          </div>
         </blockquote> 
         <br>Sometimes we have big and uncommon things to be thankful for, but mostly what we have to be thankful for is daily, common and mundane. It’s these daily blessings that we take for granted. It’s these that we need to be most thankful for and learn to find ways to express our gratitude for—daily. 
         <br>
         <br>Gratefulness is a state of mind. Gratitude puts us more in the moment rather than being shackled to the past. Without an attitude of gratitude we tend to focus on the wrong things. It makes us do things we shouldn’t do. 
         <br>
         <br>Gratitude assigns meaning to that which we find common, but is, in fact, a gift. At the same time it gives us meaning. 
         <br>
         <br>Often it is not until we are deprived of something that we begin to appreciate that which we take for granted. It is easy to be oblivious to that which we have until we lose it or face the prospect of losing it. 
         <br>
         <br>Do we have to suffer a loss to appreciate that which we have?

         <h2 class="title">Do You Have Moral Overconfidence?</h2> In a recent 
         <i>Bloomberg Businessweek</i> 
         <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/what-should-we-teach-our-business-leaders-11102011.html" title="What Should We Teach Our Business Leaders" target="_blank">article</a>, Harvard Business School Dean, Nitin Nohria stated that because we all suffer from “
         <b>moral overconfidence</b>,” the most important thing business schools could be teaching is humility. He writes: 
         <blockquote>
          Many people view “character” as an immutable trait formed during childhood and adolescence. I believe character development is similar to the development of knowledge or wisdom—it’s a lifelong process. The world isn’t neatly divided into good people and bad people. Most will behave well or poorly, depending on the context….Business leaders need to remember that most of us have too much confidence in our strength of character.
         </blockquote> Nohria is exactly correct. Good leadership is humble leadership. 
         <b>Humility is living in truth.</b> The truth about our limitations and an understanding of our proper relationship with others. And do we share with each other a moral overconfidence—a certain naiveté about ourselves that carries with it the seeds of our own destruction. 
         <br>
         <br>Humility gives us a better understanding of how we are to treat each other. Without it we operate from only one perspective—our own. This kills influence. As leaders, we are to work 
         <i>with</i> people, not 
         <i>over</i> them. It is far too tempting to think hierarchically and not relationally. 
         <br>
         <br>In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/1063-5.html" title="Leading Without Power" target="_blank"><i>Leading Without Power</i></a>, Max De Pree says that “Leaders belong to their followers.” Too many leaders try to create a buffer between themselves and their followers, when instead, they need to be leading from among their followers. A humble leader will close the gap between themselves and others. 
         <br>
         <br>Humility manifests itself in understanding the need to learn. 
         <b>Authority disciplined by humility is teachable</b>. It is arrogant to think that once we have the position or a title, we’ve arrived. We never arrive. It is merely 
         <b>an opportunity to learn from another perspective</b>. If you stop learning, you stop leading. It’s something we need to stay on top of because if we don’t, life has a way of bringing us up short in an effort to get us to wake-up and start learning. Leadership has a way of revealing our weaknesses.

         </div>Ambiguity is not only certain; it is a necessary state for advancing. Jonathan Fields writes, in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781591844242.html"><i>Uncertainty</i></a>: “The more you’re able to tolerate ambiguity and lean into the unknown, the more likely you’ll be to 
         <b>dance with it long enough</b> to come up with better solutions, ideas and creations.” 
         <br>
         <br>The problem is that most of us, to one degree or another react so strongly to ambiguity or uncertainty, that it becomes a limiting factor in our lives and stops us from acting in the face of it. The issue is not so much failure as it is not wanting to “be judged for taking the less-mainstream path and coming up empty.” 
         <br>
         <br>But taking the risk in the face of uncertainty is “not about tempting fate, it’s about going to that place where magic happens.” Living in the question. So how do we push forward when everything seems to be spinning out of control? 
         <br>
         <br>Fields suggests we first find our 
         <b>certainty anchors</b>. Certainty anchors are rituals and routines that we build into our life that help to counter the resistance. On those occasions when you find that it is “Twitter-Time,” rituals and routines will help move the process along. “Ritual helps train you to sit down when you most want to stand, when you’re forced to work on the part of the process that leaves you anywhere from bored to riddled with anxiety.” 
         <br>
         <br>Get feedback along the way. Build a hive of heroes, mentors and champions. Consider ways to bring into the process the very people you are creating for. 
         <br>
         <br>Train your brain in the art of focused awareness through meditation, mindfulness, visualization, and exercise to stay focused and grounded. Randy Komisar, author of 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/1140-2.html"><i>The Monk and the Riddle</i></a>, told Fields: 
         <blockquote>
          It’s a process of stripping myself bare of all the pressures, all of the barnacles that accumulate around you every day as you interact in the world—the pressures, the expectations, the ego, the things that ultimately make your vision unclear.
         </blockquote> Exercise in the list above wasn’t an afterthought. Most of us feel we don’t have time to work out. But we really can't afford not to. Fields, writes: 
         <blockquote>
          Studies now prove that aerobic exercise both increases the size of the prefrontal cortex and facilitates interaction between it and the amygdala. This is vitally important to creators because the prefrontal cortex, as we discussed earlier, is the part of the brain that helps tamp down the amygdala’s fear and anxiety signals. 
          <br>
          <br>For artists, entrepreneurs, and any other driven creators, exercise is a powerful tool in the quest to help transform the persistent uncertainty, fear, and anxiety that accompany the quest to create from a source of suffering into something less toxic, then potentially even into fuel.
         </blockquote> I emphasize this a lot on the 
         <i>Leading Blog</i>, but I think it’s something we really have to work at. Randy Nelson, Pixar’s former head of education said, “The core skill of innovators is not failure avoidance, it’s error recovery.” Fields adds, “When that’s baked into your creative culture on all levels, people become more empowered to lean into the creative abyss—and magic tends to happen.”

And it’s important that we do because that’s where the greatest creations and experiences happen. The poet John Keats put it well. He called it “Negative Capability.” He referred to it as the quality that people of achievement possess: the capability of being in uncertainties. Fields shows how to be okay working in that space.</td>

Great material.</font> 
         <br>
         <br>The workplace has enough challenges and obstacles without us getting in our own way. But too often, we sabotage ourselves. Whether it’s internal forces that cause us to sell ourselves short or it’s a matter of having been conditioned not to “toot our own horn,” people have a marked tendency to avoid the limelight when in truth they belong in it. What’s more, if you’ve always been the ‘unsung hero,’ management wants to know who you are. 
         <br>
         <br>In my executive coaching business, I’ve worked with scores of clients over the years to help them overcome self-limiting mindsets that were holding them back in the workplace. Here are some of the most common issues: 
         <ol>
          <li><b>Not making an effort to be visible to management.</b> Some of my clients were frustrated because they felt chronically underappreciated, undervalued and anonymous. “I can’t get ahead because nobody knows who I am or what I do for this company,” is a common refrain. This is a particularly severe problem where managers are “results-oriented” while paying scant attention to developing the processes and people that bring them those results. <br><br>It’s up to you to ensure that you get credit for your accomplishments. Make a conscious effort to keep your boss apprised of the progress you are making and the projects you complete successfully. If you want to be valued and appreciated, you need to make sure management knows what you are doing and how your efforts contribute to the company’s bottom line.</li> 
          <br>
          <li><b>Believing it’s the boss’s job to manage your career.</b> Career management is your job, not his. Don’t leave your career management up to your boss. <br><br>You may need to take charge of your employee evaluation process yourself. To do this, first get an understanding of how the employee evaluation system works. Find out exactly what criteria or metrics your boss is using to evaluate your performance. This will probably require a sit-down session. <br><br>Once you know how you will be evaluated, you need to prepare in advance for the evaluation. Keep careful notes on all your accomplishments for the company. Put dollar figures on them whenever possible. The more numbers, the better. Then take initiative to schedule sit-downs to discuss your progress throughout the year. Don’t rely on your manager to do it. <br><br>Then, at least a month before your annual evaluation is due, schedule another appointment. Hand your boss an itemized list of your accomplishments for the year. Say, “Here’s a list of the things we’ve discussed over the year. I thought this would come in handy for when you write my eval.” Then let it go at that. If your manager is on the ball, though, and writes your eval way ahead of the deadline, you may need to schedule your meeting even earlier. The important thing is to take initiative and stay ahead of the curve. <br><br>Management wants to make their star employees look good. Some of them don’t have the administrative or managerial skill set to allow them to do that, though. They get distracted and don’t know what a good, solid evaluation even looks like. Managers will appreciate that you took the time.</li> 
          <br>
          <li><b>Failure to notice the opportunities around you.</b> Some workers limit themselves by getting so focused on their immediate jobs and departments that they lose sight of the big picture. One solution: Think two levels up. Make sure you know about the key issues and projects not just in your immediate department, but at least two levels up from you. You should also network within the company and find out who the key players are in other departments. Keep your ear to the ground to learn about new initiatives, particularly in revenue-generating endeavors or where you will have an opportunity to create substantial savings for the company. <br><br>If your immediate boss can’t or won’t promote you, you need to have options. By exposing your talents, skills and value to leaders in other departments, you enhance your chances of gaining a promotion. It’s not just who you know; it’s who knows you! Work hard to maximize your exposure for lateral movements and promotions. </li>
         </ol> 
         <br>Remember, if you don’t take credit for your own success, someone else will. That doesn’t serve your own interests. And if you think about it, it doesn’t serve the long-term interests of the company. You have a professional duty to yourself as well as your company to make sure your accomplishments are recognized and credited to you.

         <br>
         <br>Ben begins with an agenda. His job is to convince or if necessary, to steamroll a manufacturer of high-quality chairs to accepting a merger. Ben’s company believes it to be a good thing, but the target company is not so sure. Ben’s mindset as he starts out is: “how do I get them to do what 
         <b><i>I want</i></b> them to do.”

         <br>Through a series of encounters with a mentor—Aunt Elle—and a lot of reflection Ben comes to understand that it is not about him. His journey causes him to reflect on five lessons: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Lesson #1: Hold the Vision.</b> The hard part isn’t coming up with the vision, it’s holding on to the vision. “As a leader, your job is to hold fast to the big picture, to keep seeing it in your mind’s eye, with crystal clarity, where it is you are going—that place that right at this moment exists 
         <i>only</i> in your mind's eye. And to keep seeing that, even when nobody else does.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Lesson #2: Build Your People.</b> “People have all sorts of amazing qualities and natural abilities trapped inside them. With the wood, it’s knowing how to apply the heat. With people, it’s applying your belief.” If you give people something great to live up to, they usually will. “How influential you are, comes down to your intention. What are you focused on? 
         <i>Your</i> benefit, or 
         <i>theirs</i>?” The more you yield, the more power you have. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Lesson #3: Do the Work.</b> Be humble and stay grounded. Aunt Elle said, “People who achieve great things that the world will never forget, start out by accomplishing small things the world will never see.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Lesson #4: Stand for Something.</b> Lead from who you are. People will figure it out anyway. People need to trust your competence, but they need to trust your character more. “Competence is simply the baseline, the thing that puts you in the game. It matters, but honestly, it’s a dime a dozen.” The authors remind us that you can only lead as far as you grow. Aunt Elle says, “What you have to give, you offer least of all through what you say; in greater part through what you do; but in greatest part through who you are.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Lesson #5: Share the Mantle.</b> It’s not about you. “You are not their dreams, you are only the steward of those dreams. And leaders often get it backwards and start thinking they not only hold the best of others but they are the best….The moment you start thinking it’s all about you, that you’re the deal, is the moment you begin losing your capacity to positively influence others’ lives.” 
         <blockquote>
          Whatever great parenting looks like, it is not about the parent.
         </blockquote> 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781591844198.html"><i>It’s Not About You</i></a> is a great presentation of solid life lessons. A book to be read and passed around. Unfortunately, “it’s not about you,” is not the kind of lesson that once learned, is always remembered. If it was, fewer great leaders would finish poorly after so many years of outstanding service. This is an issue that we face over and over again, but hopefully in ever diminishing frequency and intensity as our leadership matures. This book is a great reminder of the power of the right kind of leadership; leadership that comes from an inner strength of understanding, service and outgoing concern for others.

         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781451626049.html"><i>Practical Genius</i></a> is designed to 
         <b>re-genius</b> you. Gina says we all have the capacity for what she terms, practical genius. It is the “kind of practical, street-level, everyday genius that can change the game for you, your business, and every aspect of your life.” Practical genius is a choice. 
         <blockquote>
          So many of us are unconsciously compromising some of our greatest natural assets because of external factors, past hurts, or current fears. Or, even worse, we have sacrificed our skills, strengths, and passion to the expectations and influence of others. Or we’re consciously hitting the snooze button, rolling over and going back to slept every time we’re reminded how far from feeling happy and fulfilled we are in our work and personal lives.
         </blockquote> In order to identify and leverage both the hard and soft unique personal assets we all possess, Gina has created a 
         <b><i>5-step plan</i></b>: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="img" style="margin: 1px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781451626049.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781451626049sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div> 
         <b>Step 1: Identify Your Genius.</b> Through a series of reflective exercises you identify your hard assets—skills, strengths and expertise—and your soft assets—passions, creative abilities and values. Where these strengths intersect is your own unique practical genius lies. “Reach to the farthest edges, the fringes of your curiosities, and spend some serious time there.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Step 2: Express Your Genius.</b> You must actively and purposefully tell your story. Without visibility, you’re compromising your impact. “A person without a story is invisible.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Step 3: Surround Yourself with Genius.</b> You are who you walk with. Relationships are choices not accidents. Identify others of your “tribe” that can help you amplify your genius. To build a tribe that feeds, supports, and roots for you, you have to feed, support, and root for them. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Step 4: Sustain Your Genius.</b> Find what fuels you. Consider your routines and practice those that keep you healthy, productive, and prosperous. In addition to food, exercise and sleep, “do one thing every day that represents a conscious effort to expose yourself to the extraordinary instead of the ordinary, the profound instead of the pedestrian, the breathtaking instead of the mind-numbing.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Step 5: Market Your Genius.</b> Live and work at the intersection of all your assets. Project your paradox. “Market the scholar alongside the fool. The entrepreneur alongside the philosopher. The conservationist alongside the game designer.” Know your audience and build relationships with them.

         </div> The term 
         <i>work-life balance</i> is fatally flawed says Matthew Kelly in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781594630811.html"><i>Off Balance</i></a>. Meant to deal with the pressures surrounding both personal and professional life, the term has unwittingly created a false dichotomy. You can’t separate the two. In fact, says Kelly, “the term itself diminishes our ability to make the case that work can be a richly rewarding part of a person’s life and should in many ways be personal.” 
         <br>
         <br>What people really want (and need) is not work-life balance, but to “live deeply satisfying lives both personally and professionally.” The trick is to get in touch with your dissatisfaction and then strategically create the life you want. But it will take some work. It’s not going to happen accidentally. Kelly writes, “The life you desire is there for the taking, but it comes at a cost. Life, like business, hinges on the successful allocation of scarce resources.” 
         <br>
         <br>Kelly provides some key thinking to support this discussion: 
         <blockquote>
          We seem more interested in how we want to live than we are in discovering 
          <b>the best way to live</b>. Likewise, we are much more interested in developing self-expression than we are in developing selves that are worth expressing. Personal preference has triumphed over the pursuit of excellence. We want what we want, and we feel entitled to get what we want. 
          <br>
          <br>The problem with all this is that getting what we want is certainly not work-life balance, and getting what we want almost never leads to personal and professional satisfaction. The reason is that very few people have the requisite self-knowledge to want the right things. As we grow and gain this self-knowledge we begin to want what we need because we discover that the fulfillment of our legitimate needs is more likely to lead to lasting happiness in a changing world than the reckless pursuit of whimsical happiness.
         </blockquote> So we need to begin with self-knowledge. “Satisfaction does not arise from simply having experiences and things, but rather from having the experiences and things that you deem important.” Kelly has developed a system to increase the level of personal and professional satisfaction in your life that involves five steps, beginning of course with assessment: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Assessment.</b> What brings you satisfaction? (There is an 
         <i>Off-Balance Assessment</i> in the book and online at 
         <a href="http://floydconsulting.com/index.cfm?load=page&amp;page=65" title="Off-Balance Assessment" target="_blank">FloydConsulting.com</a>) This process says Kelly, allows us to pinpoint an element of our dissatisfaction and create a prescription to overcome it. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Priorities.</b> What matters most to you? (
         <a href="http://floydconsulting.com/documents/Off%20Balance%20Downloads/OffBalance_Priority_Exercise_Worksheet-2.pdf" title="Priority Exercise Worksheet" target="_blank"><i>Priority Exercise Worksheet</i></a> PDF) While these may change over time, it is essential that we clearly define them or we become victims of the tyranny of the urgent. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Core Habits.</b> What are the daily habits that keep you healthy, focused and energized? For example, workout, meditation, proper diet, maintaining relationships. “What one thing, if done every day, would change your life markedly?” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Weekly Strategy Session.</b> What is the key project that should have your attention and be your starting point for each day of the week? Our lives are destined for underachievement and dissatisfaction if we don’t learn to plan and strategize personally. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Quarterly Review.</b> Every three months review what is working well in your life, review what you said you would do in the last ninety days; outline the key objectives in your life at this time; share your plan to accomplish these objectives. 
         <br>
         <br>Kelly says that knowing how to balance various activities in our life to produce the maximum flow of energy is perhaps the most important skill any of us can learn and develop. “Each day has a focus, and holding to this focus plays a significant role in creating and sustaining high levels of satisfaction.” He concludes, “To lay your head on your pillow at night, knowing that who you are and what you do makes sense … now, that is satisfaction.”

         <b><i>interactive</i></b>. We must learn how to interact with the forces in our life that are bigger than we are to create the outcomes we desire. No matter where we are—up, down, or sideways—there are things we can do to mitigate the downs, take advantage of the ups and maximize the sideways times in our life.

         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781414362212.html"><i>Up, Down, or Sideways</i></a> by Mark Sanborn is a thoughtful book born of experience and based on sound principles. It would be a mistake to think of this as another business book. It is, in fact, a 
         <i>life</i> book that will deeply impact your business. 
         <br>
         <br>To be interactive, you first need to define 
         <i>your</i> 
         <b>scorecard</b> for success. Most people don’t live the life they imagined because “they are stuck using a scoring system that doesn’t fit the game they want to play.” Sanborn guides you in developing a scoring system that is meaningful, long-term, and personal. 
         <br>
         <br>Besides a clear scoring system, your success also depends on your 
         <b>attitude</b>. You must develop an optimistic attitude. “The way you look at yourself and the world around you affects your success regardless of the circumstances.” We can choose what we focus on. 
         <br>
         <br>Another important mindset is that of the 
         <b>lifelong learner</b>. “The more you learn, the more prepared you are for whatever comes your way. And the more you learn, the more you develop 
         <b><i>behavioral flexibility</i></b> that provides a distinct advantage over your competition.” 
         <br>
         <br>Sanborn offer six methods to succeed when times are Up, Down, or Sideways. 
         <ol>
          <li><b>Produce Value.</b> Value keeps you in the game. But value is a moving target, so “if you want to mitigate the downsides and increase the upsides, you need to recognize that value is the currency that gets you a seat at the table....keep your pipeline full of the things people value and the people who value them.” Continue to create value in an ever-changing environment.</li> 
          <li><b>Create and Keep Connections.</b> “When we create value and deliver it with service and love, we develop connections that increase our value to others and we multiply their impact on our value.” While creating connections is easier than maintaining them, take special care of the relationships that matter.</li> 
          <li><b>Continuously Innovate.</b> Best practices are not enough. Better to work on “better practices and next practices.” Sanborn asserts that the “purpose of innovation is distinction.” But, and this is important, “it’s not enough to be different. Being different without being valued is being weird. Distinction is being different and valued.”</li> 
          <li><b>Build Reserves.</b> “You protect what you value by building reserves.” We need to build financial, physical, psychological, and spiritual reserves.</li> 
          <li><b>Practice Gratitude.</b> Gratitude is the antidote to negative thinking. In Sanborn’s insightful way, he writes that gratitude is a gift. It is the gift of perspective, energy, guidance, and resilience. Make gratitude something you do and not just feel.</li> 
          <li><b>Embrace Discipline.</b> “Success isn’t based on what we know, believe, or intend; it’s a result of what we consistently do.” Consistently act on your intentions until they become habits. Make time for the most important things.</li>
         </ol> Sanborn gives some final reminders: When you’re 
         <b>Up</b>, you need humility and perspective. So surround yourself with people who keep you grounded. When you’re 
         <b>Sideways</b>, you need a boost. So surround yourself with people who challenge you to keep moving in the right direction. And finally, when you’re 
         <b>Down</b>, you need hope. So surround yourself with people who life your spirits. 
         <br>
         <br>Certainly this is an important book for these times, but this book is meant to help your thrive no matter what life throws your way. You need this book—young people need this book—to prepare for the rest of your life, whether you are Up, Down, or Sideways. Read, reread, and refer.

         </div>Character is built choice by choice, decision by decision. And it is eroded the same way. We often don’t stop to think about how each choice builds on the last until it’s too late. It is a worthwhile practice to think about your choices and where they are leading you on a daily basis. Ralph Waldo Emerson put it well: “The force of character is cumulative.” 
         <br>
         <br>In a October 2002 
         <i>Fast Company</i> article—
         <a href="http://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/the-secret-life.html" title="Character" target="_blank"><i>The Secret Life of the CEO: Is the Economy Just Built to Flip?</i></a>—Jim Collins, explains how character erodes: 
         <blockquote>
          These were the people who, in the presence of an opportunity to behave differently, got drawn into it, one step after another. If you told them 10 years ahead of time, "Hey, let's cook the books and all get rich," they would never go along with it. But that's rarely how most people get drawn into activities that they later regret. When you are at step A, it feels inconceivable to jump all the way to step Z, if step Z involves something that is a total breach of your values.”

         <h2 class="title">What to Ask the Person in the Mirror</h2> While we might like to think otherwise, here is a fact about successful leaders: 
         <blockquote>
          Successful leaders go through significant periods of time in which they feel confused, discouraged, and unsure of themselves and their decisions. They feel as if they should be somewhere else, doing something else.
         </blockquote> And 
         <i>un</i>successful leaders go through the same thing. The difference, says Harvard professor Robert Kaplan, is “how they deal with these periods of confusion and uncertainty. The trick lies not in avoiding these difficult periods; it lies in knowing how to step back, diagnose, regroup, and move forward.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781422170014.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781422170014sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div>This means not having all the right answers, but learning to ask the right questions. The challenge will be asking the right questions and making to the time to reflect on them. Reflecting is the key ingredient here and what many of us are short on. In his timeless book, 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781422170014.html"><i>What to Ask the Person in the Mirror</i></a>, Kaplan offers seven basic types of inquiry or areas of focus—actually a system of inquiry that ties the leadership function together—that you should be looking at on a regular basis: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Vision and Priorities.</b> In this foundational area we need to be very clear and communicate it in a way that helps others to be able to determine where to focus their own efforts. Have you developed a clear vision and have you identified three to five clear priorities to achieve that vision? 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Managing Your Time.</b> Your vision and priorities are reflected in the way you use your time. Track your time for two weeks. How does this compare to your key priorities? 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Giving and Getting Feedback.</b> Most leaders do not effectively coach their subordinates, and also fail to get the critical coaching that they themselves need in order to excel. Do you cultivate advisors who are able to confront you with criticisms that you may not want to hear? 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Succession Planning and Delegation.</b> When leaders fail to actively plan for succession, they do not delegate sufficiently and may become decision-making bottlenecks. Have you identified potential successors for your job? Why not? 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Evaluation and Alignment.</b> It is often extremely difficult as an insider to see where you and the organization have drifted out of alignment. If you had to start again, how would you do it? Would you be doing the same things? Does the design of your organization, your incentive systems, your culture, and even your approach to leading still fit the needs of the organization? 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The Leader as Role Model.</b> Many leaders fail to appreciate that their actions speak louder than their words. Self-awareness is critically important. Write down two or three key messages you believe you send with your behavior. Seek advice from key subordinates and advisors who directly observe your behavior, in order to answer this question: is there a “disconnect” between the messages you wish to send and those you are in fact sending? 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Reaching Your Potential.</b> Know and learn to manage your strengths, weaknesses, and passions, not only to bring out your best, but also to create this same environment and aspiration among your staff. 
         <br>
         <br>It’s not uncommon to find leaders that just stick to what they know best and not address those areas where they feel uncomfortable or insecure. All of these areas need to be reflected on as they each have an impact on the other. Taking the time to reflect is not easy and “doesn’t sound like fun, and may not sound as important as the fifty other things you have to fit into your day—but it 
         <b><i>works</i></b>.” And be sure to take the time to reflect on these issues with your team as well. 
         <br>
         <br>With many down-to-earth examples, Kaplan will expand the range of questions you should be asking yourself. 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781422170014.html"><i>What to Ask the Person in the Mirror</i></a> will help you to rethink unsustainable behaviors that are damaging to both you and your organization and help you to mature and grow in your leadership role.

         <blockquote>
          Behaviors are the tools we choose and use to support our self-worth. 
          <br>
          <br>You can look at personal strengths like behaviors. They represent the different ways a person can interact with others to achieve self-worth. When a person tries one of these strengths and has success with it, they use it more often. Other strengths might have rendered poor results, and so they might tend to use those less and less. Over time, we develop a set of “go-to” strengths. They become our modus operandi. 
          <br>
          <br>But it’s important to remember that you have a whole tool chest of other options that may get you better results from time to time. 
          <br>
          <br>It is possible that some of your conflict at work happens because other people don’t see your strengths the way you intend them to be seen. … So when you find another person’s behavior annoying, look for the strength behind it. 
          <b>What are they overdoing?</b> What are they really trying to accomplish? Most likely, their intent is not to annoy you. If you can find the strength lurking behind the perceived weakness, you’ve discovered insight into that person that may help you understand them better. 
          <br>
          <br>Conflict can happen when other people misinterpret your strengths.
         </blockquote> 
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781932627114.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781932627114sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781932627114.html"> <i>Have a Nice Conflict</i></a> is the story of sales manager John Doyle who has been passed over for what he believes is a well-deserved promotion. He has lost some of his top performers because he rubbed them the wrong way. When he turns up at an old friend and client’s office to explain yet another change in sales reps, he puts him on to Dr. Mac to help him improve his people skills at both work and home. 
         <br>
         <br>Dr. Mac explains to John that there are many ways of interacting with others. We have default ways of behaving and when in conflict we often shift into other behaviors to maintain our self-worth. While we are trying to do the “right thing” to maintain our self-worth, conflict can happen when our “right thing” appears to be the “wrong thing” to another person. Conflict can be prevented by seeing contentious behavior as merely a different style instead of a direct challenge or threat aimed at annoying you or derailing you. 
         <br>
         <br>He introduces him to the 
         <i>Strengths Deployment Inventory</i> (SDI) which is a tool to help you understand the motivations behind your own behaviors and to better discern the motivations of others. By giving you a framework it helps you to understand what you and others are feeling and then helps you be better able to respond. 
         <br>
         <br>Having a nice conflict is about taking personal responsibility for the interaction. To create movement toward resolution, we need to show the other person the path back to self-worth—where they feel good about themselves. That path may be different than yours. 
         <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/SDI.gif" width="175" height="154" alt="SDI" align="left"> The SDI helps you understand those paths. “When we’re stuck in a place of protecting our self-worth, it’s much harder to help others protect or restore what’s important to them. And that’s the primary mission of managing conflict. 
         <b>Managing conflict is about creating the conditions that empower others to manage themselves out of their emotional state of conflict.</b> To effectively manage conflict, we have to begin with ourselves. If we’re pulled into conflict ourselves, we’re usually not in a great position to help others.” 
         <br>
         <br>The concept should be taught in schools, however the thought process is essential for leaders. The book alone offers valuable insights into the process and methodology, but coupled with the 
         <a href="http://www.haveaniceconflict.com/" title="Have a Nice Conflict" target="_blank"><i>SDI</i></a> you’ll have greater success. The authors offer a discount on the

         <h2 class="title">Learn From Your Heroes, but Believe in Yourself</h2> It is natural to want to be like the people we look up to. We want to recreate the success they have enjoyed in our own lives. So we try to imitate them. It seems like the shortest distance between two points. Of course, we are trying to copy a result. What we often fail to see is the work it took to get them to the place where they could do what they do. And sometimes it’s all flash and no substance. 
         <br>
         <br>And while you can try to copy a style, mannerisms, or life path, what makes it work for them isn’t what is written down. It’s what they can’t teach you that makes it work for them. It’s the things you can’t easily articulate that come from the core of your being—that which makes you you—that makes the difference. 
         <br>
         <br>Harvard Business School Professor and former Medtronic CEO Bill George, wrote, “Any prospective leader who buys into the necessity of attempting to emulate all the characteristics of a leader is doomed to failure.” It’s one thing to learn from others, it’s quite another to try to imitate them. 
         <br>
         <br>A big part of the problem is the lack of confidence we have in ourselves. Sometimes in watching the success of others, we lose faith in ourselves. “There is but one cause of failure and that is a man’s lack of faith in his true self,” observed William James. 
         <br>
         <br>Jazz saxophonist Stan Getz took a teaching position at Stanford in 1986. In an interview with a reporter about his role there, he put it this way: 
         <blockquote>
          I’m a strong opponent of imitation. I always tell them that they have to be themselves. 
          <b>That’s hard, because they don’t believe in themselves, they believe in their heroes.</b> And I will tell them: that’s perfectly alright, but your hero is the only one who can play that way. If you want to try and do the same thing, it will only be an imitation, however perfectly you will do it. I keep on trying to convince them that they have to play what they feel themselves. But that’s not easy.
         </blockquote> Your hero is the only one that can play it that way. Be yourself.

         <h2 class="title">Footwashing for Leaders</h2> An easy trap for any leader to fall into is the 
         <i>“Look what I did!”</i> trap. 
         <b>Success easily erodes humility.</b> Humility isn’t about the lack of ambition, but acknowledging the luck, the good fortune, and the contributions of others to your success. It is the humility that comes with a habit of respect for others. Stephen Hall calls it the “gift of perspective.” It is indeed. Humility is all about perspective. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>Fast Company</i> cofounder Bill Taylor argues in 
         <a href="http://www.leadertoleader.org/knowledgecenter/journal.aspx?ArticleID=875" title="Humbitious" target="_blank"><i>Are You “Humbitious” Enough to Lead?</i></a> in the Summer 2011 
         <i>Leader to Leader</i> journal, that “the best way to deliver on an ambitious agenda for your organization is to embrace a sense of “humbition” in your personal style and as part of your leadership repertoire.” 
         <br>
         <br>Taylor reports that “in a manifesto of sorts that urged up-and-coming IBMers to embrace a new leadership mind-set, Jane Harper, a 30-year veteran of IBM and a group of her colleagues offered a compelling description of what it takes to succeed in a complex, fast-moving, hard-to-figure-out world. Their strongly worded advice to aspiring leaders inside IBM should be read as words of wisdom for leaders at every level of all kinds of organizations:” 
         <blockquote>
          “Humbition is one part humility and one part ambition. We notice that by far the lion’s share of world-changing luminaries are humble people. 
          <b>They focus on the work, not themselves.</b> They seek success—they are ambitious—but 
          <b>they are humbled when it arrives</b>. They know that much of that success was luck, timing, and a thousand factors out of their personal control. They feel lucky, not all-powerful. Oddly, the ones operating under a delusion that they are all-powerful are the ones who have yet to reach their potential. . . . [So] be ambitious. Be a leader. But do not belittle others in your pursuit of your ambitions. Raise them up instead. 
          <b>The biggest leader is the one washing the feet of the others.</b>
         </blockquote> Success most often doesn’t come from our efforts alone but in our ability to include and organize the contributions of others; to coax the fragments of a good idea from the hearts and minds of others; from a practiced watchfulness that comes from knowing that a good idea can come from anyone or anywhere. The result, when it comes together—the execution of a great idea—should be humbling to any leader. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>It is humility coupled with ambition that correlates with results.</b>

         <h2 class="title">Does Your Wellbeing Need a Boost?</h2> Gallup scientists have determined that there are five universal and interdependent elements of wellbeing that differentiate a thriving life from one spent suffering: 
         <ul>
          <li><b>Career</b>: liking what you do every day <i>(Tip: Every day, use your strengths.)</i></li> 
          <li><b>Social</b>: having strong relationships <i>(Tip: Spend six hours a day socializing—face-to-face, phone, e-mail.)</i></li> 
          <li><b>Financial</b>: a well managed economic life <i>(Tip: Spend on others instead of solely on material possessions.)</i></li> 
          <li><b>Physical</b>: having good health and the energy to get things done on a daily basis <i>(Tip: Get at least 20 minutes of activity each day and 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night.)</i></li> 
          <li><b>Community</b>: a sense of engagement with the area where you live <i>(Tip: Identify how you can contribute in your community based on your own values.)</i></li>
         </ul> Statistically, while 66% are doing well in at least one area, 
         <b>only 7% are thriving in all five</b>. If we are struggling in any one of these areas, as most of us are, it damages our wellbeing and wears on our daily life. 
         <br>
         <br>Ways to measure and improve in each of these areas is provided in 
         <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595620400/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=leadershipnow-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1595620400" target="_blank"><i>Wellbeing</i></a> by Tom Rath and Jim Harter. (The 
         <a href="http://www.wbfinder.com" title="Wellbeing Finder" target="_blank"><i>Wellbeing Finder</i></a> can be taken online by using the code provided in the book.) 
         <br>
         <br>Our wellbeing will not improve if we don’t make a conscious decision to do so. Small changes can have a huge impact. To get started they recommend setting positive defaults. 
         <blockquote>
          One of the best ways to create more good days is by setting positive defaults. Any time you help your-short-term self work with your long-term self, you have an opportunity. 
          <br>
          <br>You can intentionally choose to spend more time with the people you enjoy most and engage your strengths as much as possible. 
          <br>
          <br>You can structure your finances to minimize the worry caused by debt. 
          <br>
          <br>You can make exercise a standard part of your routine. You can make healthier decisions in the supermarket so you don’t have to trust yourself when you have a craving a few days later. 
          <br>
          <br>And you can make commitments to community, religious, or volunteer groups, knowing that you will follow through once you’ve signed up in advance. 
          <br>
          <br>Through these daily choices, you create stronger friendships, families, workplaces, and communities.

         </div>But that’s not the problem says Marlene Chism, author of 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780470885734.html" title="Stop Workplace Drama" target="_blank"><i>Stop Workplace Drama</i></a>. “The amount of time you stay in the drama—and the effort you put toward it—
         <b><i>is</i></b> the problem. Complaints, excuses, and regrets only serve to keep the drama alive.” 
         <b><i>Your</i></b> drama—what you add to The Drama—is the problem. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Chism defines drama as “any obstacle to your peace and prosperity.”</b> Drama is the result of not recognizing or taking care of the little signs of bigger problems when they first presented themselves. At the core of drama you will find one of three common elements (if not all three): a lack of clarity, a relationship issue, and/or resistance. So, says Chism, when you experience drama you need to ask yourself three questions: 
         <br>
         <br>1. Where am I unclear? 
         <br>2. What is my relationship issue? 
         <br>3. What am I resisting? 
         <br>
         <br>Chism presents 
         <b>eight</b> principles for dealing with drama, but “
         <b>lack of clarity</b>” struck me as the most common and excuse-laden trap there is. Too often this is where we get stuck. 
         <br>
         <br>When we first set a goal we’re clear. In her terms, “we see the island.” But between here and there the process become difficult and someone on your team becomes unhappy, and, “instead of focusing on the island we are trying to reach, we’re now concentrating on pleasing the one person who is upset. Our focus has shifted because we became confused about our number one priority.” And the fog rolls in. 
         <br>
         <br>“
         <b>Any type of discord, abuse, confusion, or game-playing always boils down to a lack of clarity.</b>” A loss of focus. 
         <br>
         <br>Sometimes we create drama because we want something on our terms. We imagine that we can’t do something because we can’t do it the way we think it should be done—our way. Chism relates a clarifying example of this with the recently divorced Joe who is having visitation issues with his ex-wife Patty. She’s not letting him do what he wants in the way that he wants. 
         <blockquote>
          <b>Many people get stuck in the drama of what should or shouldn’t be.</b> Yes, you can fight that battle, if winning a battle is what you want. But again, in order to clear the fog and help Joe get clarity, I asked, “If there are two islands you can go to, and one means winning a battle with your wife and the other island is getting to see your kids and be a father to them—then which island would you choose?” 
          <br>
          <br>He said, “Seeing my kids, but…” 
          <br>
          <br>I said, “No buts. Are you willing to drive to Illinois several times a year and spend quality time with your kids, even if Patty does nothing more than cooperate?” 
          <br>
          <br>Joe said, “Yes.” 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>It’s never as difficult as we make it when we get clear on what we can control and what we are committed to.</b>. The point here is that clarity may or not change Joe’s ex-wife. Joe will struggle if that is his motive or intention. However, Joe’s clarity will give him the essence of what he really wants. If he is able to let go of distractions and not get stuck on the rocks that lie between him and his final goal. 
          <br>
          <br>Do you see that while this kind of clarity may not change all the drama, it will give you peace and free up your energy for more productive endeavors?
         </blockquote> This kind of dynamic plays out every day in our business and personal lives. When we are not clear about what we want, what our values are, what we are committed to, it is easy to lose our focus, to drift off course. 
         <br>
         <br>Solution: Clear the fog. 
         <br>
         <br>Chism has written a good-natured and practical book that will change your thinking and in the process help you to control the drama in both your personal and professional life. As leaders, we have the responsibility to be very clear with ourselves and our team so that we don’t get pulled into negativity, gossip, power plays, resistance and … drama. Chism suggests asking the following questions: 
         <br>
         <br>What are my top 10 principle-based values? 
         <br>What areas of my life or business are in the fog? 
         <br>What are some of the distractions that take me off course? 
         <br>Where do I get stuck? 
         <br>Where can I improve as a leader? 
         <br>What drama do I see on a daily basis in the workplace? 
         <br>What drama do I see in my personal life? 
         <br>Where am I avoiding or procrastinating? 
         <br>

         </div>Justin Menkes says that there are no longer periods of calm seas for leaders in any industry. So it’s not a matter of gritting your teeth and riding out the crisis. Leaders must get comfortable in an environment of ongoing stress. They must be 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781422138700.html"><i>Better Under Pressure</i></a>. 
         <br>
         <br>To do this a leader must possess a “highly unusual set of attributes that often run counter to natural human behavior.” This means leaders must “foster specific attributes to achieve maximum success 
         <b>in themselves and their people</b>. No longer can leaders think of leadership as unidirectional. Instead, 
         <b>leadership “becomes a fluid, virtuous cycle of exchange and growth between leaders and the people they lead</b>.” 
         <br>
         <br>Menkes writes, “Almost every human being alive today has an underutilized thirst for bettering himself or herself. It is up to leaders to discover how to trigger this thirst—in fact, it is a leader’s most critical responsibility.” Recognizing and developing that thirst is something that must be and can be learned. 
         <br>
         <br>He identifies 
         <b>three catalysts</b> that will help a leader to realize his or her own potential and the potential of others: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Realistic Optimism.</b> Striking a balance between the known and unknown. Kevin Sharer, CEO of Amgen, said, “With all the things that are going on in today’s workplace, if you’re not a little bit self-reflective and self-aware, you’re not going to make it.” And you won’t get the best from your team. 
         <br>
         <br>Awareness requires humility. Humility allows you to see yourself as you are. It also allows you to see 
         <b><i>your</i></b> role in any problem. 
         <br>
         <br>Realistic optimism creates a sense of agency—the degree to which you believe your circumstances are within your control. “People must recognize how—and 
         <i>that</i>—their own approach to the problem can either exacerbate these obstacles or bridge the space between two parties.” 
         <br>
         <br>You must learn says Menkes, “to minimize the ways your mind distorts reality.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Subservience to Purpose.</b> While realistic optimism allows leaders to see and address deficiencies in themselves and the world around them, subservience to purpose gives them the 
         <b><i>drive</i></b> to do so. In this framework, “people’s level of dedication toward the mission of the enterprise is paramount, rather than their dedication to each other….Hierarchical distinctions are secondary to the overarching value system that considers the company’s noble missions its most important function.” 
         <br>
         <br>Subservience to purpose means developing 
         <i>affect tolerance</i> or “the ability to channel intense reactions to recurring setbacks in a way that not only avoids hampering you, but also constructively keeps you and your organization moving forward toward maximum potential.” 
         <br>
         <br>It is vital that a leader understand the outsized effect that their emotional behaviors have on their people. Not managing your emotions and reactions—especially in a stressful environment—will hinder other people’s progress. You must temper the intensity of your responses “with the awareness of the unequal power dynamics you share with your team.” This also means keeping in check your sense of self-importance. Menkes writes: 
         <blockquote>
          Grandiosity is particularly costly to you as a leader, because its expression unintelligently telegraphs to your subordinates that you believe the group’s accomplishments are largely due to your involvement. This why expressing humility is so important, because when you are humble, you clearly communicate to others that you recognize the critical role each team member plays in contributing to the organization’s progress.
         </blockquote> Fred Smith, founder, chairman, and CEO of FedEx told Menkes: 
         <blockquote>
          As a founder, you must be able to resist any temptation to let the organization become a cult of personality built around you. FedEx isn’t about me. When I walk out the door here, this organization won’t miss a beat.”
         </blockquote> How many can (
         <i>want to</i>) say that? 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Finding Order in Chaos.</b> This attribute is about maintaining clarity of thought and a drive to solve the puzzle. Maintaining clarity of thought is developed by learning how to manage your stress in such a way that it fuels your focus and increases your clarity. To do this, one must seek out experiences that support your sense of competence under duress—“managing adrenaline without panic and gaining confidence that the sensations that stress induces will not lead to collapse.” 
         <br>
         <br>The drive to solve the puzzle “manifests itself as an intense intellectual curiosity…and a pleasure in finding solutions to them.” Menkes adds, “The positive feedback we get from maintaining clarity under pressure gives us a thirst for more situations that involve pressure, and we are thus driven to solve the puzzle.” 
         <br>
         <br> 
         <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/coaldiamond.jpg" width="195" height="102" alt="better under pressure" align="left">All of these attributes work to develop the other. Understanding things as they are gives you the confidence to face the issues with the mission in mind. Success in this area drives you to remain calm and find solutions to the problems with those around you. “Once you experience the gratification of triumph in the pursuit of meaningful goals, the virtuous cycle of realizing potential becomes a regenerating flywheel that is transmitted to others.” 
         <br>
         <br>Importantly, Menkes reminds us, “people do not act as isolated entities, but are reflections of an essential interaction between themselves and the context in which they are placed….A person’s potential can only emerge as an active process, consciously cultivated through a fluid, ongoing exchange between leaders and their people.” It serves to remind us of 
         <b>the privilege and huge responsibility leadership truly is</b>. To see leadership primarily as a function of authority, is to totally miss the mark. 
         <br>
         <br>I’ve only offered an overview of the ideas Menkes presents here. There are so many more insights in this book than can be provided here. But reading the examples of those who exemplify theses attributes and those who haven’t, coupled with the interviews of 25 leaders, you will come away with a sense of where you stand and a confidence that you can improve in any area you identify.

         </div>Former chairman and chief executive officer of Baxter International, Harry Kraemer, has written a genuine, back-to-basics book on value-based leadership: 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780470881255.html" title="Harry Kraemer"><i>From Values to Action</i></a>. He presents 
         <b>four interconnected principles</b> that build on and contribute to each other: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Self-Reflection</b> is the most important and is central to your leadership. “If you are not self-reflective, how can you truly know yourself?” writes Kraemer. “If you do not know yourself, how can you lead yourself? If you cannot lead yourself, how can you possibly lead others?” 
         <br>
         <br>Self-reflection allows you to transform activity into productivity for all the right reasons. It means “you are surprised less frequently.” It is essential in setting priorities. You can’t do everything. So reflection makes it possible to answer key questions like 
         <i>What is most important?</i> and 
         <i>What should we be doing?</i> in a way that is in line with your strengths and values and organizational goals. 
         <blockquote>
          Engaging in self-reflection on a regular, ongoing basis (preferably daily) keeps you from becoming so caught up in the momentum of the situation that you get carried away and consider actions and decisions that are not aligned with who you are and what you want to do with your life.
         </blockquote> 
         <b>Balance and Perspective</b> is the ability to understand all sides of an issue. Pursuing balance means you will have to grasp the fact that leaders don’t have all the answers. Kraemer says, “My task was to recognize when a particular perspective offered by one of my team members was the best answer….Leadership is not a democracy. My job as the leader is to seek input, not consensus.” 
         <br>
         <br>Because he believes we are more effective if we balance all areas of our life, he prefers the term “life balance” over “work-life balance.” It’s not an either or proposition. “When you identify too closely with your work, you can easily lose perspective and become unable to look at all angles in a situation.” He recommends implementing a “life-grid” to keep track of where you are spending your time and to hold yourself accountable. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>True Self-Confidence</b> is know what you know and you don’t know; to be comfortable with who you are while acknowledging that you still need to develop in certain areas. (Comfortable not complacent.) Why 
         <i>TRUE</i> self-confidence? 
         <blockquote>
          There are people who adopt a persona that might make others think that they have self-confidence, but they are not the real deal. Instead, they possess false self-confidence, which is really just an act without any substance. These individuals are full of bravado and are dominating. They believe they have all the answers and are quick to cut off any discussion that veers in a direction that runs contrary to their opinions. They dismiss debate as being a complete waste of time. They always need to be right—which means proving everyone else wrong.
         </blockquote> 
         <b>Genuine Humility</b> is born of self-knowledge. Never forget where you started. “Genuine humility helps you recognize that you are neither better nor worse than anyone else, that you ought to respect everyone equally and not treat anyone differently just because of a job title.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/KraemerDiagram.jpg" width="175" height="175" align="right" alt="From Values to Action">After describing each of these principles, Kraemer explains how these four elements play in everyday situations such as 
         <b>talent management and leadership development</b> (“The values based leader is looking for people who exhibit the values that are most important to her.”), 
         <b>setting a clear direction</b> (You’ve been tasked with creating a quick strategy, the first step is to listen. “This is precisely the time that you need to draw upon the capabilities of the excellent team you’ve put together.”), 
         <b>communication</b> (“Never assume you have communicated enough.”), 
         <b>motivation</b> (“What you must do is relate to others by letting them know who you are and the values you stand for.”), and 
         <b>execution</b> (“As you become a leader, you will shift from knowing the right answers to asking the right questions.”). 
         <br>
         <br>Kraemer describes a values-based leader well: “
         <b>Self-reflection</b> increases his self-awareness. 
         <b>Balance</b> encourages him to seek out different perspectives from all team members and to change his mind when appropriate in order to make the best possible decisions. With 
         <b>true self-confidence</b>, he does not have to be right, and he easily shares credit with his team. 
         <b>Genuine humility</b> allows him to connect with everyone because no one is more important than anyone else.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780470881255.html" title="Harry Kraemer"><i>From Values to Action</i></a> is an 
         <b><i>outstanding</i></b> book and filled with important concepts that any would-be leader would benefit from.

         <h2 class="title">Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions</h2> 
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781591843795.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781591843795sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div>Guy Kawasaki has made a career out of enchanting people. He has summarized what he has learned so far in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781591843795.html"><i>Enchantment</i></a>. (Think 
         <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People 2011</i>.) Reading his book you will clearly see that enchantment doesn’t happen by accident. It is a state of mind that can be developed and perfected. 
         <br>
         <br>In a perfect world, if you had a better mousetrap, the world would beat a path to your door. Unfortunately it doesn’t work that way anymore. In our social media driven world you need to enchant them. 
         <br>
         <br>You need enchantment when you are trying to change the world because you need to convince people to dream the same dream you do, you need to overcome inertia and the fear of big changes, the process of getting people to diverge from a crowd is similar to getting them to join one, and you need people to engage for the long term. 
         <br>
         <br>The process of delighting (enchanting) people with a product, service, organization, or idea begins with three steps: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Likeability</b>. Guy knows likeability. (330,000+ Twitter followers can’t be wrong.) You need people to like you. The way to do that says Kawasaki is to accept others and find something to like in them. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Trust</b>. Like likeability, you go first. You trust others first and they will trust you. Kawasaki says there are 
         <b>two types of people in the world: bakers and eaters</b>. Eaters think zero-sum. They want the biggest slice of any pie. The bakers don’t see the world as zero-sum game. They want to make more and bigger pies. Bakers are more enchanting than eaters. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Get Ready</b>. Make your offering great. It should be DICEE—
         <b>Deep</b> (many features), 
         <b>Intelligent</b> (clever/innovative), 
         <b>Complete</b> (all aspects of the offering is a great experience), 
         <b>Empowering</b> (makes possible what you couldn’t do before), and 
         <b>Elegant</b> (works with you not against you). 
         <br>
         <br>As a part of getting ready he suggests you do a 
         <b><i>pre</i></b>-mortem. Before the launch, assume you failed and ask, “What might have gone wrong?” Come up with reasons why the failure occurred in order to prevent problems and increase the likelihood of success. 
         <br>
         <br>In two very practical chapters, Kawasaki talks about 
         <i>push</i> and 
         <i>pull</i> technology. “
         <i>Push</i> technology brings your story to people. 
         <i>Pull</i> technology brings people to your story.” Push technologies are presentations, e-mail and Twitter. Pull technologies are web sites, blogs, YouTube and Facebook. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781591843795.html"><i>Enchantment</i></a> is about becoming the kind of person people want to follow and it begins with approaching people thinking how you help them rather than wondering what they can do for you.

         </div>Building on the ideas he first presented in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781591843160.html"><i>Linchpin</i></a>, Seth Godin is back encouraging us to start things—start a project, make a ruckus, take what feels like a risk. 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781936719006.html"><i>Poke the Box</i></a> is about seeing what happens. 
         <br>
         <br>“The box,” writes Godin, “might be a computer or it might be a market or it might be a customer or it might be your boss. It’s a puzzle, one that can be solved in only one way—by poking. When you do this, what happens? When you do that, what happens? The box reveals itself through your poking.” 
         <br>
         <br>Godin says the opportunity is in creating unique learning experiences that are worth sharing. He advises that we start and keep staring until the project is finished. Failure is a part of starting anything worthwhile. “If you can’t fail, it doesn’t count.” 
         <br>
         <br>Here are a few more bits of Godin wisdom: 
         <blockquote>
          Look for the fear. That’s almost always the source of your doubt. 
          <br>
          <br>Reject the tyranny of picked. Pick yourself. 
          <br>
          <br>Sooner or later, many idealists transform themselves into disheartened realists who mistakenly believe that giving up is the same thing as being realistic. 
          <br>
          <br>Poking doesn’t mean right. It means action. Once we learn how to take initiative we see opportunities all around us.
         </blockquote> Godin notes, “I’ve had a lot of practice in poking the box, figuring out which ideas resonate, and then shipping them. The more you do it, the more it gets done and the less crazy you feel.” He also cautions, “Poke. But be smart about it.” 
         <i>Poke the Box</i> is an effective and convincing book, but more importantly, if applied, is transformational.

         </div>In the final part of this series, 
         <b>Marshall Goldsmith</b> explains the relevancy of reflection in today’s world. It has always been a vital ingredient to success, but it becomes critical in the age of the knowledge worker. 
         <b>Jeremy Hunter</b> teaches courses on 
         <i>The Practice of Self-Management</i> at The Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management. He emphasizes a focus on reflecting in real-time—in the present—in order to align both our intentions and behaviors so that we might bring about the results we seek.

I also believe that it is more challenging. 
         <br>
         <br>We live in the age of the knowledge worker. Peter Drucker defined knowledge workers as 'people who know more about what they are doing than their boss'. Knowledge workers need to think and reflect. They have to listen and learn. They cannot just 'do what they are told', since their managers know less than they do about what they are doing. 
         <br>
         <br>On the other hand, we live in a world of constant stimulus. Our minds are barraged by media of all forms. Cell phones, emails, text messages and personal computers have reduced our already-limited attention spans. 
         <br>
         <br>One of the great challenges for the knowledge worker of the future is finding the time to think - in a world that is screaming at you to act.

Where I think my work is a bit different is that I focus on what a leader is doing right now as it is happening––reflection and awareness in the moment. Most people's immediate action will very likely be an automatic non-conscious process that they're not aware of. Throw in a little stress and emotional reactivity and people find themselves doing and saying things that are destructive to themselves, others, and their goals without understanding why nor knowing what to do about it. 
         <br>
         <br>The big issue is that the retrospective analysis alone can’t necessarily change a person's immediate habits. Science tells us that 90% or more of the brain’s activity is automatic and non-conscious. However, we have a worldview that focuses largely on conscious processing, we think that having the answer makes change automatically happen. A friend might say, “You know, Ruth, when you’re confronted with a challenge from a superior, you react too strongly.” OK, now Ruth knows that. We assume that just because Ruth knows what she does, she will change it. But there’s a whole other process that has to happen to change the wired-in, non-conscious, automatic pattern. Ruth may be 100% aware of what she does but then the trigger happens and it plays out in the same way. And then it’s, “Oh no, I did it again.” 
         <br>
         <br>Change happens in the choices we make right now. So my interest is in, how you actually retrain the brain by interrupting that automatic habit and doing something differently. You may have to do it over and over again but at some point the rewiring function will happen. And that’s a function of interrupting that immediate non-conscious habit and doing something different. 
         <br>
         <br>I give people a model of this process from the triggering moment of contact to the final result. All along there are intervention points. Of course, the earlier you can intervene, the better. Not everyone can interrupt the process early on, but what I emphasize is that you just need to interrupt it somewhere. And the more practiced one gets at it, the earlier you can see what is happening. It’s really about becoming more conscious about what you are doing, why you are doing it, what result do you want and do these behaviors get you there, and if they don’t, what do you need to be doing instead? 
         <br>
         <br>You always start with the repeated unwanted result. What’s the thing that keeps happening that you don’t want? For example, Ruth might say, “I notice that whenever I’m confronted, I fight back too aggressively or I get too hostile.” So now she knows that about herself and that’s the reflective piece. Now, let’s tie that reflection to action. 
         <br>
         <br>The next step is to build awareness of when and how that habit plays out. For example, “I have this meeting with my boss and I know he’s upset about something. What is it I do that might push back too hard, that gets me in trouble?" And so in that moment she's bringing attention to all the things that happen automatically--what is she doing? What is she feeling in the body? Tension? Pressure? What emotions are arising? What are the stories in her head? Directing her attention to her internal experience creates the awareness of the non-conscious habit. She now has the opportunity to step outside all those automatic reactions and make a different, more conscious choice. We’re tying the process of reflection to immediate behavior. Again, change happens in the choices we make right now.

         <br> As people are increasingly “burned out” from the stress and uncertainty of the economic reset, it’s too simplistic to just return to basic vacation policies, doing little to introduce meaningful distinctions between home and work.

Sabbaticals lead to people stepping back to see their work and creativity through a different lens. Daniel Patrick Forrester, Consider

         <b>James Strock</b> talks about the importance of taking time “off” from one’s customary activities. He also gives insight into gaining perspective through reflection.

Indeed, it should be scheduled—and protected and enforced—with the utmost seriousness. 
         <br>
         <br>Religious traditions include notions of a Sabbath, a day of rest and reflection. It’s a recognition that taking time “off” from one’s customary activities is necessary to fulfill one’s obligations, to perform effectively over time. It’s also an act of humility, pulling people away from a prideful presumption of the significance of their personal contribution and control when it tends toward isolating, habitual overwork. 
         <br>
         <br>It’s surely not a coincidence that so many of the greatest leaders have been noted for multiple interests. Winston Churchill was active as a painter, speaker, historian, and commentator on current events. Theodore Roosevelt was, in the memorable description of Brander Matthews, “polygonal.” George Washington and Abraham Lincoln maintained perspective through theatre. Though it would be an error to say that effective leaders have “balanced” lives at any given moment, they tend to bring a number of interests to bear—thereby increasing their capacity to see things from various perspectives, and to discern and appreciate the contributions of others. 
         <br>
         <br>In business, one thinks of Bill Gates’ semi-annual, week-long sabbaticals for study and reflection. Many enterprises—from Google and GE to sports teams—encourage regular meditation or related mental exercises. To the extent each day can be seen as a sort of lifetime in itself, meditation or prayer can also be viewed as a sabbatical of sorts. 
         <br>
         <br>In my personal experience, travel can be invaluable. Simply being pulled out of one’s daily routines and habits, and being inspired by new surroundings, can be mentally and spiritually invigorating. You may see familiar notions with new eyes. 
         <br>
         <br>Though disciplined reflection has always been important for leadership, it’s arguably more important now than ever before. In the 21st century, information and data are often ubiquitous. The value added by leaders—either in high positions or not—increasingly arises from those invaluable intangibles: judgment and insight. Both of those are more likely to be found with disciplined reflection. And there’s no better place to start than from history and the observations and experiences of others, such as is offered so notably by LeadershipNow.

I think that sentiment applies to the good that can come out of reflection. 
         <br>
         <br>One of the reasons we don't learn—truly internalize lessons—and keep making similar mistakes is that we don't pause long enough to gain any insights. 
         <br>
         <br>Most of the busy and successful professionals I work with—and myself included—can go for long periods of time without actively thinking. We reactively think—response to questions, problems, opportunities, etc.—but don't make time to proactively think. 
         <br>
         <br>I frequently say that nobody 
         <i>has</i> time for anything; we make time for what is important. So often we live life be default and let circumstance and the demands of others determine how we spend out time. I believe we need to make time for reflection. We make time when we priorities, eliminate and adjust our schedules. 
         <br>
         <br>Specifically, I think leaders should reflect on: 
         <ol>
          <li> What they are accomplishing versus how busy they are.</li> 
          <li>What they have learned. Leaders need to extract lessons from both the positive and negative things that happen.</li> 
          <li>How they are feeling. Leaders can't divorce their intellect from their emotions and succeed over the long run.</li> 
          <li>Relationships that need attention.</li> 
          <li>Their vision of the future, for their organizations, those they lead and themselves.</li> 
          <li>And for leaders who believe in the spiritual realm, as I do, that is a critical area for reflection (prayer and meditation in the Christian tradition I follow).</li>
         </ol> Reflection usually requires "getting away" whether that requires a physical relocation to a peaceful thinking spot or simply blocking time to avoid interruptions. 
         <br>
         <br>And finally, I think those leaders who value reflection and benefit most from it make it a regular part of their schedules. 
         <br>

         <br> There is a hierarchy of communication we all practice, in which electronic and immediate data responses reign far above in-person and more time-intensive, dialogue-driven interaction. The trade-off is easy to make: we gain speed, immediate connection, and reactions while giving up richer contexts that emerge only when we take time to think. There are times when the arrival of each new electronic message or data-driven distraction has become a digital proxy for the sound of a bell once used by a doctor named Pavlov.

I’ve been spending more time reflecting on my work than passionately involved in the doing of it. To an outsider, it may look like idleness. In fact, history informs me that it’s a necessary prelude to meaningful change, to boldness and growth. 
         <br>
         <br>Our work should be designed to move us forward, toward a worthy ideal, meaning, and a better life. But in order to get there, we must occasionally pause from its narcotic effect and critically evaluate its impact on our happiness and well-being, and its resulting influence on our community and environment. We must sit quietly and reflect. 
         <br>
         <br>Reflection is not daydreaming. Reflection is imaginative inquiry; it’s an internal dialogue that asks, Am I making a difference? Is this the best that I can do? Will people be advanced by my efforts? Will my children be proud of my actions? Yes, there is boldness in action. But we must follow action with quiet reflection for that boldness to remain relevant and vibrant. 
         <br>
         <br>Elbert Hubbard wrote, “The reason men oppose progress is not that they hate progress, but that they love inertia.” Reflection is the path to progress. Imaginative reflection breaks the powerful grasp of inertia—the desire to stay the course regardless of the impact on our lives—and moves us courageously towards our higher potential.

         <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jul/15/slow-reading" title="The art of slow reading" target="_blank"><i>Guardian</i></a> summarizes for me, where we are at: “Although, because of the Internet, we have become very good at collecting a wide range of factual tidbits, we are also gradually forgetting how to sit back, contemplate, and relate all these facts to each other. And so, as Carr writes, "we're losing our ability to strike a balance between those two very different states of mind. Mentally, we're in perpetual locomotion". 
         <br>
         <br>From my experience as a minister, I have found that an issue is rarely understood well by the first exposure to it. Our first response is usually weighted by whoever presented the issue. It takes time and thought to slowly come to a more complete understanding. The value of reflection in this case allows for a deeper understanding to be obtained by thinking about the issue and allowing it to be seen from a number of angles. 
         <br>
         <br>There are two biblical principles that to me, support reflection. First, Proverbs 18:17 states, “The one who states his case first seems right, until the other comes and examines him.” We all have the tendency to accept the first version of what we hear, but the concept of “searching” carries the idea of talking and asking questions, but also thinking about the situation and the reconsidering of fundamental assumptions. 
         <br>
         <br>The second is simply the whole idea of seeking counsel. This must mean a certain amount of reflection and counsel has a strong bearing on decision making.

         <br> Devaluing reflection while expecting constant growth and innovation is nonsensical. It’s only when we step away from the onslaught of the day that a new direction arises (good or bad). By never stepping away and, instead, insisting on constant connectivity, you can’t be sure if what you are working on will prove you to be relevant in the future.

         <b>John Kotter</b> begins this series on reflection by talking about the need to develop a reflective habit and why we don’t. Are we spending our time on the right issues? Are we delegating issues we should not be working on that could be better dealt with more locally in the organization? Kotter also stresses its importance as a continual learning tool. 
         <b>John Baldoni</b> urges us to make the time to reflect to gain perspective. He reframes reflection as an action step, not a passive process.

Doing what you know is not enough. And learning cannot come in a classroom once every 2 years. That’s too little too late. Learning has to be an ongoing process, literally all the time. 
         <br>
         <br>People learn in many ways. Reading really good books can help. Talking to really good people can help. Nothing wrong with going to a Harvard executive education program, but there is no better teacher than reflection on the world, and especially one’s own actions. I did X. It produced Z. But is Z what we really need? And why did X create Z? And what were the other alternatives? And can I find others (in books, discussions, HBS) that tried those other alternatives? 
         <br>
         <br>Obviously, self awareness makes this easier. If I pay no attention to what I am really doing, what it is really producing, it’s hard to reflect on that. 
         <br>
         <br>One can be both action oriented 
         <i>and</i> reflective. Action oriented means when you know what to do and you do it. Now. Not next quarter. Let’s go. Reflection means using the time on airplanes, when you’re not on the slopes or with family at the ski lodge, Zenning-out on the beach—whatever—to think. 
         <br>
         <br>People don’t reflect because they have no time, but usually because they don’t delegate enough, let others delegate up to them, or don’t have the staff they can delegate to—all correctable problems. People don’t reflect because they haven’t—so they have no reflective habit, so to speak. Correctable too. 
         <br>
         <br>Since the end game is life, not one’s job, all this is not only 
         <i>applicable</i> to life in general but is arguably more 
         <i>important</i> for life in general. 
         <br>
         <br>And since leaders have the capacity to help or hurt us all a great deal, everything I have said here is very important in their case.

The chief reason is perceived lack of time. I remember asking the late Skip LeFauvre, the man who ran Saturn, how he found time for it. He said, "Put it on your schedule." 
         <br>
         <br>Reflection is a means of gaining perspective. It challenges you to think where you are now and where you might want to go. How to get there is a good thing to consider during reflection. 
         <br>
         <br>Reflection may be perceived as a passive process, i.e. sit and ponder. In reality, reflection is an action step. You are thinking. That can be rigorous in its methodology. Reflection can also come through the writing process, i.e. organizing and expressing thoughts on a problem and its solution. Thinking of reflection as an active process makes it more palatable to leaders who by nature are doers; they like to be engaged in activities. Reflection can be one of them.

         <br> Constant change doesn’t lend itself to instantaneous insights through simple phrases like “too big to fail,” and “liquidity crisis.” The question we must ask ourselves is this: In the midst of dramatic and extreme change, has decision making devolved into merely informed chaos, or can we imbed reflection and think time into our habits and routines to arrive at better outcomes and understanding?

         <br>While reflection seems to have no place in a competitive business environment, it is where meaning is created, behaviors are regulated, values are refined, assumptions are challenged, intuition is accessed, and where we learn about who we are. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Some of the greatest barriers to getting the results we want lie within us.</b> Growth happens when we stop repeating our habitual patterns and behaviors and begin to see things in a new way and in the process, discover the power to create the results we want. That makes

         </div> Author Daniel Patrick Forrester states, “
         <b>Stepping away from the problem—and structuring time to think and reflect—just may prove the most powerful differentiator that allows your organization to remain relevant and survive</b>…. The best decisions, insights, ideas, and outcomes result when we take sufficient time to think and reflect….Only by carving out think time and reflection can we actually understand, in an entirely different context, the actions we take.” 
         <br>
         <br>He defines 
         <b>think time</b> as “the purposeful elevation of chunks of our work time, forged within densely packed schedules. It forces the consideration of core significant and pending decisions, outside of cursory overviews and immediate response…. 
         <b>Reflection</b> is the deliberate act of stepping back from daily habits and routines (without looming and immediate deadline pressures), either alone or within small and sequestered groups. It’s where meaning is derived through reconsideration of fundamental assumptions, the efficacy of past decisions and the consequences including the downside of future actions. It’s where space is given for the ‘totally unexpected’ to emerge.” 
         <br>
         <br>Even if we can agree on the value of think time, we still regard it as a luxury. There’s just no time. But what emerges from Forrester’s research is the fact that we can’t afford not to. It is at the core of what allows a business to thrive. It’s what we don’t know that has a disproportionate impact on us personally and organizationally. We don’t really see the reality we face. 
         <b>Reflection in effect, expands our perspectives and thus reveals to us more options and that gets to the heart of what leadership is all about.</b> The point is to make the unseen seen so we can act on it. 
         <br>
         <br>Forrester interviewed Sarah Sewall who worked with General Petraeus and others to rewrite the military’s counterinsurgency doctrine. Sewall noted, “We are now in a world of increasing specialization, where people get narrower and narrower in their viewpoints in order to become more expert and ‘useful.’ My view is that people become more myopic in how they can think about problems and solutions. 
         <b>We wind up shuttered in our ability to think about possibilities.</b>” This tendency is best counteracted by think time and reflection; being able to back away and incorporate more and varied thinking. 
         <br>
         <br>Forrester asks, “What is the last document or strategy you can point to as a ‘product of reflection’ built with all parts of the organization and senior-level involvement? If you can’t cite one, it may indicate a culture that values immediacy and the short term over reflection and scalable problem solving.” 
         <br>
         <br>Recognizing the need for reflection and actually doing it are two different things. Reflection is a discipline. General Petraeus told Forrester that “
         <b>he forces bursts of reflection into his day</b>, where he pauses to read, think, and then moves to the next iteration—recognizing that thoughtful insights are not born through real-time analysis.” 
         <br>
         <br>Forrester suggests that we set time aside for a meeting with oneself. “It isn’t hard to 
         <b>book a meeting with yourself</b>, when you are off-limits to everything but your thoughts.” He notes too, “The power of reflection lies not in how much time we allocate to it. The power of reflection lies in how we choose to use that time and what structure we bring to the fleeting disjointed moments we are afforded.” 
         <br>
         <br>While some situations required his immediate action, Forrester describes how Lincoln “developed ways to force time to think (if even only for a few minutes) before acting. Even Lincoln had to resist the “instantaneous nature of the telegraph.” 
         <br>
         <br>Some organizations he has studied have adopted a no internal e-mail Friday policy and other ways to temporarily disconnect from technology. Although these ideas may not work for you, the point is made so that you might consider the impact these technologies are having on the productivity and well-being of your staff. There is always one more e-mail and it will control you if you let it. 
         <br>
         <br>“When overworked people declare that they ‘just don’t have time to think,’ leaders have a choice: They settle for the status quo and declare that it’s the best way the world works today, or they can insist that reflection is a strategic business enabler,” says Forrester. As an organization you can either educate for it, make it an expectation—a cultural norm—or treat it as a “do it on your own time” activity and pay the price. Leaders need to understand and demonstrate by example that reflection—taking time to consider—is not wasted time. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Reflection is the first step in coming to understand how we are connected to our outcomes.</b> Until we see the relationship between the two, we cannot make deep, lasting change and bring thoughtful behaviors to bear on the situations we find ourselves in. Our thinking creates our reality. If we do not reflect on our thinking we stand to miss our connection to the whole. 
         <br>

It helps to disrupt the habitual thinking that drowns out the reflective, critical thinking we need to become fully present and effective. Consider isn’t a fad. It is the bedrock of successful leadership and living.

         <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470411570?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=leadershipnow-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0470411570"><i>Shaking the Globe</i></a>. That kind of leadership requires courage. 
         <br>
         <br>McGarvie describes courage as a firmness of mind and will in the face of danger or extreme difficulty.” A courageous leader understands “that it takes personal risk or sacrifice to make a difference.” McGarvie offers four building blocks of courage to encourage you to boost your courageousness: 
         <ol>
          <li><b>Competence.</b> Do you set the bar for your accomplishments high and find ways to tackle them realistically? The key to building a reputation for competence is to do what you say you’re going to do—while building new capabilities for your organization in the process.</li> 
          <li><b>Curiosity.</b> Amar Bose once said, “I never went into business to make money. I went into business so that I could do interesting things that hadn’t been done before.” What drives the kinds of projects or responsibilities for which you strive? Are you receptive to new ideas, both your own and those originating from your colleagues? As you develop your listening and analytical skills and pursue your curiosity, you will be amazed at the new opportunities to be tapped.</li> 
          <li><b>Caring.</b> Starbucks founder Howard Schultz said he “wanted to build the kind of company that my father never got the chance to work for, in which people were respected.” Schultz wants to have his employees care as much about the business as he does. He willingly takes the blame for bad ideas to create a safe environment for his employees to be creative.</li> 
          <li><b>Perseverance.</b> Sometimes courage means having the drive to take on even the most daunting of tasks: admitting that we are wrong once in a while. But, courage also means not giving up in the face of high hurdles. Next time you’re faced with an obstacle—whether that might be a sand trap or an unhappy board—square up and be prepared to give it your best shot.</li>

         </div>Considering the pressure on us today, Laura Stack says it’s not enough to be 
         <i>only</i> competent, we need to be super-competent. By that she means that SuperCompetent people “possess a consistent, all-encompassing ability to be good at everything they do, no matter how general or specific.” While that definition may sound super-human (wouldn’t it be nice to be perfect), the thinking behind it is solid and attainable. 
         <br>
         <br>You have to decide to be good at what you do. Once you have made the decision to do so, 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780470599150.html"><i>SuperCompetent</i></a> by productivity expert Laura Stack, provides the method. She has isolated six interconnected traits or mindsets that make up the SuperCompetent person: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Key 1: Activity.</b> They are driven by intense focus on priorities and have a clear sense of direction. 
         <br>
         <i>Action: You need to determine what you should be working on.</i> 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Key 2: Availability.</b> They control their schedules. 
         <br>
         <i>Action: You need to make time for it.</i> 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Key 3: Attention.</b> They develop the ability to pay attention to the task at hand. 
         <br>
         <i>Action: You need to focus on those tasks.</i> 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Key 4: Accessibility.</b> They are organized and can locate the information they need to support their activities. 
         <br>
         <i>Action: You need to organize the information you need to complete your tasks.</i> 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Key 5: Accountability.</b> They are self-disciplined and don’t blame others. 
         <br>
         <i>Action: You need to be responsible for your results.</i> 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Key 6: Attitude.</b> They do what needs to be done to make things happen. They are proactive decisive and fast. 
         <br>
         <i>Action: You never give up.</i> 
         <br>
         <br>“Each key requires close attention to and a profound understanding of your own strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities in all areas to truly excel.” Stack begins with a short 
         <i>SuperCompetent Assessment</i> to give you an idea of the areas you need to focus on. From there, she provides so much content that even the most competent among us would find something to think about. She provides simple approaches to help you improve in each of the six areas. Some are so simple that you may ask yourself, “Why am I not doing that?” (See the section on accountability.) 
         <br>
         <br>A friend told her, “Oh, it didn’t bother me. I had a mission, not an agenda.” “So often when launching a new endeavor,” writes Stack, “we get caught up in the agenda of the day—or worse—someone else’s agenda for us. We lose sight of our purpose.” Don’t get distracted by the details. 
         <br>
         <br>Then there is the problem of the ever-growing To-Do List. She list ten issues at the heart of the problem like: You haven’t made the necessary decisions. Your list should be full of clear, actionable ideas. “If you set a vague goal—like ‘Have a sale’—then you’ve still got a lot of thinking to do before you can hit the ground running and make progress.” If it isn’t actionable, it shouldn’t be on the list. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780470599150.html"><i>SuperCompetent</i></a> provides the motivation to rethink your habits and your approach to anything you do; to live and work more responsibly. An sometimes all we need is a little push. Stack writes, “To be consistently successful, you need to be consistently productive.” I find that productivity ultimately comes down to self-discipline. And when you are successful at it, it serves to reinforce the behavior. Better performance promotes our feelings of competence and the enjoyment of our tasks. Productivity equals morale.

         <br>
         <br>Make sure that the first person you are managing every day is yourself. Take good care of yourself outside of work so that you can bring your best self to work every day. Arrive a little early to work and stay a little late. Focus on playing the role assigned to you before trying to reach beyond that role. Focus on doing your tasks, responsibilities, and projects very well, very fast, all day long. If you want to carry weight with your boss, that should be your primary focus. Be a problem-solver, not a complainer. Commit to continuous improvement through rigorous self-evaluation. 
         <br>
         <br>Think about context and figure out where you fit in every situation. Continually ask yourself, “Where do I fit in this picture? Why am I here? What is at stake for me? What is my appropriate role in relation to the other people in the group? What is my appropriate role in relation to the mission?” Concentrate on playing these roles 110 percent. Contribute your very best thoughts, words, and actions. No matter how lowly or mundane or repetitive or minor your tasks and responsibilities might seem in relation to the overall mission, play your role to the max. Attitude matters—a lot. Effort matters—a lot. 
         <br>
         <br>Start mastering the art of human relations. Approach every relationship by focusing on what you have to offer the other person rather than on what you might want or need. Be a model of trust. Remove your ego. Listen carefully. Empathize. Exhibit respect and kindness. Speak up and make yourself understood. Be a motivator. Celebrate the success of others. 
         <br>
         <br>Make yourself a great workplace citizen. Under-promise and over-deliver. Don’t bad mouth others, and try not to speak about others unless they are present. Keep your word. Keep your confidences. Be an accurate source of information. Don’t keep other people waiting. Instead of under-dressing, overdress. Practice old-fashioned good manners..

          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780061789083.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9780061789083sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Power"></a>
         </div>In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780061789083.html"><i>Power</i></a>, Jeffrey Pfeffer states that you can “compete and even triumph in organizations of all types, large and small, public or private sector, if you understand the principles of power and are willing to use them.” 
         <br>
         <br>For some, power is a bad word. But, without a doubt, power does open doors and provides opportunity. Powerlessness creates its own problems—pettiness, blame, irresponsibility, hopelessness and depression. 
         <br>
         <br>Pfeffer takes a candid look at power. He has found that those that have obtained power possess not only the 
         <b><i>will</i></b>—the drive to take on big challenges—but also the 
         <b><i>skill</i></b>—the capabilities required to turn ambition into accomplishment. As part of these two fundamental personal attributes, they also possess seven essential personal qualities that help them amass organizational power and influence: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b><i>Will: The drive to take on big challenges</i></b> 
         <blockquote> 
          <b>1. Ambition</b> &nbsp; “Organizational life can be irritating and frustrating and can divert people’s effort and attention. Ambition—a focus on achieving influence—can help people overcome the temptation to give up or to give in to the organization.” 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Energy</b> &nbsp; Energy does three things: inspires more effort on the part of others, the long hours it permits provide an advantage in getting things accomplished, and people with energy often get promoted because hard work equates with organizational commitment and loyalty. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Focus</b> &nbsp; “Focus turns out to be surprisingly rare. People are often unwilling or unable to commit themselves to a specific company, industry, or job function. Particularly talented people often have many interests and many opportunities and can’t choose among them.”
         </blockquote> 
         <br>
         <b><i>Skill: The capabilities required to turn ambition into accomplishment</i></b>
         <br> 
         <blockquote> 
          <b>4. Self-Knowledge</b> &nbsp; When he asked one executive what leadership habits made him effective, he answered, “Making notes about decisions, meetings, and other interactions and reflecting on what he had done well or poorly so that he could improve his skills.” 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>5. Confidence</b> &nbsp; “Observers will associate confident behavior with actually having power. Coming across as confident and knowledgeable helps you build confidence.” 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>6. Empathy with Others</b> &nbsp; “Putting yourself in the other’s place is one of the best ways to advance your own agenda.” 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>7. Capacity to Tolerate Conflict</b> &nbsp; “Because most people are conflict-adverse, they avoid difficult situations and difficult people, frequently acceding to requests or changing their positions rather than paying the emotional price of standing up for themselves and their views. If you handle difficult conflict- and stress-filled situations effectively, you have an advantage over most people.”
         </blockquote> Power has a right use and a wrong use. 
         <b>The time to think about power is before you get it.</b> Seneca’s caution that those with great power should use it lightly goes in one ear and out the other if you haven’t first established your personal view of and relationship with power. 
         <br>
         <br>Nearly everything Pfeffer writes in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780061789083.html"><i>Power</i></a> can be taken the wrong way and applied in ways that will eventually cost you power or even derail you. Then, too, it can be applied in constructive and other-focused ways as well. If you execute these power strategies at the expense of others, you’re sowing the seeds of your own destruction. If wisdom isn’t part of your agenda, you will end up where you never intended. Unfortunately, there is very little in modern life that will serve to guide you in meaningful ways. 
         <br>
         <br>History is littered with lessons from those who have used power to advance selfish agendas. However, if you use it with humility, if you use it to free others to lead, you can build a lasting legacy. 
         <b>Humility resolves the problems posed by power.</b> 
         <i>How</i> you build it is as important as 
         <i>why</i> you are building it.

         <br>Thanks-giving contributes to the human spirit and it can be shown in many unique ways. Ideas for thanks-giving in the workplace, the classroom and at home: 
         <br>
         <br>Demonstrate your thankfulness by how you treat everyone you meet. 
         <br>Don’t let others feel small or stupid around you. Let them be smarter. 
         <br>Be generous with your praise and stingy with your criticism. 
         <br>Don’t give the answer. Show them how to find it. 
         <br>Help others find the strength in their weakness. 
         <br>Be civil. It shows others you appreciate them. 
         <br>Encourage others and applaud their efforts. 
         <br>Give others the room to grow. 
         <br>Complement the competition. 
         <br>Give your best self to others. 
         <br>Help others triumph. 
         <br>Share the good stuff. 
         <br>Walk your talk. 
         <br>Laugh. 
         <br>Listen. 
         <br>
         <br>Say Thanks.

         </div>Charisma is often thought to be something in your DNA. You either have it or you don’t. But as Kurt Mortensen makes clear in 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780814415917.html" title="Laws of Charisma"><i>The Laws of Charisma</i></a>, it “is a trait that can be taught and mastered.” 
         <br>
         <br>Charisma is about connecting with others. Mortensen defines it as “the ability to easily build rapport, effectively influence others to your way of thinking, inspire them to achieve more, and in the process make an ally for life.” Like leadership, it can be used positively or negatively. It depends on where the emphasis is: self or others. For example he lists some of the differences between ethical and unethical uses of charisma:

         <br>Ultimately, charisma will only take you so far. Without character and competence, it is fleeting. 
         <br>
         <br>Our greatest roadblock to developing charisma, Mortensen points out, is that we lie to ourselves. We think we are better than we are. We think our weaknesses aren’t that noticeable and it gives us a false sense of security and no starting place from which to begin to make the improvements we need to make. 
         <br>
         <br>Mortensen has created a 
         <b>self-assessment for 30 attributes</b> that define a charismatic individual. Chapter by chapter, he takes you through each of these describing them, showing how they are applied with real world examples and what the 
         <b>counterfeit version</b> of each looks like. For instance, passion is not hype or bouncing off the walls. It’s more like conviction that radiates from within. You may think you’re coming across as confident, but you could be perceived as either arrogant, cocky, or condescending. Arrogance is about self and confidence is about others. Control is not power. It creates short-term compliance even as it drains the life out of people and creates long-term resentment. 
         <br>
         <br>The attributes are organized into four areas: 
         <br>
         <br>The 
         <b>elements of presence</b>—how to radiate charisma through 
         <i>passion, confidence, congruence, optimism, positive power, energy and balance</i>, and 
         <i>humor and happiness</i>. 
         <br>
         <br>Tapping into and developing the 
         <b>core inner qualities of charisma</b>: 
         <i>self-discipline, competence, intuition, purpose, integrity, courage, creativity</i>, and 
         <i>focus</i>. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Delivery and communication</b>—how to use 
         <i>presentation skills, people skills, influence, storytelling, eye contact, listening</i>, and 
         <i>rapport</i> to speak with conviction and get heard. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Empowering others</b> through 
         <i>inspiration, esteem, credibility, motivation, goodwill, vision, empathy</i>, and 
         <i>respect</i>—the components of contagious cooperation. 
         <br>
         <br>Other things to consider are how you communicate (both verbally and non-verbally), how you look, and your feelings and moods. 
         <br>
         <br>Each chapter is well thought out as he looks at each attribute from different angles. Each attribute is just a piece of the total charisma picture. The more you develop, the better you will be able to connect with others. While some of these attributes will come naturally to you, some will take a concerted effort. Taken as a whole, these thirty attributes are overwhelming. Take them one at a time. It’s a lifelong process.

         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780814415917.html" title="Laws of Charisma"><i>The Laws of Charisma</i></a>, Kurt Mortensen lists a number of things we do that repel people. He writes, “These mistakes are silent charisma killers. Most people will never say anything to you that will alert you to the fact that they are being repelled. They are more comfortable lying to you so that they don’t hurt your feelings. They walk away and simply never deal with you again.” Here are seven of the most common charisma killers adapted from Mortensen’s list that you may not even know you are doing: 
         <ol>
          <li><b>Talking Too Much.</b> How can you influence others if you are always talking?</li> 
          <li><b>Showing How Much You Know.</b> You can come across as forceful, aggressive, and obnoxious.</li> 
          <li><b>Getting To Friendly Too Fast.</b> Research tells us that the majority of people do not appreciate unsolicited small talk, and many find it offensive.</li> 
          <li><b>Getting Too Comfortable (Too Fast).</b> Respect their things and they will respect you.</li> 
          <li><b>Proxemics.</b> You must respect personal space, or you will make others feel uncomfortable.</li> 
          <li><b>Being One-Sided With Your Facts.</b> There are facts and there is the truth. Are you genuine and transparent?</li> 
          <li><b>Arguing or Trying to Prove You Are Right.</b> Having to be right demonstrates an arrogance that is masking insecurity.</li>
         </ol> Are you guilty of any of these?

         <h2 class="title">Do You Have Leadership Lock-in?</h2> As individuals, 
         <b>familiarity breeds <i>cognitive lock-in</i>.</b> We experience cognitive lock-in whenever we choose to do something out of habit even when objectively better alternatives exist. We behave 
         <i>automatically</i> rather than 
         <i>intentionally</i>. 
         <br>
         <br>This impacts us as leaders too. It develops a kind of 
         <b><i>leadership lock-in</i></b>. We get so locked-in to the values, beliefs, behavioral norms, habits and routines that it is hard to lead intentionally—the way we know we should—the way we want to. We just go through the motions of leadership without really thinking about what we are doing or the long-term consequences of our actions. Instead of adapting and learning, we plow ahead with behaviors that we are comfortable with. 
         <br>
         <br>The more we behave or think in a certain way, the less likely it is that we will do anything to change it, even when we can see that it is not serving us well. Instead of “learning” from experience, we really only “see” from experience the effects of our behavior. Learning is an action step. But leadership lock-in contributes to our desire to avoid the effort needed to change our behavior in a way that would get us the results we truly seek. To escape the old, locked-in behaviors, we must consciously practice what we have learned until it reaches a critical mass—until feedback reinforces/rewards that new behavior—and it becomes self-sustaining. 
         <br>
         <br>The comforting feel of immediate gratification plays into much of the problem presented by leadership lock-in. For example, self-serving behaviors, emotional outbursts, expediency, unrealistic pacing, and control issues, all give us immediate—momentary—gratification, but in the end, masks the long-term consequences of such behavior and thinking. And we get locked-in to what we think is working or more likely, is only working for us. 
         <br>
         <br>Leadership lock-in is at odds with sustainable leadership. That’s why it has been estimated that well over half of leaders don’t finish well. They get tripped up by their own thinking. The cumulative impact of their behavior derails them and eventually neutralizes their influence. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Escaping leadership lock-in</b> begins with asking yourself, “Do I believe in this approach? Is this how I would want to be treated? Is what I am saying or doing expressing the values I believe in?”

         <b>an adventure is merely a bit of bad planning, brought to light by the test of a trial</b>… . Serious work in exploration calls for as definite and rigorous professional preparation as does success in any other serious work in life.” 
         <br>
         <br>Adventure or drama, as it is used here, indicates a lack of “definite and rigorous professional preparation.” You manage uncertain times with preparation. Survival in uncertain times is made more likely by developing oneself. Grow both the breadth and depth of your thinking. Build your portfolio of experience. Build your knowledge for adaptability. Build your connections for exposure and to reveal possibilities. 
         <br>
         <br>Tom Hopkins states the idea well in

Being well trained will help you be one of those people who thrives not just now but when things turn back around, as they always do. Don’t rely on your company to train you, either.” 
         <br>
         <br>Tom Peters wrote today on 
         <i>Twitter</i>, 
         <b>“I think there is an incredible and widespread failure to take responsibility for oneself.</b>” How well you learn, how well you prepare to respond to what comes your way, will determine your “luck.” In the end, it’s all up to you.

As high as 40% of new executives fail within the first eighteen months of being named to their positions. 
         <br>
         <br>New positions carry with them greater expectations even if those expectations are not clearly stated. You are left to navigate uncharted territory. The single most important thing to remember is that 
         <b>what got you there may not serve you well in your new position</b>. Going to the next level says Eblin, is “about developing consciousness around what is and isn’t serving you as you take those steps. It’s about retaining what is working, staying open to picking up new skills and mind-sets, and having the courage to let go of the behaviors and beliefs that brought you this far when they no longer serve you on your journey.” 
         <br>
         <br>Eblin has developed an 
         <b><i>Executive Presence</i> model</b> that focuses on nine behaviors in three areas that a successful executive should develop on the one hand and drop on the other:

         <br>
         <br>Eblin covers each of these behaviors in detail with insights, interviews, coaching tips and research. But in an important foundational chapter, he talks about 
         <b><i>grounded confidence</i></b>. That is, add value but know what you are talking about. “It is critical for your success that you not dwell on thoughts and self-assessments that cause you to doubt your capacity to contribute. 
         <br>
         <br>There is a certain amount of insecurity that comes with any new position, but “
         <b>insecure people make lousy leaders</b>.” Insecurity causes us to behave in a lot of counterproductive ways: indecisiveness, micromanaging and control, taking undeserved credit and passing blame, lack of teachability. 
         <br>
         <br>Eblin says that developing strong relationships with your peers is essential to your success. “Your success in managing relationships will stem from the confidence you have in yourself and your ability to work well with others to make things happen.” This is an area where you need to move quickly. 
         <br>
         <br>Your new role brings with it an expectation of your involvement in a wider range of issues. This means projecting confidence in your judgment that “extends beyond functional or technical knowledge.” This means also, more listening and less talking. Being teachable. Getting feedback. 
         <br>
         <br>Of course, there is a lot of confidence to be gained by being prepared—being intentional. Eblin’s approach is to begin with the end in mind. You need to consistently ask yourself two questions: “What do I want to accomplish?” “How do I need to show up to accomplish that?” 
         <br>
         <br>Practicing new and unfamiliar behaviors can be uncomfortable and seem artificial, but executed repeatedly these behaviors will become ingrained into your character and make them your own. As Aristotle said, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Feedback Tip:</b> Ask your colleagues this question—
         <i>What’s your best advice for anyone who is working on team reliance versus self-reliance (or whatever your working on)?</i> Experience shows that it’s useful to ask the question in this format instead of asking, for example—
         <i>What should I do to be better at team reliance?</i> Asking the question in a less personal way makes it easier for your colleagues to be candid in their feedback.

         </div>You can't control the change swirling around you but you can control how you experience it. Harvey Mackay offers this advice on getting the job you want: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>• Be prepared</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Regardless of the economy, there is nowhere you can hide that's guaranteed earthquake-proof against your own personal recession. The day can come when you step into your boss's or banker's office some Friday afternoon and hear, "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but..." It's not going to be easy, no matter how well prepared you are. But it's going to be a lot harder if you're like the 90 percent of us who aren't prepared when the bomb falls. And it can happen to anyone, anytime. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>• If you reach for the stars, at least you'll get off the ground</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Most important of all, you will survive. Trends have occurred that make some aspects of the economic situation better, not worse for employees and job seekers. Here are a few: 
         <ol>
          <li>There used to be a little piece of folk wisdom: "The good people are all working." It's not true anymore. There have been just too many layoffs of too many good people in recent years. There's no longer any stigma attached to being laid off. It's a fact of business life today.</li> 
          <li>Age is not the disadvantage it once was to employment. The era of the linear career... school, work, retire at sixty-five, die at sixty-eight...is over. As corporations rush to shed their high-salaried employees, you're probably going to be out of work much sooner than sixty-five. Yet paradoxically, past sixty-five, you're also much more likely to find work in some form for as long as you want it.</li> 
          <li>Changing values and expectations can erase the pain. In other societies, professions like the clergy, teaching, and social work are valued far more highly than in America. Yet, for a lot of us living in the most materialistic society on earth, success in material terms hasn't produced personal satisfaction. Who says you have to live by any values other than your own? If the personal freedom America affords has taught us anything, it's that you have only yourself to answer to for doing what you believe in and picking the life you choose.</li>
         </ol>

          In an environment filled with noise, actions speak louder than words, Instead of staking out a fixed position on the organizational chart, you need skills in designing and participating on ad hoc teams. And you need a certain kind of leadership and followership, to succeed. You live and work in a different world. You need new thinking and skills to succeed.

         </div>Managing ourselves is our biggest task as a leader. How well we manage ourselves determines the kind of leader we will be and the impact we will have. 
         <br>
         <br>Adapting Jonathan Haidt’s metaphor of the rider and the elephant, Richard Daft presents the executive (the voice of reason) and the elephant (impulsive and emotional) metaphor to help us to learn how to help our inner executive manage our inner elephant as needed to behave according to our best intentions—to better manage oneself. 
         <br>
         <br>One of the biggest problems we face as a result of our inner elephant’s tendency to distort reality. It’s one of the reasons we are so surprised when someone disagrees with us. Our internal elephant judges (our self and others), creates illusions (self-justification) and acts as our attorney (defends us and making us immune to reality). 
         <br>
         <br>In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780470372265.html"><i>The Executive and the Elephant</i></a>, Daft points out that our inner judge “sees things from a selfish point of view and has little empathy and consideration toward others. It is hard to be optimistic and motivate people when your mind is critical of them.” The judge will also become our own worst critic—“the automatic voice of blame and criticism inside your head that points out how inadequate you are.” Daft poignantly asks: “
         <b>Can you be an effective leader when your mind is constantly finding fault with you?</b>” 
         <br>
         <br>Daft illuminates some perceptual habits of the inner elephant that can get in the way of seeing the world accurately. Without a conscious effort to do otherwise, it is easy to fall prey to any or all of these six mental mistakes: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Reacting Too Quickly</b>. As quickly as things are thrown at us, it’s a lot easier being reactive than being proactive. It’s easy to instantly judge, conclude and react based on small scraps of data rather than slowing down and remaining calm says Daft. Serious intention is required to slow things down. How we see things always appears so clear to us and it seems we can’t act on it soon enough. It’s what the elephant does. We have to engage our inner executive to avoid acting on wrong-headed conclusions. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Inflexible Thinking</b>. The inner elephant doesn’t like to change its mind. After all, we believe what we think for obvious (to us) reasons. We don’t intentionally think the wrong thing. And we interpret the world around us according to our beliefs. “It is very hard to let go of your own gut feelings and mental preferences” says Daft. “It’s all you know. The mind-set, habits, and skills that made you successful tell you to stick to your guns. However, things change, and if the mind does not accept the current reality, it can create problems for everyone.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Wanting Control</b>. Your inner elephant is more comfortable when you’re in control. Of course, we only take control because if we didn’t things wouldn’t get done the way we think they should be done. But our satisfaction is at their expense. The desire for control can lead us to illusions—attempts to gain control (and think we have it) over the uncontrollable. A leader’s inner executive needs to learn to give control to others. Our job is to “engage a bigger picture of mission and purpose (inner executive) and let people be in control of their own work.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Emotional Avoidance and Attraction</b>. Even when we know we need to do something, our inner elephant can find reasons to avoid it. We procrastinate. We delay an intended course of action despite expecting to be worse off for the delay. Our inner elephant feels anxiety and creates an invisible barrier in our mind that prevents us from moving forward. Attraction can cause us problems by enslaving us to our desires. Desire for acceptance can cause to make decisions we wouldn’t otherwise make under the influence of our inner executive. About the desire for 
         <b>perfection</b>, Daft writes: 
         <blockquote>
          A few of my MBA students are perfectionists who can’t restrain their desire to redo a group project to make it look the way they want, even after I explain that 
          <b>this behavior is fatal for leaders who have to accomplish work through others</b>. Managers may also feel the need to act on their unthinking desire to be right rather than let other people shine, to perpetually find fault with other people’s ideas, to win every disagreement, to blame others when something goes wrong despite being culpable, or to speak harshly when upset.
         </blockquote> 
         <b>Exaggerating the Future</b>. Related to the emotional avoidance and attraction issues is our tendency to exaggerate outcomes. When our inner elephant wants to do something we tend to be overly optimistic about the future and underestimate the potential difficulties. When we don’t, we tend to overstate the potential problems. The problems are obvious. Objectivity is needed if we are to anticipate the future realistically. “The inner elephant tends toward positive or negative exaggerations about the future depending on its emotional orientation toward an object or event." 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Chasing the Wrong Gratification</b>. The inner elephant is child-like and selfish. “Finding happiness is a challenge because the inner elephant often seeks things that do not provide lasting satisfaction.” We can be easily seduced into chasing after the wrongs things—things that don’t bring us lasting satisfaction. 
         <br>
         <br>Daft offers sensible techniques to get some mastery over your inner elephant. He writes, “Let’s face it: 
         <b>Your inner elephant has been running your life</b>. For better or worse, everyone is on automatic pilot more than they realize.” Your best defense is to get to know your inner elephant. Slow down and reflect. While there are negatives, there are strengths that can be harnessed.

          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780446556088.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9780446556088sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Good Boss"></a>
         </div>In another fine offering from Bob Sutton—
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780446556088.html"><i>Good Boss, Bad Boss</i></a>—he makes this attention grabbing statement: “To be a great boss you’ve got to think and act as if it is all about you. Your success depends on being fixated on yourself.” 
         <b>What?</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Ironically, great leaders know that it’s all about them because it isn’t. Great leaders focus on developing themselves so they can develop others. They know themselves first so they can understand others better. They check their own ego so they can build others. They take responsibility for their own actions before they consider looking at others. They have taken an inventory of their strengths and weaknesses so that they know where they need to check themselves and where they need to partner with others. They understand their own failings so that they are more understanding of others. They are appreciative of the room they have been given to grow and make certain they create this space for others. 
         <br>
         <br>It’s about self-awareness. A self-aware leader is in a better position to lead others with authenticity and benevolent concern. Self-aware leaders know how they are coming across to those they lead. Sutton writes, “If you are a boss, your success depends on staying in tune with how others think, feel, and react to you.” 
         <br>
         <br>Sutton offers two acid tests for bosses: 
         <ol>
          <li>Do people want to work for you and would they do so again?</li> 
          <li>Do people feel like you are in tune with what it feels like to work for you?</li>
         </ol> It’s all about you because it 
         <b><i>is</i></b> all about them.

         </div>Chris Thurman wrote in 
         <i>The Lies We Believe</i>, “The number one cause of our unhappiness are the lies we believe in life.” Too often, we operate apart from reality. Given a choice between reality and our version of it, we are inclined to choose the latter. It is a central tendency of human beings. The result is drama not peace. 
         <br>
         <br>“
         <b>Instead of getting the results we want,</b>” says Cy Wakeman, “
         <b>we end up with reasons, stories, and excuses for why things didn’t work out—leading to more drama, disengagement, judgment, and ineffective leadership.</b>” 
         <br>
         <br>In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780470613504.html"><i>Reality-Based Leadership</i></a>, Wakeman presents a much-needed wake-up call. We can ditch the drama by getting in touch with what 
         <b><i>is</i></b>. Quit making up stories. Quit arguing with reality. Ditching the stories that are causing us stress. “We all tell ourselves stories and live with the resulting drama.” It sounds like: 
         <br>
         <br>“I shouldn’t have to do this—it’s not part of my job description. 
         <br>“Our department is always having to clean up after others’ mistakes.” 
         <br>“The boss just doesn’t get it.” 
         <br>“Management only care about the bottom line.” 
         <br>
         <br>“You are arguing with reality whenever you judge your situation in terms of right and wrong instead of fearlessly confronting what is.” You need to respond to the facts, not the story you create about the facts. This is easier said than done. Interwoven in our stories are our egos, insecurities and identities. (At one point Wakeman suggests we ask, “Who am I as a manager or as an employee when I believe this story?”) We like our stories. They make us look better. They place the blame somewhere south of us. If other people are always coming up short in our stories, then it’s all about us. But letting go of our stories is not always easy as we have a lot invested in them. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Too often our criticism is about setting us apart from others and not about helping them.</b> It says a lot more about us than it does those it is directed towards. 
         <br>
         <br>Wakeman says, “When you are judging you are not leading.” In her analysis of case study about Steve and a team he dreaded working with, she concludes, “his biggest obstacle is his belief that they are a negative group. What if he just dropped that whole story and simply responded to reality directly? The phone rings? Answer it. The team asks a question? Answer it, or teach them where to find the answer. The team shares what worked in the past? Listen and lead them into the future. The team requests some time with the leader? Engage with them—lead! When Steve began to lead the team rather than judge and criticize, the team began to change for the better.” She adds, “When you focus your energy on what you are able to give And create rather than what you receive, you are truly serving.” 
         <br>
         <br>Do you see any applications in what you and involved in? Wakeman insightfully writes: “
         <b>What is missing from a situation is that which you are not giving.</b>” 
         <br>
         <br>Operating out of a judging mindset of “I know” or “I am right” effectively shuts down the potential to learn or accomplish anything. Moving on based in reality requires setting the story aside and asking, “If I set the story aside, what would I do to help?” 
         <br>
         <br>The minute you start judging is the very minute you quit leading, serving and adding value. When you’re in judgment, you are dealing with your story—not with reality. Wakeman suggest that when you get off-track: 
         <ol>
          <li><b>Do a reality check.</b> Get back to the facts of the situation b y editing out anything that you can’t absolutely know to be true. “What is the next right action I can take that would add the most value to the situation?” Direct your energy on that action.</li> 
          <li><b>Get clear about motives.</b> Seek to be successful rather than right. Is it about you?</li> 
          <li><b>Be the change.</b> Practice those virtues that you have determined to be lacking in others.</li> 
          <li><b>See others through a lens of love and respect—not anger and fear.</b> When faced with those whose personalities are different from ours, or whose behaviors have reached a stress-induced inappropriateness, work to see through those behaviors and identify their needs or goals. Ask yourself, “What are they striving for?” Then ask, “How can I help them achieve it?”</li> 
          <li><b>Invoke a clearer, higher perspective.</b> When you sense that conflict is getting personal, be prepared to return to a professional perspective by asking your team to clarify the overreaching goal of their work together. “Given our goal, what do you think is the best way to move forward?”</li> 
         </ol> What stories are you telling yourself that causing you to operate in your own world? While it may be cognitively economical, it is costing you far more in every other area.

It is the retelling of the inspiring and remarkable life of Albert Lasker (1880-1952). Lasker has been called the “
         <b>father of modern advertising</b>.” He had an eye for talent and worked with them to transform the advertising agency from mere brokers to a creative force to build businesses. He developed “reason why” advertising—salesmanship in print. 
         <br>
         <br>He made Palmolive and Pepsodent household names and invented the "Sun-Maid" and "Sunkist" brands. He made millions for Quaker Oats, Goodyear, Frigidaire, Lucky Strike and Kimberly-Clark and in the process made millions for himself. He advanced millions to friends during the Depression (most of the loans were never repaid) and when prudent, loaned money to clients to finance their advertising campaigns. 
         <br>
         <br>Lasker was a major investor in the Chicago Cubs. He persuaded William Wrigley to join him in investing in the team. To help the chewing-gum magnate sell more product he pushed to change the name of Cubs Park to Wrigley Field. 
         <br>

         </div>Masterminding the “idea side” of political campaigning, he brought together politics and advertising to help Warren G. Harding win the presidency in 1920. The Hardings and Laskers became good friends dining together at the White House three or four times a week. 
         <br>
         <br>Aided by his personal relationship with many leading businesspeople he “applied the insights he gained in one context to give advice in others.” The legendary David Sarnoff of RCA said of him, “Give him an equal knowledge of the facts and I’d rather have his judgment than anybody else I know.” 
         <br>
         <br>On October 29, 1935, his daughter Mary came to work for him at Lord &amp; Thomas. 
         <b>He left a note on her desk on her first day of work:</b> 
         <blockquote>
          My darling Mary, 
          <br>
          <br>Welcome to Lord &amp; Thomas. I hope we have a long business association together—if we do, we will both get much joy from it. 
          <br>
          <br>Both as father and employer I give you this advice—try to learn from everyone (high and low), try to be of service to everyone (high and low). He finally leads who first learns to serve. And remember—we spend our lives learning. Above all, be yourself—your best self. Always think of the other fellow’s viewpoint and try to get him to think of yours. Learn to walk before you run. Believe in yourself—and believing, strive to learn every day and grow creatively every minute so that you will justify your belief. 
          <br>
          <br>All my love, 
          <br>Father
         </blockquote> 
         <b><i>Just One More:</i></b> In 1938, Lord &amp; Thomas hired the obscure comedian Bob Hope to pitch Pepsodent on the radio. 
         <blockquote>
          Although Lasker enjoyed making and consorting with the stars—and in one case, marrying them—he remained largely unimpressed with them. One day, the head of Lord &amp; Thomas’ broadcast department reported to Lasker that Hope was grumbling about his contract with the agency. “Mr. Lasker,” the subordinate said, “Bob is very unhappy. He says he just can’t put the show together for $4000 a week. He must have $6,000.” “Just between us,” Lasker replied dryly, “I’d rather have Mr. Hope unhappy at $4000 than unhappy at $6,000.”
         </blockquote>

          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780307589132.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9780307589132sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div> Building relationships is about others. It’s more than networking says Tommy Spaulding. “When a heart centered on others drives your actions, networking is replaced by something far, far more powerful—
         <b>Net<i>giving</i></b>. Networking is all about you. Netgiving is all about 
         <i>others</i>.” It's from this sound perspective that Tommy Spaulding writes 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780307589132.html"><i>It’s Not Just Who You Know</i></a>. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <i>It’s Not Just Who You Know</i> is both an inspiring biography and a lesson in initiative and building genuine relationships. Quite often we meet people and build relationships by chance; Spaulding doesn’t believe we should leave them to chance. He has seen over and over again that “an investment in a short-lived and seemingly random encounter can produce unforeseeable yet significant benefits.” So we need to “develop an attitude of openness” and approach “every person we encounter with an awareness of the hidden potential to develop a relationship.” 
         <br>
         <br>Spaulding thinks of relationships in terms of a five story building. 
         <b>Level 1</b> is purely transactional—meet and greet. 
         <b>Level 2</b> you share basic personal information. 
         <b>Level 3</b> relationships, while superficial, relationships have developed an emotional comfort level that goes beyond sharing facts, news weather and sports and involves sharing opinions and feelings with others. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Level 4</b> relationships are marked openness and candidness. We respond in ways that show that we value the relationship for its own sake. The relationship reflects an ability to work through and a willingness to at times, put others interests above your own. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Level 5</b> relationships are our closest and most intimate relationships. They are based more on giving than on getting. “They are relationships based on a shared empathy—an intuitive understanding of each other's needs, even those that aren't necessarily expressed…. In Fifth Floor relationships, we become confidants, advisers, and partners in helping the other person achieve their greatest potential.” 
         <br>
         <br>Spaulding says the goal is to be able to develop the ability to build relationships at all five levels and he offers practical advice for expanding our relationships. It’s not done though through manipulation. Motives matter. Relationships built on getting what you can from others have no lasting value and will more than likely collapse when you need them the most. You can judge your motives by filtering them through the following traits: authenticity, humility, empathy, confidentiality, vulnerability, generosity, humor and gratitude. In building genuine relationships, says Spaulding, 
         <b><i>who</i></b> you are is far more important than 
         <b><i>what</i></b> you do. 
         <br>
         <br>Some of his advice: 
         <ul>
          <li>When you think of the people you are getting to know, take out a piece of paper and write down the back-of-the-business-card information.</li> 
          <li>Take your time to get to know the other person. Don’t push for things you might want; figure out what they need. Don’t be a chirping bird—out for your own self interest.</li> 
          <li>Don’t ask for autographs of influential people and don’t ask to have your picture taken with them. They’ll look at you differently. You want them to look at you as a professional, not as a tourist.</li> 
          <li>If you’re building a relationship with someone, you’re also building a relationship with the people who are important to that person.</li> 
          <li>Find out what the other person thinks rather than telling them what you want.</li> 
          <li>Act on your awareness. Acting out of generosity heightens our awareness about the needs of others (empathy) and builds trust with those around us. If we want our co-workers and customers and vendors to trust us, we have to show them we care about them. But we also have to show them that we care about other people—people who offer us nothing but a heartfelt thank-you (and sometimes not even that).</li> 
          <li>Develop a Fifth Floor all-star team not so much for what that team can do for you, but for what you and that team can do together.</li>
         </ul> As important, Spaulding offers five relationship warnings such as choose wisely and the relationship cancer you must avoid at all costs. He says that Dale Carnegie’s 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781439167342.html" title="How to win friends" target="_blank"><i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i></a> taught him how to get people to fall in love 
         <i>with him</i>. But there is more. We can fall in love

         <i> Leader to Leader</i> that “every exemplary leader that I have met has what seems to be an unwarranted degree of optimism—and that helps generate the energy and commitment necessary to achieve results.” 
         <br>
         <br>Optimism says Bennis, “the sense that things generally work out well, creates tremendous confidence in oneself and in those around one.” Optimism helps leaders to be more resilient as they tend to believe in their capacity for self control and the ability to overcome obstacles that come their way. In short, I would say, optimism is finding perspective.

         </div>In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780470554753.html"><i>The Optimism Advantage</i></a>, Terry Paulson offers fifty truths for cultivating optimism beginning with “Life is Difficult.” (Perhaps not what you would expect from a book on optimism.) He writes, “If you want to be a true optimist, start by being a realist. Accept that life is difficult, and then get busy learning as much as you can about the challenges you face. Why? Because you’ve overcome problems in the past, you have every reason to believe that you’ve got what it takes to overcome whatever problems life deals you.” 
         <br>
         <br>One important place to begin is with our negative thoughts and feelings. Optimists dispute catastrophic thoughts, those “feelings that everything is wrong and that nothing is going to change.” Paulson says that “means you have to be ready to argue with some of your negative beliefs.” Optimism is “about facing and taking advantage of reality—even unsettling reality. Expecting unrealistic results may actually increase your dissatisfaction….To an optimist, it’s all about resilience and maximizing your results.” 
         <br>
         <br>Start with understanding what it is you’re saying to yourself that is causing a bigger problem in your thinking. Clarify it and then take a critical look at your beliefs and dispute them. Are they valid? Is there another way to look at this? Seek alternate explanations. Optimists ask, “Is there any less destructive way to look at this or explain what happened?” Look for causes that you can overcome and focus on what can be changed and then take action.

         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780470531921.html"><i>No More Excuses</i></a> by Sam Silverstein is about expanding your accountability zone. To do that it means “reaching the point in your life where you can say, ‘No More Excuses! I’m not going to make excuses, and I’m not going to buy excuses.’” Excuses only legitimize the past, ignore the present, and eliminate the future. 
         <br>
         <br>Silverstein’s book is built around 
         <b><i>The Five Accountabilities</i></b> he has developed to help you—in a practical way—to move beyond the excuse; to make accountability a way of life for you personally and part of your organization’s culture. The five accountabilities are: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Doing the Right Things.</b> Begin by identifying your strategic intent. What are you trying to accomplish and by when? We are accountable for understanding and identifying our strategic intent—and the activities that support it. 
         <blockquote>
          Mt. Everest climber Ronnie Muhl, told Sam: “You get into the habit of asking yourself, ‘If my life depended on the next action I took, how differently would I perform that action?’ —because doing the wrong thing can have massive consequences.”
         </blockquote> 
         <b>Managing Your Space.</b> We are accountable to create the new space we need to grow and innovate in our own lives, which sometimes means taking space from something else that we’re doing. “Force of habit prevents us from giving ourselves the physical, mental, financial, or emotional space necessary to shake things up a little bit and put something new in our lives—something that could provide growth and improvement.” 
         <blockquote>
          David Silverstein, CEO of the Breakthrough Management Group International, told Sam, “You have to be willing to cannibalize your own business in order to grow.”
         </blockquote> 
         <b>Managing the Process.</b> We are accountable for creatively making progress toward whatever it is we are trying to make happen even when we hit an obstacle. It means not throwing up our hands and saying, “If it’s not meant to be, it’s not meant to be.” 
         <blockquote>
          Kenneth Evans, Dean of Price College of Business at the University of Oklahoma told Sam, “The real problem with the way that some people look at accountability is that oftentimes it’s layered into a notion of a rigid set of expectations and performance parameters, and frankly, you can get into very deep trouble if that’s your mantra. How you react to changing events is important as well.”
         </blockquote> 
         <b>Establishing the Right Expectations.</b> We are accountable for establishing the right expectations, that reflect our values, that are properly benchmarked, and are a bit of a stretch. 
         <blockquote>
          Clothier Elim Chew, spoke to Sam about the leading from where you are at his company 77th Street, “The people who accept responsibility for, say, 10 things that are part of their job description and then accept personal accountability for five more things all on their own are the ones who are more likely to get the bigger bonuses and bigger raises in this company. They’re the ones who may end up running a business of their own someday.”
         </blockquote> 
         <b>Contributing to Your Relationships</b>. The success or failure of our relationships depends entirely on the contributions we make. We are accountable for giving to our relationships—without keeping track. “In fact, the quickest way to kill a relationship is to start keeping track of all the reasons it’s not your turn to give to it and support it.” Sam adds, “We should constantly be looking for ways to invest in the relationship and enhance the value of the relationship over time.” Sam says, “Building relationships is about choices, and the choices should always be based on your values. To get a fix on your values, ask yourself: How can I best serve this relationship in the short term and the long term?” 
         <blockquote>
          Brian Martin, CEO and founder of Brand Connections, talked to Sam about managing emotions. He said, “I have asked every single person I’ve hired two questions: ‘First, what is most important for you to feel professionally, every day? And second, what’s most important for you to avoid feeling? What would you really rather not go through, not have to replay with your spouse at the end of the day, when that person asks how your day went?’ I keep the answers on file, and I look at those answers every week when I do my own planning.”
         </blockquote> Free tools and exercises are available at 
         <a href="http://samsilverstein.com/Downloads/" title="Sam Silverstein" target="_blank">SamSilverstein.com</a> to help you implement the Five Accountabilities. “If you want to build an organization that achieves its goals and beats the competition, it’s time for No More Excuses.”

         </div>Excuses are insidious things that get in the way of moving forward. Eliminate them. 
         <br>
         <br>Brian Tracy, a man who needs no introduction, says 
         <b>the way out of the morass created by excuses is <i>self-discipline</i></b>. Elbert Hubbard defines self-discipline as the ability to do what you should do, when you should do it, whether you feel like it or not. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781593155827.html"><i>No Excuses!</i></a> is a primer on self-discipline and full of those kinds of things that will make you reconsider the habits you have gotten into. Tracy cites Kop Kopmeyer: 
         <b>“There are 999 other success principles that I have found in my reading and experience, but without self-discipline, none of them work. With self-discipline they all work.”</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Tracy examines how the practice of self-discipline impacts twenty-one areas of your personal, business, sales and financial life such as character development, goal setting, leadership, health and family. The pull to take the path of least resistance and to do what is expedient, says Tracy is our worst enemy. Looking only to the short-term “most people do what is 
         <b><i>expedient</i></b>, what is fun and easy rather than what is 
         <b><i>necessary</i></b> for success.” 
         <br>
         <br>In a personal example, Tracy recalls at age 21 that it dawned on him that “this is my life. This was not a rehearsal for something else. The game was on, and I was the main character, as in a play.” That realization changed his life and he resolved to take more responsibility for his life and take a “no excuses” approach to every aspect of his life. 
         <br>
         <br>“In its simplest form,” says Tracy, “the role of the leader is to take responsibility for results.” This involves developing a vision for yourself and for your areas of responsibility. 
         <br>
         <br>[As an aside to the vision thing, on Twitter today, 
         <a href="http://twitter.com/tom_peters" title="Tom Peters" target="_blank">Tom Peters</a> said that maybe it’s just semantics but, “Don’t especially like 
         <i>vision</i>. Prefer 
         <i>portrait</i>. E.g.: ‘
         <b><i>Leaders paint portraits of Excellence.</i></b>’” 
         <a href="http://twitter.com/PhilGerb" title="Gerbyshak" target="_blank">Phil Gerbyshak</a> filled in some of the details of Tom’s thought by stating that he thinks “leaders provide the outline for excellence and allow others to fill in the colors and add details/meaning.” Good food for thought. Does 
         <i>portrait</i> put a face on it—responsibility?] 
         <br>
         <br>Continuing on, Tracy says that leaders must take the responsibility to be role models and set the example. “There is a direct relationship between your ability to discipline yourself and your behaviors and your readiness to lead.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>The bottom-line of self-discipline is peace of mind.</b> Peace of mind because you consistently do what needs to be done and have developed the self-discipline needed to let go of the negative events that happen to you—forgive and forget—and focus your energy instead on taking responsibility and moving forward. “Discipline yourself to stop justifying your negative emotions by continually rehashing what happened and what the other person did or didn’t do.” Tracy adds, “Your ability to achieve your own peace of mind is the true measure of your success and the key determinant of your happiness.”

         </div>Monica Diaz has written a short but key book on developing productive and sustainable relationships. 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781442186620.html"><i>Otheresteem</i></a> is about how valuing others can enhance your work, your family, your business and yourself. 
         <br>
         <br>Otheresteem is a word to describe the value you have of another person and the feeling that that view brings out in you. It’s begins by taking responsibility for the quality of the relationships you have with others. Diaz says that otheresteem is a practice that involves four behaviors: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Acceptance</b>: Valuing others for who they are now. Not trying to change them, but to understand them. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Appreciation</b>: Valuing others means that you can—and make an effort to—see things that you value in them. “If we can learn to appreciate something in the other person, we can build a relationship different from competitiveness, from hatred, from alienation.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Expectation</b>: Valuing others not just for what they are, but for what you know they can be. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Gratitude</b>: Feeling and demonstrating gratitude for the relationship you have with another is a natural result of acceptance, appreciation and expectation. “As with appreciation, being grateful for my relationship with you does not mean I approve of your every move…. It means I have become wise enough to find some small jewel in this exchange.” 
         <br>
         <br>In building your otheresteem remember, “You are working on yourself, not them. The primary intention is to change the way you perceive and treat them, to build on the value you place on them as collaborators.” 
         <blockquote>
          Understand that you are only to change yourself, and that is exactly what you are setting off to do: change the way you value this person, regardless of your past experiences together and without a set agenda of how you expect them to contribute to the cause. The more you let go of preconceived notions of what the other must do, the more effective your quest for collaboration and mutual learning.
         </blockquote> Through examples and the lessons learned from them, Diaz demonstrates how otheresteem is possible in not only the workplace, but anywhere you find people in your life. It is not unusual for people to wonder, “Yeah, but if it am busy valuing others—especially in the workplace—then what about me? Don’t I get left behind?” As odd as it seems, otheresteem—esteeming others—is the antidote to the question, “What about me?” By esteeming others you are building your self-esteem—and we greatly improve the world we live in. 
         <br>
         <br>Why Otheresteem? Because of the kind of person it makes you.

         <b>“Everyone can lead because everyone can serve,”</b> says James Strock. “When service is the basis of leadership, 
         <i>everyone</i> can be a leader.” What’s more, “We’re in a new era, with new rules, new ways to serve—and much greater accountability.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780984077403.html"><i>Serve to Lead</i></a> puts the focus of leadership where it should be. Too often, people think of leadership as being about the leader. A leader who serves has greater influence. Service—not control—leads to trust and increased influence. 
         <br>
         <br>In an excellent chapter on management, Strock helps to place management and leadership in perspective and explains some of the nuances of tough love and accountability. “Management is encompassed within leadership.” As leaders we must develop management skills. 
         <blockquote>
          “Ultimately, management is a key to extraordinary service. Individual performance has the limitations of an individual. You may be a virtuoso. Yet, if you are determined to express your individuality in a more expansive way, you must develop management skills and engage others in a larger enterprise. 
          <br>
          <br>To achieve ever deeper relationships with greater numbers of customers and other stakeholders, you must master management. Day in and day out, that means you must serve those with whom you work, enabling them to serve ever more effectively.
         </blockquote> Filled with examples and quotes, 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780984077403.html"><i>Serve to Lead</i></a> is well thought out and one of the best books you’ll read on how to think about service and how to get your leadership to be one of service. 
         <br>
         <br>Strock urges us to 
         <b>make our life a masterpiece of service</b>. It begins by asking the question—who am I serving—throughout our life, minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day. Importantly, it is not a question that we should apply to only one area of our life. It should be an approach we take in all areas of our life—our time, our money, our relationships and thoughts. 
         <br>
         <br>As an ongoing practice, he suggests we continually ask ourselves four questions: 
         <br>
         <br>Who am I serving? 
         <br>How can I best serve? 
         <br>Am I making my unique contribution? 
         <br>Am I getting better every day? 
         <br>
         <br>Service isn’t easy. It doesn’t always get noticed, but it is what leading is all about. If that is hard to swallow, you need to ask yourself, why do I want to lead? 
         <blockquote>
          How many people are trapped in their everyday habits: part numb, part frightened, part indifferent? To have a better life we must keep choosing how we’re living. 
          <br>

He left behind a wide range of comments regarding leadership ideas and principles. 
         <br>
         <br>It could be said that he believed in 
         <b>Management By Wandering Around</b>. In his autobiography he wrote, "In religion and politics people's beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second-hand, and without examination, from authorities who have not themselves examined the questions at issue but have taken them at second-hand from other non-examiners, whose opinions about them were not worth a brass farthing." Firsthand knowledge is a competitive advantage. 
         <ul>
          <li>A statesman gains little by the arbitrary exercise of ironclad authority upon all occasions that offer, for this wounds the just pride of his subordinates, and thus tends to undermine his strength. A little concession, now and then, where it can do no harm is the wiser policy. (From <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i>)</li> 
          <li>The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who cannot read them.</li> 
          <li>The miracle, or the power, that elevates the few is to be found in their perseverance under the promptings of a brave, determined spirit.</li>
         </ul> 
         <b>On Encouragement:</b> 
         <ul>
          <li>I can live for two months on a good compliment.</li>
         </ul> 
         <b>On Success:</b> 
         <ul>
          <li>Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.</li> 
          <li>Success is a journey, not a destination. It requires constant effort, vigilance and re-evaluation.</li> 
          <li>The secret of success is making your vocation your vacation.</li> 
          <li>Work and play are words used to describe the same thing under differing conditions.</li>
         </ul> 
         <b>On Courage:</b> 
         <ul>
          <li>Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear - not absence of fear. Except a creature be part coward it is not a compliment to say it is brave. (From <i>The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>)</li> 
          <li>It is curious that physical courage should be so common in the world and moral courage so rare.</li>
         </ul> 
         <b>On Vision:</b> 
         <ul>
          <li>You cannot depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus.</li> 
          <li>Don't part with your illusions. When they are gone, you may still exist, but you have ceased to live.</li>
         </ul> 
         <b>On Execution:</b> 
         <ul>
          <li>The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex, overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.</li> 
          <li>Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.</li>
         </ul> 
         <b>On Ethics:</b> 
         <ul>
          <li>Always do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest.</li> 
          <li>I am different from [George] Washington; I have a higher, grander standard of principle. Washington could not lie. I can lie, but I won't.</li>
         </ul> 
         <b>On Communication:</b> 
         <ul>
          <li>The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and the lightning bug.</li> 
          <li>It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt.</li> 
          <li>If you have nothing to say, say nothing.</li>
         </ul> Twain was not a successful businessman. After emerging from bankruptcy in 1901, Twain advised, "To succeed in business, avoid my example." He was however, a witty and shrewd moralist and critic of human nature. A century after he wrote his last words, Twain still remains relevant.

         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780061894084.html"><i>The Little Big Things</i></a> by Tom Peters, is all about. 
         <br>
         <br>Some of what you will read in 
         <i>TLBT</i> has been presented on the Tom Peters 
         <a href="http://www.tompeters.com/" title="Tom Peters Blog" target="_blank">blog</a> over the years. But for this book, the posts have been edited, revised, organized and conveniently packaged. It’s a compilation of 163 behaviors you can put into practice to achieve excellence in any endeavor. As such, it is not meant to be read straight through. Jump in anywhere it looks interesting. The process here is: read—consider—implement—repeat. 
         <br>
         <br>Tom, as we’ve said here before, is good at boiling things down to basics. You’ll find opportunities to pursue excellence in basic insights that produce big results. 
         <blockquote>
          Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.
          <br>
          <div align="right">
           —Henry Clay, American statesman (1777-1852)
          </div>
         </blockquote> Sometimes the little-big-things can seem too “soft” or beneath the demands of business. Tom explains: “Ideas like conscientiously showing appreciation are matchless signs of humanity—and the practice thereof, in my opinion, doubtless makes you a better person, a person behaving decently in a hurried and harried world….Acts of appreciation, to stick with my theme of the moment, are masterful, even peerless, ways of enthusing staff and partner and client alike, and, hence, greasing the way to rapid implementation of damn near anything. That is, ‘Soft is hard’ is wholly pragmatic—and more often than not, effectively implemented, makes the bottom line blossom!” 
         <br>
         <br>Excellence has to be challenged into existence. 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780061894084.html"><i>The Little Big Things</i></a> does just that.

         <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/testyourmojo.gif" width="170" height="250" align="left" alt="mojo">
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781401323271.html" title="Mojo">Mojo</a> is that positive spirit toward what we are doing now that starts from the inside and radiates to the outside, writes Marshall Goldsmith. It’s that sense others get about us that comes from the harmony between what we feel about what we are doing and what we show on the outside. It’s about two simple goals: loving what you do and showing it. 
         <br>
         <br>The kind of positive impression you make profoundly affects your ability to influence. Mojo can make or break your leadership effectiveness. The greater your Mojo, the more times you’ll ring the bell. 
         <br>
         <br>Goldsmith says that 
         <b>four ingredients</b> need to be combined in order for you to have great Mojo: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Identity</b>: 
         <i>Who you think you are?</i> Or how do you perceive yourself? Our identity is created in a number of ways: remembered (life experience), reflected (what others think of us), programmed (what others think we should be) and created (what we consciously choose to be). “To change your Mojo, you may need to either create a new identity for yourself or rediscover an identity that you have lost.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Achievement</b>: 
         <i>What have you done lately?</i> There is a difference between what we think we achieve and what others think we achieve. When these get out of sync we can have a Mojo crisis. Understand what "achievement" means to you. “Try not to go through life deluding yourself by pretending that when the world cares, you do—or pretending that when the world does not care, you do not care.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Reputation</b>: 
         <i>What do other people think you are?</i> Your reputation is a scoreboard kept by others. You can’t control it, but if it’s killing your Mojo, there's a lot you can do to improve it. You can choose the reputation you want if you are disciplined enough to live out your objectives in daily, consistent behaviors. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Acceptance</b>: 
         <i>What can you change, and what is beyond your control?</i> Acceptance means you dispense with what Goldsmith calls the 
         <i>Great Western Disease</i>—the “I’ll be happy when…” statement. You know how it goes: “I will be happy when I have a million dollars in the bank, when my house is bigger, or when I look the way I want.” There’s nothing wrong with wanting those things but we often fixate on the future at the expense of enjoying the life we’re living 
         <i>now</i>. Worse still we whine, complain and lay blame for things that happen to us instead of taking it all in stride. “By carrying around anger and negative baggage, we weigh ourselves down. We limit our opportunities to find meaning and happiness. We kill our Mojo.”

         </div> 
         <br>
         <br>We 
         <b>kill our Mojo</b> by committing mistakes like these: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Over-committing.</b> When you're bursting with Mojo, everybody wants you be a part of what your doing. This can lead to over-commitment. It is “one of the sweet but risky blowbacks from having Mojo." Understandably we don’t want to look weak, naturally we loved to be included, or perhaps we think we’re superhuman, but whatever the case it can kill our Mojo. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Waiting For the Facts to Change.</b> This is wishful thinking. It is a common response to a setback. It’s the opposite of over-committing because while you’re waiting for a more comfortable set of facts to appear, you do nothing. Goldsmith helpfully advises: “When the facts are not to your liking, ask yourself, ‘What path would I take if I knew that the situation would not get better?’ Then get ready to do that.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Looking For Logic in All the Wrong Places.</b> Humans are not always logical, yet we persist in trying to find logic where no logic exists or try to prove others wrong with our superior logic. Again Goldsmith nails it: “The next time you pride yourself on your superior ‘logic’ and damage relationships with people you need at work—or the people you love at home—ask yourself, ‘How logical was that?’” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Bashing the Boss.</b> This should speak for itself. See acceptance. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Refusing to Change Because of “Sunk Costs.”</b> “We persist in error,” says Goldsmith, “because we cannot admit error.” If your decisions are based on what you have to 
         <i>lose</i> instead of what you have to 
         <i>gain</i>, your “sunk costs” may be costing you more than you know. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Confusing the Mode You’re In.</b> There is our professional mode and our relaxed mode. And we shift between the two without even thinking about it. “The executives you most admire tend to be those who, with constant discipline, never drift out of professional mode….They have chosen a role for themselves, and they rarely go off script. They are professionals. That’s why they have Mojo.” 
         <br>
         <br>In the final chapters of the book, you will find 14 tools to help you build, rebuild or redefine your Mojo. Goldsmith pours his understanding of people and situations, gained from years of experience, into this book. Acting on his wisdom will save you the unnecessary detours so common to the human condition.

         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781591843160.html" title="Linchpin" target="_blank"><i>Linchpin</i></a> is about personal leadership and is the most leadership oriented book Godin has written to date. He makes a good case for developing yourself to reach your potential against the backdrop of the changing workplace. Changing workplace or not, it is the thing to do. 
         <br>
         <br>In the industrial workplace it was easier, even expected that you could hide behind your job in exchange for job security. “You weren’t born to be cog in the giant industrial machine. You were 
         <i>trained</i> to become cog.” (His assessment of our educational system is spot on.) Today successful companies are looking for people who make a difference—
         <i>linchpins</i>. 
         <br>
         <br>“Linchpins are the essential building blocks of tomorrow’s high-value organizations. They don’t bring capital or expensive machinery, nor do they blindly follow instructions and merely contribute labor.” Linchpins don’t worry about what’s in it for them, but instead focus on giving gifts that change people. They can see the reality of today and describe a better tomorrow. That is, if they can ignore that voice inside that tells them to keep their head down, don’t make waves, don’t stand out. Godin identifies that voice as your 
         <i>lizard brain</i>. 
         <br>
         <br>Overcoming the lizard brain takes training. “In the face of greed or fear from the amygdala [a-MIG-da-la 
         <i>or</i> lizard brain], an untrained person surrenders.” “The goal,” says Godin, “is to quit the tasks you’re doing because you’re hiding on behalf of the lizard brain and to push through the very tasks the lizard fears.” He notes, “Ironically, it’s those who seek out discomfort that are able to make a difference and find their footing.” 
         <br>
         <br>The good news is that this doesn’t necessarily mean you need to change your job, your boss or your co-workers. That wouldn’t solve your problem anyway. The problem rests with you—your attitude. The difference between a cog and a linchpin really comes down to attitude. It requires a change of attitude. It means choosing to do your old job in a new way. 
         <br>
         <br>A choice to not hide your best work. A choice to find 
         <i>your</i> opportunities to make something happen. A choice to overcome the resistance you face in doing your work because what you have to offer is important enough to make the effort. 
         <br>
         <br> The subtitle of the book asks, “Are you indispensable?” When talking about being indispensable, we need to distinguish between your value and your attitude. By developing your unique gifts—becoming more of who you are—you are increasing your value, exposing your gifts, and making yourself indispensable in a “there is no one like you” sense. That’s different than 
         <i>thinking</i> you are indispensable. That’s an attitude that will lead you to self-destruction. (
         <a href="http://www.n2growth.com/blog/indispensable-i-think-not/" title="indispensable" target="_blank">Mike Myatt</a> expresses well the pitfalls of that kind of thinking.) I don’t think Godin is advocating arrogance or parading a “you can’t do without me" attitude. Instead, he is advocating that we make the choice to develop our unique combination of gifts and give them to the world in a way that makes a difference—to change people’s lives with what is the indispensable contribution that every human being can make if they will but choose to overcome the resistance to play it safe and aim for average.

Successful organizations are built on relationships. Leadership is all about relationships. But how important is modeling loyalty in everything you do? 
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="img" style="margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">

         </div>It is hard to talk about sustainability, community, personal responsibility and relationships without talking about loyalty. Yet we do. 
         <br>
         <br>Loyalty has become a commodity that we hold or withhold—a tool to vote with—a means to express our discontent on a whim. Abiding commitments are seen as old-fashioned. Impatience, irritability and selfishness all drive the need to look for greener pastures. “In a strange way,” said Jack Valenti, “loyalty is now seen as some kind of character flaw.” In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781933771724.html"><i>Why Loyalty Matters</i></a>, authors Timothy Keiningham and Lerzan Aksoy write: 
         <blockquote>
          The possibility of leaving applies to some degree to our relationships with everyone. Weak friendships, dysfunctional families, bad marriages, intolerant religious institutions, and inept governments all face the prospect of abandonment. And there are indeed times when leaving is the best option. 
          <br>
          <br>But 
          <b>society cannot function and relationships cannot last if leaving is the readily selected, probable outcome to every perceived grievance</b>. And while few would admit to cutting and running when times get tough, many, if not most of us, have a general sense that leaving has become too easy for many.
         </blockquote> Loyalty is about making commitments to causes, people and ideas through thick and thin, for better or for worse. It is about service to something greater than ourselves. 
         <br>
         <br>Keiningham and Aksoy define loyalty as “accepting the bonds that our relationships with others entail, and acting in a way that 
         <b>defends and reinforces</b> the attachment inherent in those relationships.” Loyalty is implicit in all relationships and the lack of it is eroding our sense of well-being and happiness. Our priorities are often misplaced. They write, “The problem isn’t that we are exchanging our time for commodities, but instead we are exchanging our family’s time, our friends’ time, our ideals’ time to get some
         <i>thing</i>.” 
         <br>
         <br>Of course, we like to see ourselves as more loyal than we are and everyone else as less loyal than they really are. But, “it is our unwillingness to 
         <b>see our own role</b> in the general decline of loyalty that is a major cause of relationship disintegration. And this disintegration ultimately leads to our unhappiness.” 
         <br>
         <br>Long-term thinking helps to develop loyalty. Professor Richard Sennett observed, “’No long term’ is a principle which corrodes trust, loyalty, and mutual commitment … social bonds take time to develop, slowly rooting into the cracks and crevices of institutions.” Leaders are hard pressed to function without it. 
         <br>
         <br>We develop and model loyalty in the seemingly small choices we make every day. “If loyalty is to be an important part of our lives, then we must become aware of the ramifications of our decisions. Living a loyal life requires that we recognize the formal and implicit commitments we have made to others. We must then make deliberate choices to strengthen our bonds by honoring our commitments.” The authors suggest a process they call 
         <b><i>P2R2</i></b>. It stands for: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Pinpoint Where You Are:</b> Where do you stand? We believe we are far more loyal than the recipients of our loyalty believe us to be. They offer the online 
         <a href="http://www.loyaltyadvisor.com" title="LoyaltyAdvisior" target="_blank"><i>LoyaltyAdvisior</i></a> assessment to aid you in determining where you are. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Prioritize Those Things That Matter:</b> If we want to make loyalty a meaningful part of our everyday existence, then we need to understand where we are actually spending our time and then prioritize. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Reinforce Your Connections:</b> Actively schedule time to connect with those to whom we owe loyalty. “It will mean that there will be times we must sacrifice doing things that would be more fun to help a friend in need.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Reach Out To Others:</b> Engage beyond your friends and family. “It says, this relationship, this institution, this cause is mine, and I will not abandon it.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781933771724.html"><i>Why Loyalty Matters</i></a> delves deeply into the issue of loyalty. They discuss the economics of loyalty, the problem of misplaced loyalty, faith and loyalty, and an important chapter on teaching loyalty. President Theodore Roosevelt warned, “To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.” 
         <br>
         <br>Oprah Winfrey sums up the need well: “Lots of people want to ride with you in the limo, but what you want is someone who will take the bus with you when the limo breaks down.”

         <i>paradox</i> “almost seems too mild a word to describe the challenges facing the social leaders of today.” He adds, the best leaders “thrive on differences and ambiguity, and find solutions amid this large tolerance for social complexity.” 
         <br>
         <br>In his innovation playbook for uncertain times, 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781422139011.html"><i>The Silver Lining</i></a>, Scott Anthony writes, “Existing systems, structures, and development programs that were sufficient for leaders to thrive in an era of ordered capitalism are proving to be inadequate in today’s increasingly turbulent times. Most leaders just aren't ready to grapple with the paradoxes that will increasingly characterize their day-to-day lives.” He lists, for example, these seemingly paradoxical requirements facing leaders: 
         <ul>
          <li>I have to focus on running operations with laserlike precision without stifling creativity.</li> 
          <li>I exist because of my big business, but “small saplings” are critical for long-term success.</li> 
          <li>Data drives my decisions, but I have to trust intuition and judgment when data doesn’t exist or is vague.</li> 
          <li>Attention to detail and focus on numbers has allowed me to progress in my career, but too much focus on details or numbers can crowd out innovation.</li> 
          <li>The people I trust the most are people who deliver short-term results and never surprise me, but innovation almost always involves some kind of surprise.</li> 
          <li>I have to leverage my capabilities to win today’s battles while walking away from many of these capabilities to win tomorrow’s battles.</li> 
         </ul> To this we might add the ability to look at solutions to problems that have more than one solution or seemingly opposing goals—serving shareholders and our communities, to grow and be good stewards. If you have a low tolerance for opposing thoughts you are less likely to look for other alternatives. This greatly limits your ability to adapt to changing circumstances. 
         <br>
         <br>Anthony reports that it has been estimated that no more than 5 percent of the manager population can truly grapple with paradox. Why? He says that “Michael Putz from Cisco has studied this problem for the past decade. His perspective is that the problem isn’t a lack of basic intelligence, desire, or capacity. Rather, managers haven’t developed the ability to grapple with paradox because they 
         <i>haven’t needed to</i>.” 
         <br>
         <br>But the capacity to deal with paradox, to work with opposable ideas, is learnable. Again, self-awareness is key. Understand how you view the world. Then, creating a specific developmental program to help you take a broader view, to integrate multiple perspectives, to view solutions as both/and instead of either/or, will help you pass the 
         <i>Fitzgerald Test</i>.

         </div>We all make them. Ethics breaches, sex scandals and performance-related turnover are increasingly found in today’s headlines. As in tennis, the unforced error is made by someone with the ability to keep the ball in play but who makes a mistake, resulting in the loss of a point. To improve your game you need to develop the habits that will help you keep the ball in play. It is your performance over time—a steady game—that will get you where you want to go. That’s what 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781591842835.html"><i>The Unforced Error</i></a> by Jeffrey Krames aims to help you do. 
         <br>
         <br>The most dangerous errors—and the one discussed in this book—are “the ones we don’t recognize, so we can’t fix them before the damage is done.” Krames divides unforced errors into two groups: the 
         <b><i>unforced operating error</i></b> (the ones we all make in the course of doing our job; a bad call) and the 
         <b><i>unforced nonoperating error</i></b> (errors not directly related to the conducting of business, but can shatter a career nonetheless; sexual affairs and errors of character). Krames writes, “There are seldom excuses for unforced nonoperating errors. You have to have the awareness, self-control, and maturity to avoid them.” The focus of this book is the former kind, the unforced 
         <b><i>operating</i></b> error. 
         <br>
         <br>There is a key to avoiding unforced errors. Not surprisingly, 
         <b>the key is humility</b>. “That’s because humility—one of the most underrated of all leadership qualities—is essential to developing the strength and consistency to avoid unforced errors.” It’s the kind of humility that comes from having the self-confidence to admit mistakes, blind spots and then move on to correct the mistake. Rarely would you be told that you were fired due to a lack of humility, but it is the trigger for so many unforced errors. Krames successfully helps you to recognize an unforced error when you see it. In each chapter that covers a specific unforced error, he offers sensible and pragmatic advice on how to avoid these “career killers.” His advice includes: 
         <ul>
          <li>Never say the ball was out by a mile. Face reality at all times.</li> 
          <li>Nothing is as important as people decisions. Get the right people.</li> 
          <li>When you do make a people mistake, fix it as quickly as possible.</li> 
          <li>Don’t overlook the wild card. Develop the next generation of leaders.</li> 
          <li>Keep your game inbounds. Living and leading by the rules.</li> 
          <li>Step up to the net. Take ownership of your part of the court.</li> 
          <li>Watch the whole court. Find out who the real line judge is in your game and make sure they know how you’re doing.</li> 
         </ul> Krames is very readable as always. The tennis metaphor works well to demonstrate the importance of these ideas. If you take the time to study the advice Kramer has gathered together, you could save yourself from committing these errors. In the words of Billie Jean King, “Self-awareness is probably the most important thing towards being a champion.”

         <h2 class="title">Lift: How to Be a Positive Force in Any Situation</h2> To overcome the force of gravity—that which pulls us down—we have to generate an opposing force greater than gravity. That force is 
         <i>lift</i>. Any opposition to lift is called 
         <i>drag</i>. 
         <br>
         <br>In the same way that we use the laws of physical science to lift a plane off the ground, we can use social science to lift “ourselves and others up to greater heights of achievement, integrity, learning, and love,” thereby becoming a positive force in any situation. It’s the pressures of daily living that drag us down. Instead of experiencing lift we fall back into our comfort zones, become reactive, self-centered and fatalistic. 
         <br>
         <br>To intentionally experience lift and to be a positive influence for others, we have to make a conscious choice.

         </div>In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781576754443.html"><i>Lift: Becoming a Positive Force in Any Situation</i></a>, authors Ryan and Robert Quinn present this fitting metaphor, to explain how we can intentionally experience lift, to rise above the constraints of everyday life and lift the people around us. “All of us have a choice: we can choose to be the kind of people who drag others down or to be the kind of people who lift…. We are relational beings. 
         <b>Who we are at any time depends on who the people around us are, and who they are depends on who we are.</b>” That last sentence can’t be overemphasized. It carries with it a great deal of responsibility, especially for us as leaders. 
         <br>
         <br>The authors describe 
         <i>lift</i> as “
         <b>a psychological state in which a person is purpose-centered, internally directed, other-focused, and externally open</b>.” What exactly are these four characteristics of lift? In a very relatable and revealing example—the parenting of a young son, Mason—the authors show how this plays out in real life. I can’t reproduce the example here, but I think from the inferences you will get the idea the authors are trying to convey. The following is paraphrased from their work: 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Purpose-centered</b> is the opposite of being comfort-centered. The desire to stay comfortable is a characteristic of a normal psychological state. My son Mason’s behaviors were comfortable for me. In my desire for comfort, what had not occurred to me was the possibility that perhaps Mason was behaving differently because of the changes that had happened recently in his life. We need to ask, “Are the results I am trying to create about me and what I am comfortable with or are they about what is best for the other person?” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Internally directed</b> is when people experience the dignity and integrity that comes with exercising the self-control necessary to live up to the values that they expect of others. External direction, on the other hand, is a characteristic of a normal psychological state. 
         <blockquote>
          If Mason was building with his Legos or playing a game when I asked him to do something, I expected him to put those things aside and do it. Yet, if I was involved in an activity and Mason interrupted me, I would expect him to wait until I was done with my activity before I did what he asked. I expected him to show respect to me, but I was not doing the same for him....When people are externally directed, they let circumstances (such as the need to get Mason to clean up or go to bed) drive their behavior instead of their values (such as respect for others’ time and activities).
         </blockquote> 
         <b>Other-focused</b> is to be open to other people’s feelings and needs. We then empathize with them and feel impulses to be compassionate. When we are self-focused, we are concerned only with our own needs, feelings, and wants. We see other people as objects that either help us or impede us in our goals. In my case, Mason was an object that was preventing me from my goal of showing that I was a good father. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>Externally open</b> is openness to external cues. When we are open we learn, grow and adapt ourselves to the situation unfolding before us. When we are internally closed, we ignore and deny feedback. We ignore or deny feedback out of fear that the feedback says something about our worth as human beings. So as a result, we tend to get angry. Again with Mason, I was not showing him the respect that I wanted him to show me. As I opened myself to the possibility that I might be wrong, I also opened myself up to what Mason was feeling, and to what his needs might be and became other-focused. 
         <br>
         <br>Using scientific research to provide “insight into why lift is important, what the characteristics of lift are, and how our psychological states influence others,” they formulated four questions that capture the nuances required to intentionally move ourselves from a normal state into lift. 
         <ol>
          <li><b><i>What results do I want to create?</i></b> (When people answer this question they become less comfort-centered and more purpose-centered.)</li> 
          <li><b><i>What would my story be if I were living the values I expect of others?</i></b> (When people answer this question they become less externally directed and more internally directed.)</li> 
          <li><b><i>How do others feel about this situation?</i></b> (When people answer this question they become less self-focused and more other-focused.)</li> 
          <li><b><i>What are three (or four or five) strategies I could use to accomplish my purpose for this situation?</i></b> (When people answer this question they become less internally closed and more externally open.)</li>
         </ol> This post is getting long, but I would like to share several more thoughts for you to contemplate: 
         <blockquote>
          When a new situation disrupts our previous expectations, though, it is more productive to change our expectations than to try to make the world conform to our old expectations. 
          <br>
          <br>A purpose-centered state involves more than having a goal. When people are purpose-centered, they envision and pursue extraordinary results that are not constrained by previous expectations or by the expectations they receive from others. 
          <br>
          <br>Self-regulation is the process of using one’s conscious mind to inhibit one’s automatic response to the situation and to replace it with a controlled response. 
          <br>
          <br>Since he was not focused on himself, he was not worried about people taking advantage of him.
         </blockquote> The book is full of great examples and scientific evidence to back their perspective. The scientific evidence is really just icing on the cake. The relational principles at work here are sound, but they require much thought and self-examination. This is a book that needs to be read and re-read. Inertia is our biggest enemy. Inertia will keep us from benefiting from this book and becoming a positive force; the kind of leaders that provide 
         <i>lift</i> in our own lives and those we influence.

         </div>Air Force fighter pilot Rob “Waldo” Waldman learned how to overcome fear, anxiety, and self-doubt to fly combat missions that pushed him to his limits by disciplined training and the help of his wingmen. Wingmen are people with different backgrounds, skills, and experiences unified under one agreement—
         <b>to never think or act alone</b>. 
         <br>
         <br>A wingman watches your back. In 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780071637060.html"><i>Never Fly Solo</i></a>, Waldo threads real world experiences to encourage the development of a 
         <b><i>check-six culture</i></b>. 
         <i>Check-six</i> refers to the six o’clock position where the jet is most vulnerable—the pilot’s blind spot. 
         <br>
         <br>Waldo says, “There is a limit to how much you can learn on your own. A good wingman will give you mission-critical feedback, catch your errors, ask questions, and propose challenging scenarios to push you to grow in your skills and mental discipline.” Encouraging others to look out for our blind spots requires a great deal of mutual trust. “These trusted partners, male or female, are your wingmen.” 
         <br>
         <br>Of course, this means first, not being afraid to acknowledge that you need help and then being able to ask for it. This is all the more difficult if you haven’t built trust in yourself and invested the time to build trusting relationships with others. You’ve got to “walk the flight line.” Get out and build relationships with those people you work with—treating each other as people first and coworkers second. “It’s the relationships we build and the people whom we trust that give us the courage to take risks and make ourselves better.” 
         <br>
         <br>
         <div class="img" style="margin: 3px 5px 7px 0px; float: left;">
          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780071637060.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9780071637060sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Never Fly Solo"></a>
         </div> By being willing to say, “I don’t know,” or “I messed up,” we create a transparency that will attract others to us and “create the type of environment where people won’t be afraid to make mistakes. They will also be more likely to check your six as well.” 
         <br>
         <br>Additionally, we have to keep our “radar sweeping for a wingman, coworker, or peer who may be experiencing a challenging time in her life. Don’t let her get isolated.” Be supportive and find her some help if necessary.” It is the worker that keeps to themselves—trying to fly solo—that check out, become unmotivated, complacent and careless. “Never feeling invested in the company’s mission, they do the minimum, and everyone suffers.” 
         <br>
         <br>In today’s environment, communication, feedback, and mutual support are critical Waldo says because: 
         <ul>
          <li>Human beings make mistakes.</li> 
          <li>We each have a limited perspective.</li> 
          <li>We operate in stressful environments that lead to tunnel vision and task saturation.</li> 
          <li>Most professionals undervalue communication and teamwork.</li> 
          <li>Faulty communication can kill a mission as well as a relationship.</li> 
          <li>Errors increase when there is no definable set of teamwork standards and skills.</li> 
         </ul> “An effective check-six environment frees up communication and removes barriers to growth, so that all members of the team feel empowered to speak up and ask questions.” It also builds team confidence. 
         <br>
         <br>We all need wingmen and

         </div> Gratitude is a way of investing ourselves in others. A particularly overlooked aspect of the art of gratitude is the habit of noticing. When we notice others and show our appreciation, it pays huge dividends. Additionally, by noticing others we become more attuned to life’s vitality, intensity and diversity. 
         <br>
         <br>I related the following story from the book 
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/6750-4.html"><i>Growing the Distance</i></a>, a few years ago, but it bears repeating: 
         <blockquote>
          Arden Barker had planted a 50-acre field of wheat that was now golden-brown, very full, and ready for harvest. It was a sight to touch the heart of any farmer. When his Uncle Harry came to visit, Arden proudly took him out to look at the field of wheat. Harry looked around, put his hand over his eyes to peer into the distance, and fixed his gaze on a boulder that had been too large to move in the middle of the field. “Is that a stone on the hill?” he asked. He said nothing about the field of wheat. Arden was crushed by his lack of enthusiasm. 
          <br>
          <br>The Uncle Harry incident became the subject of discussion at many Barker family dinners thereafter. A few years later, their daughter, Brenda, had just finished cutting and trimming the family’s huge lawn. Arden came home and surveyed her work from the kitchen window. “You missed a patch under the trees,” he pointed out. Brenda came over to him, put one arm around his waist, and her other hand over her eyes to peer off into the distance and asked, “Is that a stone on the hill?”
         </blockquote> Too often leaders, managers and parents think that it is crucial to their role to point out where people could improve—to be critical. Certainly, there is a time for that, but it happens all too often. Effective leaders will look for the positive and show gratitude and appreciation for it. People often look to others for direction and support and if it is not forthcoming it can kill the spirit and impede growth.

          <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781595552747.html"><img src="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/images/new/9781595552747sm.jpg" width="80" height="120" border="0" alt="Leadership"></a>
         </div>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781595552747.html"><i>Derailed</i></a> is about the traps you and I can fall into. Sometimes they are the result of the sense of entitlement that leaders can fall prey to. Sometimes they are the result of thinking and behavior that has worked (we think) in the past, so why change it now. Sometimes they are the overuse of a strength that we have yet to discipline. Sometimes we don’t even have a clue and so we get derailed and go around blaming others and asking “Why me?” 
         <br>
         <br>It can happen to anyone. And it is something we have to constantly be sensitive to because these traps are character issues that can disqualify us from leadership. Author Tim Irwin writes, “No matter how brilliant, charming, strategic, or commanding in presence a leader is, the consequences of a failed character are extraordinarily disabling and will bring down even the strongest among us. Similarly, if our character is inadequate, eventually we will miss the warning signals and slam into a parked freight train.” 
         <br>
         <br>To illuminate the impact and nature of derailment, Irwin profiles six leaders that either through arrogance, lack of self-awareness, a sense of entitlement, greed, self-discipline, or a combination of any or all, derailed. Derailment is a process. Irwin suggests that there are 
         <b>five stages</b>: a failure of self-/other-awareness, hubris, missed early warning signals, rationalizing and finally derailment. A lack of self-awareness is the foundation of all derailments. 
         <br>
         <br>These are all issues of character. And stressful times only make us more of who we already are. Authenticity, self-management, humility and courage are dimensions of character that when properly developed, help us to avoid derailment. We can only be as good a leader as the character we possess. 
         <br>
         <br>Derailment is not inevitable, but without attention to development, it is probable. He writes, “Derailment is especially rooted in the failure to prepare, to grow personally and professionally, and to develop the qualities needed to stay on track…. Attention to our development means we must be constantly alert and self-aware and have a lifelong commitment to learn, to grow, and to prepare.” 
         <br>
         <br>To combat derailment 
         <b>you need to adapt five habits</b> says Irwin. First, you need to develop a habit of 
         <b>openness</b>. “Openness to feedback reflects our interest in being a learning, growing person.” 
         <br>
         <br>Second is the habit of 
         <b>self-/other-awareness</b>. “It is critical that we regularly tune into how others see us.” When we find a big difference, we have a blind spot that needs to be addressed. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <table align="right" width="200" bgcolor="#FFF8DF" cellpadding="10">
          <tbody>
           <tr>
            <td><font face="arial" size="2" color="#336699">"We are all put to the test, but it never comes in the form or the point we would prefer, does it?"<br></font>
             <div align="right">
              <font face="arial" size="2" color="#336699">~Anthony Hopkins, <i>The Edge</i></font>
             </div></td>
           </tr>
          </tbody>
         </table> The third habit is to cultivate personal 
         <b>early warning systems</b> that can tell us when we are at risk of derailment. “The key is to monitor ourselves and to pay attention to our own signals or feedback from others. Exerting control over stress means that we do whatever is necessary to lower the stress level to one at which our performance is not compromised.” 
         <br>
         <br>We also need to develop a habit of 
         <b>accountability</b>. “The leaders most susceptible to derailment refuse to have their opinions, decision, and actions questioned…. Accountability means that, even when we are not required to answer to others because of our position or corporate policy or law, we intentionally place ourselves in a relationship with someone who tests our motives and our actions.” 
         <br>
         <br>Finally, is to develop the habit of 
         <b>resiliency</b>. “Resiliency is the ability not only to bounce back from adversity but also to grow from it.” A clear sense of purpose widens our perspective and helps us to become more resilient. 
         <br>
         <br>Sometimes we need a wake-up call to finally deal with our own issues. But we can learn vicariously. And that’s the best way to learn if we have the discipline. Tim Irwin’s book is a great place to begin. A guide for asking the hard questions.

         </div>There is no evidence to suggest that any species of animals other than humans come pre-packaged with a set of mechanisms for any kind of meaningful self-awareness—to ask 
         <i>what</i> and 
         <i>why</i>. The degree to which we develop and use that capacity, in a constructive way, will largely determine our success in life. 
         <br>
         <br>Self-awareness is where leadership development begins. Self-management and authenticity flow from self-awareness. Self-awareness can be divided into four parts: what is known to us and others, what is known to others but not by us, what we know and others don’t and what we don’t know and others don’t either. Plumbing the depths of self-awareness takes time and more intensive tactics. However, our biggest gain in self-improvement can be had by finding out what others know that we don’t. And they know more than we think. 
         <br>
         <br>Here are twelve keys to greater self-awareness: 
         <ol>
          <li>Stop blaming others for your choices. It’s you.</li> 
          <li>Take a personality assessment to help you gain some perspective.</li> 
          <li>Get feedback from as many significant people in your life as you can. This can be uncomfortable for both you and them, but it is the fastest method for gaining a better picture of yourself. (Make them feel safe. It's a big, unknown risk for <i>them</i>!)</li> 
          <li>Get a coach or mentor. They don't have to know more than you. They just have to see you in action and help you to be a better you. You're not as hard to figure out (complicated) as you would like to think.</li> 
          <li>Understand that your biggest irritations look a lot like you.</li> 
          <li>Look beneath your behavior to reveal your assumptions and filters. They dictate how you see yourself and others and impact how you relate to them.</li> 
          <li>Look at your roadblocks. Learn to separate facts from your interpretations of them.</li> 
          <li>Analyze your interactions. A lot of negative interactions signal a selfish approach to life.</li> 
          <li>Reflect <i>daily</i> on your behavior. Ask questions like: How do I handle difficulties? What do I think or do when I don’t get my own way? How adaptive am I? Can I control my emotions? Do I tend to say what I’m thinking when I’m thinking it? Do I judge other people and create conflict? How do others relate to me?</li> 
          <li>Organize your thoughts in a journal. It is one of the best ways to capture what is going on around you and inside you. Make a note of the causal remarks people make about you.</li> 
          <li>Read books and go to seminars that help you rethink your assumptions and address your problem areas and blind spots.</li> 
          <li>Be careful what you say. Words mean a lot. Your language reflects your thinking and attitudes.</li> 
         </ol> Your thinking and the behavior that flows from that has brought you to where you are now. You are in control of developing the thinking and behavior that will take you where you want to go. Self–awareness is difficult. We don’t always like to admit things about ourselves because we don’t like the guilt associated with not doing what we know we should. But admit we must if we are to grow. Ask yourself, “In light of where I come from, what do I need to know about myself?” 
         <br>
         <br>Warren Bennis wrote, “It is one of the paradoxes of life that good leaders rise to the top in spite of their weaknesses, while bad leaders rise because of their weakness….We are our own raw material. Only when we know what we are made of and what we want to make of it can we begin our lives—and we must do it despite an unwitting conspiracy of people and events against us.” It is a lifelong and rewarding journey.

         </div>The Parthenon, completed in 432 BC, is one of the world's greatest cultural monuments. The Doric temple was famously designed to counteract the optical illusions created by looking at something so large. To the observer, the columns look perfectly straight and perpendicular, and the steps appear to be horizontally level. This illusion is only possible by exacting architectural corrections. 
         <br>
         <br>To account for what the eye sees, every column, instead of being a straight line from base to neck, are actually curved on a slight arc having a gentle swell in the middle or 
         <i>entasis</i>. In addition, the corner columns are slightly larger in diameter than the others and are placed closer to the adjacent column than the distance between each of the other columns. This is due to the fact that the more well-lighted an object is, the smaller it will appear and thus a little further apart than the columns set against the darker background of the building wall.
         <br>
         <div class="img" style="margin: 7px 0px 2px 5px; float: right;">
          <img src="http://leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/images/Acropolis.jpg" width="132" height="300" border="0" alt="Parthenon">
         </div> 
         <br>As the columns rise they are angled towards the center of the temple. Remarkably, the base upon which they rest is curved upwards towards the center so as to make it look horizontally level from a distance. To offset the curvature of the base, the lower drums of the columns are made higher on one side than on the other. Without this correction the columns would lean in opposite directions. 
         <br>
         <br>All of the deviations from the vertical and the horizontal made to enhance building's appearance required exacting mathematical calculations. The lines and angles of this geometric structure have been softened into curves so perfectly that they are imperceptible to the observer's eye and harmoniously create the builders vision. Excellence. 
         <br>
         <br>Dan Meyer relates the story of an elderly man who returned every few years to the city of Athens for most of his adult life. Each time he would climb to the top of the Acropolis, take a seat on one of its ancient stones and spend an hour or two letting his eyes wander over the massive plateau, reflecting on the soaring columns, and the perfect proportions of the Parthenon. When asked to explain the reason for his habitual behavior, the elderly gentleman’s eyes crinkled as he smiled: 
         <b>“I do this because it keeps my standards high.”</b> 
         <br>
         <br>Where do you go for inspiration? Where do your values come from? Where do you go to 
         <i>revitalize</i> your standards?

         <h2 class="title">Emotional Intelligence: Self-Awareness</h2> Without self-awareness leadership becomes just another exercise in ego gratification. Self-awareness allows for self-discipline and control of the ego. Without it the ego runs amok looking after itself and only incidentally in the service of others if the needs of both happen to align. 
         <br>
         <br>Self-awareness is the ability to see when an emotion or a perception is influencing your thinking and behavior and, if necessary, do something about it. Gaining control over the state of your mind will pay big dividends in terms of your leadership effectiveness. It is the blind spot of leadership. Being able to step back and see both the positive and negative aspects about yourself, to see how you affect others, and to see how you are behaving in 
         <i>real-time</i>, is critical to your success as a leader. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <a href="http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9780974320625.html"><i>Emotional Intelligence 2.0</i></a> offers some good strategies to develop your self-awareness as part of an overall EQ skill development program. Self-awareness is a bigger problem than one might think. The book reports that “only 36 percent of the people tested were able to accurately identify their emotions as they happen. This means that two thirds of us are typically controlled by our emotions and are not yet skilled at spotting them and using them to our benefit.” 
         <br>
         <br>A proper and healthy self-awareness facilitates an essential other-awareness that is vital to good leadership. You can not manage the behaviors of others without first getting a handle on your own.

         </div>On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and then “Buzz” Aldrin first stepped on to the surface of the moon. Most of the population in the U.S. alive today have no recollection of that event. Yet it is an event that continues to shape the world we live in today. Like many of the great achievements of the past, we don’t and probably can’t fully grasp the effort – problems, ingenuity, perseverance and sense of humor – that went into making the landing on the moon a reality. 
         <br>
         <br>The Apollo 11 mission was a success in large part because it was supported by everyone. Not just 
         <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/40th/index.html" title="NASA 40th" target="_blank">NASA</a>, but congress and the American people. It was truly a national project. It taught us to work through our unknowns and have faith in our ability to learn and grow. 
         <br>
         <br>President John F. Kennedy told an 
         <a href="http://www.thespacerace.com/documents/jfkspeech2.php" title="JFK Speech" target="_blank">audience at Rice University</a> on September 12, 1962: 
         <blockquote>
          We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, 
          <b>not because they are easy, but because they are hard</b>, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
         </blockquote> True accomplishments come from doing the hard thing and not resting on the easy things. Raise your expectations. Don’t rob yourself of your potential future. Strive to do the hard things.

In a world haunted by the relative, finding anchors for your life is not as readily available as it should be. Beginning life with a relative mindset is a recipe for disaster. When good advice comes along it is important to take notice of it and see how it fits in with your values and the outcomes you want for yourself.

         <br>If you are fortunate enough to find a good mentor to aid you, it’s important to take them seriously if you want to get the full benefit. 
         <blockquote>
          Once you find a mentor, it’s essential that you show respect and never become a “Yeah, but.” If your mentor tells you your hair is too long and needs to be cut, do it. Don’t ever say, “Yeah, but I had it short and that didn’t help.” Whatever your mentor suggests, do it and do it immediately if you want him or her to continue to help you. It’s one thing to do what your mentor suggests and report back how it went and quite another to question the advice without trying it. You won’t la
