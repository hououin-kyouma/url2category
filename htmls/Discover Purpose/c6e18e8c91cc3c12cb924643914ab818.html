             <div class="rawHTML" style="margin-top:10px;">

              <p><em>"There was an unmistakable crack of a firearm...then another and another. Screams echoed throughout the store. Customers and employees seeking cover and darting for the exits. He's got a gun!!! one hollers, followed by more screams and shots..."</em> </p> 
              <p>Unfortunately, this scene is playing out in more and more businesses, government agencies, and in public spaces around the country. With economic turmoil shattering lives, we can only expect these crises to grow and pose an ever-increasing challenge for leaders. </p> 
              <p>The chaos of the times seems to present a new disaster every week, plunging leaders who may be top-notch performers under normal operations into a world of chaos and expectations — situations they are both unequipped to handle and also prone to make well-meaning yet disastrous decisions in the heat of the moment. </p> 
              <p>Leadership in a crisis situation is very different from leadership in a time of normal conditions. On the surface, the Five Practices may not seem to apply to a world turned upside down. But based on my teaching experience, all leaders in government and industry would find the tools useful and provide the foundation for responding to and recovering from any crisis. </p> 
              <p>The organizational operating models that provide the baseline for a smooth-running enterprise during normal times evaporate during a crisis, throwing the leadership into a morass of uncertainty and chaos. But the chaos can be managed successfully if its impacts are understood.</p> 
              <ol> 
               <li>Tension and stress: In any crisis, leaders are thrust into a stressful and tense environment that puts them under enormous psychological, mental, and physical strain. Even the most minor decision made under these circumstances can result in catastrophic impacts. </li> 
               <li>Speed: Everything may initially happen at warp speed, giving little time for thoughtful consideration or consultation. In a crisis, worlds collide and time is the first victim. </li> 
               <li>Personnel: The right people may not be available to respond to the crisis, resulting in untrained and inexperienced leaders being called upon to step into the chaos. Without the right people the organization will stumble in normal times, but during a crisis the problems are accentuated exponentially. </li> 
               <li>Organization: Businesses and governments are not necessarily organized to handle crisis. In fact, the organizational hierarchy may be a hindrance to response and recovery. The flexibility to adapt the organization to the situation is critical to success. </li> 
               <li>Stakeholders: The list of stakeholders will rapidly expand, bringing in to play new channels of communication, new expectations, and new players--all simultaneously. Suppliers, regulators, families, customers, hospitals, law enforcement will all require a leaders time and interaction. </li> 
               <li>Communication: The normal channels of communication may not be operative or may be overloaded, requiring new channels and protocols that must be quickly mastered. </li> 
               <li>Media: The leader in crisis has the media spotlight suddenly amplified, all waiting to report and find fault. </li> 
               <li>Simplicity: Simplicity is the key in a crisis. Simplicity ultimately wins. The more complex a leader makes a solution in a crisis the less likely success will be the end result. </li> 
              </ol> 
              <p>Understanding the impact a crisis has on the leader is critical to stepping up to the podium as an instructor or facilitator. In teaching crisis leadership in over 100 seminars and workshops, the following lessons can help you prepare:</p> 
              <ol> 
               <li>Experiential: Provide your audience with an example of a crisis that is as real as possible, addressing as many of the above impacts as appropriate. For example, text prepared messages to your audience during the workshop; use relevant, practical organization applications that the audience can identify with, have a roving reporter stress the audience with uncomfortable questions and inquisitions. I have even hit plastic golf balls into the audience to add a little tension and stress to the workshop. Make the environment of the session as real as possible. If you are not going to make it real, they can read a book and not get the leadership crisis experience. </li> 
               <li>Do your homework: Each organization has different stress points and leadership expectations. What creates a crisis in the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is very different from a large multinational conglomerate. Teaching leadership in crisis without understanding the organization will certainly undermine the effectiveness of the workshop. </li> 
               <li>Audio Visuals: Use as many audio visual tools as practical. They not only educate and entertain, but also can be used to control an audience. There are any number of products available on the internet. I have never had a problem finding the right clip to demonstrate a point. </li> 
               <li>Case studies: Actual events that make the point and are relevant to the organization in training are invaluable. In workshops for the food safety community, for example, I draw upon cases from various incidents in food contamination; for public utilities, ice storms and hurricanes; for major corporations, commodity futures exposure. </li> 
              </ol> 
              <p>Applying the lessons of <em>The Leadership Challenge</em> to a crisis becomes a matter of common sense. As a brief demonstration of the application of the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® to crisis leadership, I offer the following:</p> 
              <p>Model the Way: In my experience as a leader in business and the military, the quickest way to lose your leadership credentials is to not demonstrate balance in a crisis. Instead of calmly addressing a crisis at hand, the inept crisis leader will lose control of his/her actions, temper, emotions, or awareness. In the Navy we call it "losing the bubble"; not being aware of the tactical situation at sea can cost lives. Demonstrate balanced leadership.</p> 
              <p>Inspire a Shared Vision: It is critical in a crisis that we all share the same goal. We may have different reasons for the goal but we have the goal in common. For example, the obvious goal is to return to normalcy. To employees this means ensuring that their job survives, while an executive worries about stopping the revenue loss. Return to normalcy.</p> 
              <p>Challenge the Process: The organizational processes are stressed in any crisis and may become dysfunctional. A leader in crisis must have the flexibility to adapt to the situation, regardless of the inherent processes of the organization. Flexibility to adapt.</p> 
              <p>Enable Others to Act: In a crisis, much more than in normal operations, effective partnerships are critical to the success. Simply put, partnerships save lives.</p> 
              <p>Encourage the Heart: Taking care of the response staff is not much different in a crisis as in normal operating situations. What is different is the stress the team is under and how fast this can change. A leader in crisis needs to be more aware of the physical, psychological, and mental condition of the team. An operative that has been controlling an evacuation for 12 hours straight may need time out to regroup. The leader must be aware and respond. </p> 
              <p>It is critical for a leader to be aware as the environment becomes dysfunctional or begins to stabilize. Although the general rules for leading in a crisis are different, they are not outside the parameters of The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. Today, our world is routinely in crisis mode. And even though one leadership style does not fit all, when it comes to dealing with a crisis situation, we are fortunate to have a guide like <em>The Leadership Challenge</em> to serve as the foundation of organizational crisis response and recovery. </p>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> To achieve extraordinary results, leaders must recognize the input and energy that come from others as they facilitate continuous improvement, change, and collaboration. One school of thought that has emerged in recent decades as a way in which leaders can unite that energy to build and sustain high-performing teams is Human Systems Theory.<br> <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Untitled.png" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;"><br> A human system, as defined by <a href="http://www.crrglobal.com" target="_blank">CRR Global</a>
               <www.crrglobal.com>
                , one of the leaders of systems-based approaches to leadership, is when two or more people come together through dependency with a common purpose and identity. This entity is recognized as having power, energy, and knowledge. And when a fused team taps into those attributes answers show up, deep respect for input from others exists, change is welcomed, and unity is evident—even in times of conflict. This “human system” team is leadership in action.
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> Over the years, research from such systems-theory pioneers as Peter Senge has provided evidence that a move away from top-down or lead-from-the-front leadership is more and more being superseded by this type of relationship-based approach in which decisions coming from a collective wisdom contribute to a strong ‘team entity’. And it is this systems-based state that closely aligns with The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. With the model’s focus on self-leadership, those who embrace The Leadership Challenge and harness the energy and knowledge of the collective have the ability to (in the words of Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner) “transform values into action, visions into reality, obstacles into opportunities, separateness into solidarity, and risk into rewards”. 
                <br> 
                <br> Exploring this alignment, here are some thoughts on how a systems-theory approach to working with teams can complement and/or enhance each of The Five Practices: 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <strong>Model the Way</strong> 
                <br> Values are at the core of this first Practice as it challenges leaders to have clarity on ‘what matters most’ to them. However, leaders never stand nor achieve alone. Shared values bring alignment, appreciation, transparency, mutual understanding, and clarity. And working with a team as a human system to identify and voice its values would assist greatly here. 
                <br> 
                <br> Once a system has emerged (e.g., a project or operational team, a department, a committee), its strength lies in its identity which comes from every voice within the system—sharing, caring, respecting, and allowing for individual difference. Like the Practice of Model the Way, values also are at the core of this formation process. A significant benefit of a systems-based approach is its focus on continuous improvement. As the team progresses toward new challenges, new ‘inner compasses’ (new values) will no doubt emerge and so would the dialogue around their importance. A system’s intra-dependency would simply not allow this to happen any other way. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <strong>Inspire a Shared Vision</strong> 
                <br> When leaders perceive a changing direction, one that has potential for bringing greater hope to the organization and to people, they willingly paint a picture of the exciting and ennobling future. They effectively enlist others in a common vision by integrating imagery and metaphor in telling the ideal story, as they see it. Leaders also recognize that they themselves only know what they know, and when others are invited into the picture, it may well expand their original vision with additional input and creativity. 
                <br> 
                <br> Engagement for growth and change is the very essence of systems work. A system is always in an emergent state, becoming greater than its former state as it invites in each voice and perspective, allowing fresh input to be received within the context of ‘what matters most’. A human-systems team will even recognize conflict as an opportunity for development. Competition gives way to the collective wisdom of all, which will creatively extend a leader’s vision, if and when relevant. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <strong>Challenge the Process</strong> 
                <br> When an exemplary leader facilitates the organization’s growth toward a new destination, there’s bound to be many learning opportunities and a need for innovative trial and error. Trust-based relationships and collaboration are essential to fulfill the promise of this Practice. After all, the team has never been there before. Mistakes will no doubt be made. This can bring about burnout, hesitancy, complacency, and even risk-aversion for individuals on the team. 
                <br> 
                <br> Taking a systems approach to Challenge the Process can help leaders understand that a “human-system” team simply cannot exist without a focus on growth and regeneration. It achieves this with synergetic energy, ensuring the total sum is greater than its parts: the team focus is stronger and deeper than that of the individuals within the team. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <strong>Enable Others to Act</strong> 
                <br> This fourth leadership Practice focuses on developing individual competence, confidence, and trust. Exemplary leaders foster collaboration and strengthen each team members’ self-determination and, as a result, the contributions of all individuals grow—sometimes exponentially equipping them for future challenges and preparing them to bring value to joint efforts. 
                <br> 
                <br> When two or more people come together through dependency, with a common purpose and identity, empowering others is also what this human system is all about. When one voice speaks the system will automatically adjust to integrate its message without question, ensuring all inputs contribute to enabling the future. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <strong>Encourage the Heart</strong> 
                <br> As practitioners of The Leadership Challenge®, when we recognize individual excellence and create a strong spirit of community, balanced and respectful encouragement exists that further propels our collective efforts into action. Celebrations and acts of positive recognition strengthen the bond of teamwork and trust, and reinforce the value that it is only the best and most innovative that the team seeks. It could be suggested that leaders engaged in this Practice think of encouragement as synonymous with water for a marathon. When the going gets tough, people get tired, worried and often feel stretched and stressed; at such times, recognizing their efforts with that one little extra drop of ‘water’ can send the engine of willing efficiency back into action. 
                <br> 
                <br> Similarly, a human system is fueled by the excitement of progress, the ability to self-correct and the ownership of results. It is driven by a strong conviction about the path it walks and the progress it makes. At every moment, it is self-encouraging and mutually-assisting. The validation and encouragement that keeps the system going is simply embedded in its DNA. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <strong>Summary</strong> 
                <br> Over the years, there have been a number of well-founded leadership models walking alongside The Five Practices, complementing and enhancing the effectiveness of The Leadership Challenge’s powerful model. I have found that incorporating systems-based principles into my leadership development work can make a profound difference in increasing engagement, commitment, and outcomes. By their very nature, human systems are intelligent, creative, and generative. And working with this framework in mind, I’m confident we all can help teams much more successfully address difficult situations with dignity and respect, transform values into action with cohesion, and turn separateness into solidarity with sustained collaboration.

                , I encourage you to see it immediately. And, if you’ve seen it once…see it again! On a flight from Tokyo to LA recently, I watched it for a third time and was again struck by how remarkable this movie is: the real-life story of three inspiring black women who were instrumental in advancing the NASA space program and both racial and gender equality—in 1961, Hampton, VA. It’s rich with great lessons in leadership and I was especially struck by how many of the 30 behaviors of the LPI®: The Leadership Practices Inventory® I could see demonstrated by the film’s characters. 
                <br> 
                <br> Take Dorothy Vaughan, my favorite leading lady played by Octavia Spencer. In every way, she exemplified the definition of leadership and how it differs from management. Although she was one among many women working in the "Colored Computers" department—a peer with no title of supervisor—it was evident that she had established credibility among her co-workers and was clearly seen as a leader. As a visionary, she saw and understood the ramifications of the new IBM computer that had just arrived: it could eliminate her job and those of the other women as well. So, she 
                <em>led by example</em>. She challenged herself to learn FORTRAN, the computer coding program at that time, and how to operate the new computer. She then challenged the others and showed how their interests could be realized by 
                <em>enlisting in a common vision</em>. The result, of course, was not only did they keep their jobs but, when the time came, they were fully prepared to step up and run the machines when others were not. Ultimately, they ended up training other NASA employees. And while Dorothy was finally recognized for her leadership and promoted to supervisor, she was an amazing leader long before that ever happened. 
                <br> 
                <br> Janelle Monáe portrays Mary Jackson, a fearless woman working on the Mercury 7. With dreams of being a NASA engineer, she takes a risk to 
                <em>challenge the status quo</em> to make it happen. In order to be accepted into NASA's Engineer Training Program, education requirements, including Advance Exception Credits, had to be completed at the University of Virginia or the Hampton High School. As segregation was the law-of-the-land throughout the State of Virginia, including in all of its public institutions, Mary had a fight on her hands. Undeterred by the notion of segregation, in one of her most outstanding scenes she is before a court judge ready to persuade him to allow her to attend night school at the Hampton High School. She has done her research on the judge and begins by praising his many "firsts": the first in his family to enlist in the armed forces (Navy), the first to attend college (George Mason), and the first state judge recommissioned by three governors. She 
                <em>appeals to him with the noble idea</em> of being the first again by saying, "Of all the cases you are going to hear today, which one is going to matter 100 years from now? Which one is going to make you the first?" It is a terrific scene showing how we all have the capacity to expand our influence even though we may not have any “official” control or authority to do so. 
                <br> 
                <br> Taraji P. Henson plays the lead role of Katherine Goble Johnson, a brilliant mathematician who assisted with the trajectories of the Mercury Atlas and with John Glenn's Friendship 7 launch and landing codes. My favorite scene is when she returns from using the “Colored Ladies Room”, a good half mile from her work location that she must walk/run to in a dress and heels, even in rain. She’s confronted by her boss Al Harrison (played by Kevin Costner) who asks where she "disappears to every day." With courage and honesty she speaks up, making clear the facts about the separate-but-equal policies and racism that exist at NASA. Whether unaware of the situation or uncaring up to this point, Harrison is moved by her argument to take an active role in dismantling the “coloreds only” bathroom sign and eliminating the separate coffee pot. Katherine’s actions exemplified how you can "lead up" to create change when you have built credibility and influence through your character and work ethic. 
                <br> 
                <br> All three of these “exemplary leaders” played a critical part in successfully helping NASA beat the Russians into space. They were instrumental in getting Friendship 7 launched and John Glenn safely home after three successful orbits. And each went on to lead extraordinary lives, continuing to demonstrate all the best attributes of great leaders:

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <strong>Q: What are some of the main challenges for modern-day leaders?</strong> <br> <br> A: Challenge is the defining context for leadership. For over three decades, Barry Posner and I having been asking people to tell us about their personal-best leadership experiences, and the stories are always about dealing with adversity and hardship, doing something no one had ever done before, turning around a losing operation, starting something from scratch, breaking away from tradition, installing untested processes, or struggling with poorly performing units. They were not about maintaining the status quo, but rather about changing the business-as-usual environment. This is a critical lesson to keep in mind, because no one ever got anything extraordinary done without initiating and accepting a challenge. Challenge, it turns out, is the crucible for greatness. Exemplary leaders view challenge as opportunities to excel. <br> <br> With that perspective in mind, leaders today will be dealing with a variety of challenges that include the rise of emerging markets that are shifting the centers of commerce, rapid technological advancements that are enabling connectivity globally, climate changes that will impact water sources, agriculture production, and sea levels, aging populations that are putting pressure on social support systems in many countries and the large number of unemployed or underemployed young people in others. <br> <br> In our work in leadership development, there is a major concern about the lack of a sufficient number of trained leaders to move into more senior roles. Organizations can’t keep up with the demand for more and better leaders, and young people don’t have enough opportunities to learn to lead. For example, in one study, 90 per cent of employers want to see leadership development opportunities as part of every student’s educational experience, but fewer than 6 per cent of universities have formal leadership development programs. Another issue is the low levels of trust in leaders globally, in both the private and public sectors. Trust started falling precipitously during the recession that began in 2008, and while it has started to improve, trust in leaders is still at a very low level in most countries around the world. That is a major challenge to leaders because without people’s trust one cannot lead effectively. <p><em><br> Adapted from an interview with Jim Kouzes, What Makes a Good Leader?, published in Gulf Business, the premier business monthly reaching leaders across the Middle East, including UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia. </em><br> <em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p><strong><img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Jim_Pic%20TLC%20website.jpg" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 124px; height: 186px;"><br> Jim Kouzes</strong> is the Dean’s Executive Fellow of Leadership, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> If you run in the same types of circles that I do, you can't go an hour without thinking about, hearing about, or being asked about culture. Everyone is talking about what programs they are implementing, how they are redesigning their organizational structure, even adding free beer to the lunch room (I'm not kidding!) But none of these exercises matter when you miss the first and most critical element of a culture. <br> <br> At the heart of every strong culture there is a set of guiding principles that everyone “gets”—at a soul level. It drives what people will pursue and how they will treat each other and your clients. No matter the cost, the group will not violate its principles because the pain of living outside of its values is more hurtful than any other loss. In the 6th edition of <em>The Leadership Challenge</em>, Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner write that their "studies have shown that shared values foster heightened levels of motivation and intense feelings of personal effectiveness. They promote pride, high levels of company loyalty (lower turnover), and teamwork, and reduce levels of job stress and tension." Sounds like all the things that happen when you have a great culture, right? <br> <br> This is probably something that is intuitive to you. But the real question is how did those teams get so aligned to begin with? We may get that a strong culture is based on shared ideals, but have no idea where to start to build those ideals. So, how do we get that done? <br> <br> Here's the hardest, simple answer to that question: it starts with you. <br> <br> In every strong culture we admire, there was that one person who had the courage to figure out what they stand for and to share it, openly through word and deed, and never waiver. That person develops TRUST and others begin to WANT to be associated with that person because that person's steadfastness is a reflection on THEM. They are wise with their words, attention and time to ensure that they all align with who they espouse to be. They make it safe for others to share their values too, and they LISTEN and CARE about what they hear. Only then can the organization and its members develop a language of its own and develop the culture it wants. <br> <br> So, we can create all the culture teams and programs that we want, and they may land or not. But you cannot create anything lasting without first addressing the values of the organization by being clear about yours. And it just takes that one person to get started. Will it be you? <br> <br> <strong><img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Amanda%20Nelson.jpg" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 120px; height: 120px;"><br> Amanda Nelson,</strong> MBA, SPHR, SHRM-SCP, is a Certified Master-in-Training of The Leadership Challenge and currently Director of Human Resources at Lerch Bates, Inc. where she oversees global HR functions, including culture development, succession planning, and performance management.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> An ancient Chinese proverb that says, “The longest journey begins with a single step” is one that guides our work as facilitators in our Open Enrollment Workshops in Shanghai. Whether working with individual leaders in The Leadership Challenge® Workshop or in a Facilitator Training with those learning to become facilitators themselves, we often begin the journey by asking participants to share stories about The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. Here are four of our favorites that stand out as demonstrating important lessons about leadership. <br> <br> <strong>Story One: Inspire a Shared Vision</strong> <br> Two employees of Alibaba, the biggest internet and intranet company in China, shared a story of the company’s Founder and CEO, Jack Ma. Fifteen years ago he had a vision to “Make business easy in the world” and to “Enable everyone to pay for goods and services by using technology.” Today, even in China’s most rural villages, you will see farmers and laborers selling their products, ordering goods, and making transactions by just clicking their smartphone. And right now, Jack Ma’s vision is only getting bigger. He not only connects sellers and buyers online, making payments by Alipay, he also built the intranet logistic system called Cai Niao (New Bird), which impacts health care, hospital payments, insurance, and many other areas. Jack Ma’s vision for Alibaba has transformed the way millions of Chinese and people worldwide go about their day. <br> <br> <strong>Story Two: Model the Way</strong> <br> Recent class participant Mandy Qin introduced the notion of “intent vs impact”—the concept of what we intend to do versus how it is received by our teams—that created a spirited discussion about how we as leaders are always on stage. The class spoke passionately about how real this concept is for leaders. They shared that even the best intentions of the best leaders occasionally have an adverse impact. One example comes from my own coaching experience working with a national sales and marketing director. After he completed the LPI® assessment and received his personalized report he was shocked with the results. He had <em>intended</em> to be an exemplary leader but his peers and others clearly interpreted his behaviors differently. They did not often see this leader “walking the talk” and “showing respect and integrity”—all of which resulted in conflicts across functions. <br> <br> <strong>Story Three: Enable Others to Act</strong> <br> Colin Pine had just graduated from law school in New York when he saw an unusual classified ad in the <em>New York Times</em> for a translator for the NBA who spoke Mandarin. He researched the ad and soon learned that it was Yao Ming, China’s most famous basketball player, who needed help navigating language and life in the U.S. Colin took the job as Yao’s English teacher and translator, but with one major condition: he would only serve for a few years. By then, he announced, Yao would be equipped to speak and read English well on his own. His decision to ultimately work himself out of the job shows the power of Enable Others to Act. During the time that they worked together, Colin and Yao built a high-trust relationship. And as Colin gave his power away, he ultimately strengthened Yao’s ability to navigate the rigors of NBA life on his own. <br> <br> Yao retired after eight seasons in the NBA. He now speaks and reads English thanks to the leadership of Colin Pine. <br> <br> <strong>Story Four: – Challenge the Process</strong> <br> In a luncheon speech recently, Shao Bin Zhao, Director of Organization Development at Orient Scape, a company famous for urban landscape and environmental treatment, spoke about how some of the “old school” managers at his organization did not care much about employee well-being. Highlighting the fact that members of his organization had been working 12 hours-a-day, six days-a-week (yes, 72 hours a week!) to meet their goals, he described the emotional burden that this “command and control” style of leadership has had on the staff. It is not surprising to learn of the 33% turnover which the company is experiencing. <br> <br> Later, when he participated in our workshop he reflected on the burden employees were experiencing and committed to Challenge the Process by talking candidly about ways to make work enjoyable and meaningful—not just an endurance test. By the end of our four days together, he determined that his organization’s journey toward better, smarter, more enduring leadership would begin with the single step of bringing The Leadership Challenge® to Orient Scape’s leadership team. He will be the first seed of better leadership there. And we all wish him good luck! <br> <br> Storytelling is a powerful tool to use when facilitating a workshop for leaders and/or a training session for facilitators. When we want to engage others in implementing change initiatives, connect personally with fellow team members, convey important organizational or leadership lessons, or inspire followers to share our vision, stories are a much more effective means of communication (versus facts, charts, and PowerPoint slides). They can help bridge cultural and language divides, more clearly illustrate complex concepts, and make it much easier for people to remember and resonate with a shared emotion. <br> <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Connie%20Stephens2.jpg" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 125px; height: 90px;"><br> <strong>Qiu Hua (Connie) Stephens</strong> is a Certified Master-in-Training of The Leadership Challenge and founder of Shanghai-based HeadStart Consulting Inc. where she works with clients throughout Asia and the U.S. on leadership development, coaching, and organization development.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> The Practice of Model the Way urges leaders to set the example, to go first. Exemplary leaders, the research demonstrates, maintain respect and credibility for themselves and their organizations when they are vulnerable, open, and honest—especially when things go wrong. And examples abound of CEOs and other high-profile leaders who have both failed or excelled at delivering what former chairman and CEO of Medtronic Arthur Collins Jr. calls an “honest apology.” In his interview on Knowledge@Wharton’s SiriusXM, <strong><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/honest-apologies-can-help-leaders-organizations-rebound/?utm_source=kw_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=2017-08-01" target="_blank">How Honest Apologies Can Help Leaders Bounce Back</a></strong>, he discusses the power of an honest apology, why waiting to apologize can be so costly, the importance of taking personal responsibility—whether it was a mess you created or not—and much more.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <strong>Q:</strong> In my financial services organization, several of our managers/leaders have taken the LPI® Self assessment, administered by our HR Department and managed via the LPI Online portal. The LPI reports are used to create individual development plans that sometimes include further training workshops. Participants are aware that their individual reports will be reviewed by members of the HR/Talent Development team to provide guidance for one-to-one coaching, scheduling of any additional training, and also to report out to upper management on an individual’s overall progress and outcome of the training. Given that others will see their LPI report and may make judgements—rightly or wrongly—about an individual’s potential or performance, I wonder if our leaders are not trying to “game” the instrument. Whether consciously or subconsciously, are they reacting to the stress they feel about how the results will affect their development plans, career paths, or even employment prospects and inadvertently altering their responses? Are they approaching it as a “test” rather than answering honestly about the frequency with which they exhibit the 30 behaviors? <br> <br> <strong>A:</strong> Let me begin by establishing first and foremost that the purpose of the LPI is developmental. In some ways it doesn’t matter what the individual’s “scores” are, as much as it matters that the person is motivated to take action to become a better leader. The initial iteration of the LPI is not about good or bad, above or below average, but a baseline report that provides a foundation for suggesting areas in which the person could increase his or her frequency of behavior. This is from the normative perspective that the more frequently one engages in the 30 leadership behaviors (indeed, any one of them), the person will be more effective. While coaching advice for any one individual compared to another will vary, what doesn’t vary is the question “what can you do to become an even better leader in the future than you are today?” Because there aren’t any behaviors on the LPI that an individual cannot do, if he/she wanted to, thought it was important to do, remembered to do, felt more comfortable and skillful at doing, and so on. The LPI is not a test. <br> <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Barry%20Posner,%20headshot.jpg" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 125px; height: 137px;"><br> <strong> Barry Posner</strong>, Ph.D., is the Accolti Endowed Professor of Leadership at the Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University, where he served as Dean for 12 years.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/mastersgivebackedit_group%20photo.jpg" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 200px; height: 150px;"><br> One of the great traditions of the annual Leadership Challenge Forum is the chance for a few of us to facilitate a special Masters Give Back offering of The Leadership Challenge® Workshop. Each year it’s an opportunity to <strong>Model the Way</strong> as we strive toward the goal of “liberating the leader in everyone”—specifically a diverse group of non-profit leaders in and around the community in which we meet. This yearly workshop is a collaborative effort—with Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner, our colleagues at Wiley, Certified Masters, Certified Masters-in-Training, and Global Training Partners—that is often a highlight of the Forum experience for the people involved. And this year was no exception, with the themes of diversity and collaboration dominating our team’s experience as we gathered for Forum 2017 in San Diego. <br> <br> The facilitator team is diverse in its own right: different nationalities and backgrounds, all coming from different places across the globe. We had Evans Kerrigan from New Jersey, Amy Dunn from Connecticut, Connie Stevens from Shanghai, and Debbie Nicol who lives and works in Dubai but hails originally from Australia. And with different continents, widely varying time zones, and access to conflicting communication and document sharing technology, creative collaboration was key from the start of our planning process. In fact, the only “live” group meeting we were able to pull off in advance of meeting in San Diego was conducted exclusively via an international text app! Less than ideal, but the collaborative spirit and a good dose of humor made for a productive session despite the obstacles. Perhaps you could say we <strong>Challenged the Process! </strong><br> <br> The impact on the entire team was best described by Debbie Nicol when she said, “Diversity is like a vast tapestry, bestowing upon a wall or floor new colors and textures. With the sharing of facilitation techniques and approaches, my tapestry became bigger and brighter, and a lot more to pack in my bags as I spread the word of The Leadership Challenge across the seas.” Each one of us echoes that feeling (not necessarily as poetically) after a wonderful process of creating and delivering the program and learning from each other. <br> <br> We also had help from a diverse group of other collaborators. As part of our extended facilitating team family, a big shout out to San Diego-based co-founder of Integris Performance Advisors, Tracy O’Rourke, who tapped into her area network to raise awareness of this opportunity and was instrumental in engaging the group of non-profit leaders who attended. As the Global Training Partner sponsor of this years’ program, Integris also volunteered the time and talents of co-founder Brett Cooper (a great example of Inspire a Shared Vision) and Client Experience Director Samantha Kerrigan (a great example of GSD – otherwise known as Getting Stuff DONE!). Their collaboration was certainly one that <strong>Enabled (Us) Others to Act.</strong> <br> <br> Our 19 workshop participants represented great diversity as well, with leaders coming from a variety of organizations, including San Diego Zoo Global, Challenge Center, AIDS Service Foundation OC, Fred Finch Youth Center, GLA Foundation, National Defense Industrial Association, San Diego Humane Society, Boy Scouts, Bread of Life Rescue Mission, and San Diego Council on Literacy. Beginning with the LPI® and a review of all participants’ results, everyone engaged in a variety of exercises and small group discussions that brought each of The Five Practices to life—including the Paper Towers activity that helped demonstrate the Practice of <strong>Enable Others to Act.</strong> We also used an Awards Table packed with small dollar-store items that underscored one of the key commitments to <strong>Encourage the Heart:</strong> “Recognize contributions by showing appreciation for individual excellence.” Throughout the day participants called time out to select and present an award any time they felt moved to do so. <br> <br> A highlight for everyone was the opportunity to join a special Q &amp; A session over lunch with Jim and Barry that really enriched the experience for our workshop participants! They gained a deeper understanding about The Leadership Challenge and The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. Many thanks to the authors for their openness and generous sharing. <br> <br> And finally, at the end of the day each participant was asked to share two words that captured the essence of their experience and take-away insights. We heard things like “amazing experience”, “very inspiring”, “thought-provoking” and “meaningful feedback”. For John Damstra, local Boy Scouts Troop Leader, there was no hesitation. Quickly pointing to a chart on the wall, he declared, “That’s my takeaway!”’. The chart showing a simple structure to increase the impact of recognition read: 1) Link item with action, 2) What that showed us about you, 3) What that did for us. This best practice is one Debbie uses effectively to support people practicing recognition while in the workshop setting and can continue to be a valuable tool for them back on the job as well. In fact, John acknowledged that he could see how using these tips will help him double the impact of his efforts by reinforcing individual excellence while also building a spirit of community. <br> <br> Another participant, Regional VP of the Fred Finch Youth Center Ali Freedman, summed up her experience this way: “The amount of material covered in one day was remarkable. By changing our groups and having us engage with different small groups in different areas not only helped us get the most out of the diversity within the group, but it also helped us remember the different exercises and hold on to the salient points. I came away feeling my day was very well spent and I would continue to draw from the material and the process for a long time to come as I continue to progress as a leader.” <br> <br> In addition to the wonderful feeling of giving back to leaders who give so much in service to their communities, Amy and Evans also were honored to be able to give back to the Certified Master program. As Amy reflected, “As a Certified Master-in-Training in 2015, I was invited by Dan Schwab and Tom Pearce to participate in that year’s Masters Give Back workshop in San Francisco. It was an important and enriching experience on my journey of becoming a Certified Master and I was so pleased to have the opportunity to ‘pay it forward’ to Connie and Debbie this year. When Renee Harness (mentor to Debbie) and Tom Pearce (mentor to Connie) reached out to see if we could include them, Evans and I jumped at the chance to do so.” <br> <br> We all feel honored and privileged to be part of Masters Give Back program and learned not only from our fellow facilitators but also from the participants. Connie shared a Chinese saying, “Teaching benefits teachers as well as students”. This experience shows how true that saying is. <br> <br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>Qiu Hua (Connie) Stephens</strong> is a Certified Master-in-Training of The Leadership Challenge and founder of Shanghai-based HeadStart Consulting Inc. where she works with clients throughout Asia and the U.S. on leadership development, coaching, and organization development.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> The Leadership Challenge® Workshop is an amazing experience for so many people. Time spent with others making commitments as to how they will engage in the behaviors and practices of exemplary leadership really gets leaders fired-up about making substantive changes in their work and personal lives. You see the passion and purpose in participants’ eyes as they walk out of the workshop. And we, as facilitators and coaches, “hope” we have provided each and every person the tools they need to be successful. <br> <br> However, when we visit with these same leaders a few weeks later, the fire we once saw is now merely a flicker: the “real world” of work has overshadowed the excitement they had in the workshop. And despite our best efforts—e.g., post-workshop learning trios, individual coaching sessions, following up with one-day sessions at six months—we wonder if maybe, just maybe, there was something more we could do to help keep that passion burning brightly. <br> <br> One leader of a government social service agency I have worked with extensively—training nearly 600 leaders in The Leadership Challenge—has implemented a creative way of keeping others focused on The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® with meaningful and targeted email communications. Each weekly email reminds them of one of the 30 behaviors associated with The Five Practices, encouraging leaders to focus their thoughts and actions on that specific area for the entire week. And, unique among other organizations I work with, this client also includes inspiring quotes and links to additional resources, from YouTube and Ted Talks to HBR, which truly bring the Practices to life and continue the learning. Here is one example: <br> <br>

                <strong>What Can We Learn?</strong>

                <br> 
                <strong>Behavior #18 – Asks “What can we learn?” when things don’t go as expected.</strong> 
                <br> 
                <br> Good morning LCers! (Leadership Challengers) 
                <br> 
                <br> Last week, I started highlighting the behaviors of The Leadership Challenge in hopes of focusing our thoughts and actions on one topic for an entire week. As a reminder, we focused on 
                <strong>Behavior #9 - Actively listens to diverse points of view.</strong> How did that go for you? Did you see a difference? I would love to hear your stories from your week! 
                <br> 
                <br> This week, I want to focus on 
                <strong>Behavior #18 – Asks “What can we learn?” when things don’t go as expected.</strong> 
                <br> 
                <br> This is really an easy concept to understand but, at the same time, really difficult to put into practice— especially in a fast-paced environment like ours. I think the reason it is so difficult to put into practice is because it takes a high level of vulnerability on the part of everyone involved in the process. We are often quick to look for someone or something to blame when things don’t go as expected. We often ask “What went wrong” verses “What can we learn?” and there is a HUGE difference. 
                <br> 
                <br> Here also is some cool stuff I found that may help make this behavior a little easier to put into practice:

                 I hope and trust that you find value in some of these resources and that, either at work or at home, when something doesn’t go the way that we had anticipated we ask “What can we learn?” versus “What went wrong?”. 
                <br> 
                <br> Finally, thank you so much for your personal commitment to The Leadership Challenge! We are hearing wonderful success stories about how The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® are being creatively implemented. If you have a story that you would like to share, please give me a call or send me an email! We would all like to celebrate your small (and big) wins! 
                <br> 
                <br> Enjoy the week! 
                <br> 
                <br> 
               </blockquote>Notice how the email mentions the focus from the previous week and encourages reflection? <br> 
               <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
                <em>As a reminder, we focused on <strong>Behavior #9 - Actively listens to diverse points of view. </strong>How did that go for you? Did you see a difference? I would love to hear your stories from your week!</em> 
                <br> 
               </blockquote>This encourages leaders to stay engaged, providing small reminders that leadership is about learning.&nbsp;<br> 
               <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"> 
                <br> 
               </blockquote>Another example focuses on seeking out challenging opportunities to test leadership skills, and includes the following message:&nbsp;<br> 
               <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">

                <strong>Challenge Yourself…</strong>&nbsp;
                <br> 
                <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"> 
                 <br> 
                </blockquote>
                <strong>Behavior #3 – Seeks out challenging opportunities that test his/her own skills and abilities.</strong>&nbsp;
                <br> 
                <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"> 
                 <br> 
                </blockquote>It’s pretty easy to get comfortable, isn’t it? Be it at work or in our personal lives, we as human beings generally choose to take the path of least resistance. Why wouldn’t we, right? We have the ability to create scenarios, situations, and processes in our life that make our day “easier”. Most of the time this can be a really good thing! Can you imagine doing everything that we need to do every day without so many of the “shortcuts” we have created?&nbsp;
                <br> 
                <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"> 
                 <br> 
                </blockquote>I think this is why this exemplary leadership behavior, associated with the Practice of Challenge the Process, is so critical to our growth and development as leaders. Consider the following quote:&nbsp;

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/TLC%20Forum%202017%20banner.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 54px;"><br> Sometimes the risks you take pay off. For me, my journey began in June of 1987. That’s when Jim Kouzes traveled from the sunny West Coast to a very rustic camp in southwest Ohio to help me introduce his brand new model of leadership to a group of managers from AT&amp;T, where I was employed at the time. And the impact it had on me was profound: within 6 months I’d conspired with other colleagues to form a business whose sole mission was to take Jim and Barry’s refreshingly practical model—The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®—to organizations across the globe. <br> <br> Then just last month at <a href="http://www.leadershipchallengeforum.com/" target="_blank">The Leadership Challenge Forum 2017</a> in San Diego, I had the privilege of again joining a few hundred learning and development colleagues from around the world who came together to celebrate the sixth edition of the groundbreaking book, <em><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119278961.html" target="_blank">The Leadership Challenge</a></em>, and the 30th anniversary of The Five Practices methodology that has literally become the worldwide standard for what leaders need to do to help people produce extraordinary results in their work and personal lives. <br> <br> For two full days I engaged with like-minded leadership development professionals, learned from experts in a variety of breakout sessions, and walked away with three important observations/lessons: <br> <br> <strong>Lesson One:</strong> There is no longer any reason to spend time on the question, “Do leaders make a positive difference?” The answer is: they do. Case closed. And here’s why. <br> <br> In their opening keynote presentation on Day One of the Forum, Jim and Barry highlighted some of their most recent findings—research findings that directly connect more frequent leader behaviors related to The Five Practices with higher levels of trust, overall engagement, peoples’ willingness to work hard, leader effectiveness, and just about everything else. The authors have provided this evidence for years. It is now simply even more complete and convincing. But, as my journalism friends tell me, “Always verify your facts with a second source.” So following that advice, I offer the words of WD-40 Company CEO Garry Ridge who keynoted on Day Two. In a nutshell, here is what he said: <br> <br> 
               <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
                <em>At WD-40, we do this leadership stuff throughout the company. And in a world where 30% employee engagement is the norm, virtually all of our engagement metrics are above the 90th percentile. Our overall employee engagement score is 93%. And just so you know, our return to shareowners averages over 15% annually. We doubled our growth the past few years and will do the same in the next few.</em> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
               </blockquote>WD-40’s results are indeed impressive, but there are many other examples like them. Leadership makes a difference. The enduring value of The Leadership Challenge is it tells us what leaders actually do when they are making that positive, bottom line difference. I rest my case. <br> <br> <strong>Lesson Two:</strong> There is that wise saying that if you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room. Not once during the Forum did I ever feel the slightest urge to move along. The breakout session presenters were awesome in their enthusiasm and their messages. One simply could not help but learn something of value about The Five Practices. There were clients, Certified Masters, authors, and a variety of other smart and experienced people sharing their expertise and lessons learned. It was quite amazing to witness how many ways The Five Practices are being utilized to help people and their organizations grow and prosper. Many thanks to all who volunteered their time and energy to help all of us continue to learn about leading more effectively. <br> <br> <strong>Lesson Three:</strong> Never underestimate the power of a shared vision. Sadly, our world today is filled with a lot of dissension, divisiveness, anger, and fear. There is much more shouting, grandstanding and bickering than there is listening, questioning, and understanding. It is happening between countries as well as within countries, as we in the US know so well. <br> <br> At the Forum there were people from all around the world, with many deep differences. There were recognizable differences in ethnicity, race, gender, and so forth. And there were less obvious differences in factors such as perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, values, and—dare I say—even political persuasions. <br> <br> Yet here is what I observed. All of these very different people were reaching out to help one another and to serve the entire community in attendance. They were generous in sharing their knowledge and quick to offer a helping hand. They coached and mentored each other. They gratefully listened to and welcomed the advice and wisdom of others. They laughed and broke bread together, hugged and applauded one another. They did this, in spite of all those real-life differences, because there was one thing they had in common: the shared purpose of liberating the leader in other people through The Leadership Challenge. Everyone was committed to making the world, or at least their individual piece of the world, a little better place through more effective leadership. And that made all the difference. <br> <br> Shared vision is indeed the tie that binds. Perhaps all of us who had the privilege of attending Forum 2017 will remember the spirit of community we experienced and be even more vigilant and intentional in modeling the kind of inspiring leadership we want so many others to embrace and live. <br> <br> <strong>Two final callouts:</strong> Jim and Barry, thank you for your passion and never ending work to enable people around the world to keep learning about great leadership. And to all at Wiley, for all of the sleepless nights, heart palpitations, and high anxiety moments you survived in masterfully making this such a remarkable learning experience…thank you very much for your work, partnership, and commitment.<br> <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Steve%20Coats.jpg" class="image_Float_Left"><br> <strong>Steve Coats,</strong> Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge, is managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a leadership development education and consulting firm.

Where do you start? Among the dozens of actions you can take to improve your effectiveness, what are two or three things you can do immediately to improve your ability to lead? To answer that question, and many others, Jim Kouzes recently sat down to talk <em><a href="http://app.news.wiley.com/e/er?elq_mid=17969&amp;elq_cid=161809&amp;s=1133198723&amp;lid=73146&amp;elqTrackId=4b06f71912214757b48b187c8fe9ccf0&amp;elq=4bfe9fd1cc874f42bfe61b6f9e0990cd&amp;elqaid=17969&amp;elqat=1" target="_blank">Learning Leadership</a></em> with Michelle Pizer, host of the popular14-day online summit called Crack the Leadership Code. During this entertaining and informative 30-minute interview, Jim explores the myths and mindsets of leaders, the powerful role grit plays in building the resilience required of exemplary leadership, and why the characteristic of being forward-looking is so very important. He also culls from the nearly 20 coaching tips provided in Learning Leadership to offer up this piece of advice:&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> <br> &nbsp;Buy yourself a journal, and at the end of each day ask yourself these five questions: <br> 
               <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
                1. Did I do my best to remain positive about my abilities today?
                <br> 2. Did I do my best to focus on exciting future possibilities today?
                <br> 3. Did I do my best to challenge and stretch myself today?
                <br> 4. Did I do my best to learn from other people today?
                <br> 5. Did I do my best to practice a new leadership skill today?
               </blockquote>&nbsp;<br> The point of this exercise, and all the others, is to find ways to deliberately practice leadership daily.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Everybody needs a good pep talk now and again, right? Whether we’re part of a team of sales professionals or product development, or a key executive player, sometimes on the journey to achieve the extraordinary leaders must step up to deliver a motivating speech that Inspires a Shared Vision. Most leaders learn this skill by emulating others, not as a result of any type of formal training. But, as it turns out, there is actually research—called motivating language theory—showing what it takes to psych people up for better performance. <br> <br> Daniel McGinn, author of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Psyched-Up-Science-Preparation-Succeed-ebook/dp/B01M31FYIM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499094166&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=psyched+up " target="_blank">Psyched Up: How the Science of Mental Preparation Can Help You Succeed</a></em> has extensively interviewed dozens of academics and practitioners in business, and studied the seminal work in this field by Jacqueline and Milton Mayfield. And in the most recent issue of the Harvard Business Review, he summarizes the research and his own writing in his article, <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/the-science-of-pep-talks" target="_blank">The Science of Pep Talks</a>. Here he suggests there are three elements that are key to delivering a winning pep talk<br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>direction giving that reduces uncertainty, describing precisely how to do the task and the criteria for evaluating performance</li> 
                <li>expressions of empathy, giving praise and encouragement, or showing concern for the performer</li> 
                <li>meaning-making language, which often includes storytelling that helps to explain why the task is important.&nbsp;</li> 
               </ul> McGinn concludes that all the evidence suggests that once leaders understand these three elements they can learn to use them more skillfully. And for practitioners of The Leadership Challenge, leaders may find new approaches for turning an exciting and ennobling vision into action.

                “When we are great leaders our students are the winners!”
                <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –education professional and The Leadership Challenge® Workshop attendee
                <br> 
                <br> 
               </blockquote>For Diversity Leadership Consultants, 2017 began in the spirit of giving back as we welcomed 19 public school system leaders to The Leadership Challenge® Workshop, offered as part of the Wiley-sponsored Masters Give Back Program. In partnership with Amy Ellis, Assistant Director for the Center for Community Schools and Child Welfare Innovation, Certified Facilitator Allan Lyme and I delivered a workshop experience to a group of dedicated education professionals, school principals, and directors of the Children’s Home Society of Florida. Traveling from around Central Florida to Orlando, these aspiring leaders came together to spend two intensive days learning about The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. All left with commitment goals and follow up commitment partners to make sure they each continued to hone their leadership Practices and behaviors to become even more effective future leaders. <br> <br> Attendees saw real change happen almost immediately as a result of their experience. Among the many thank you notes we received, one participant expressed it best: “Thank you so much for investing in us! I learned so much in two short days. I have put The Five Practices into my behavior and I already notice a big difference. Thanks for giving your time to a great cause. When we are great leaders our students are the winners!” <br> <br> The positive impact of the workshop also has extended beyond the 19 participants; it was so well-received that within the same month Amy Ellis attended our program to become a Trained Facilitator so that she could sustain The Leadership Challenge within her entire organization. <br> <br> At Diversity Leadership Consultants, we have a long-standing commitment to contributing positively to the health and well-being of our community. And this year, we were especially pleased to engage with leaders from the Children’s Home Society, a partnership of corporate sponsors, community leaders, and school administrative staff dedicated to creating a more successful environment in underserved areas to better prepare young adults to graduate from high school and prepare for college and secondary education. Together with the Center for Community Schools and Welfare Innovation, this innovative organization works with local high schools to create Community Schools as it focuses on fulfilling its mission: “to break the generational cycle of child abuse in more families, to protect children from harm, to heal children who have been hurt, to create strong, stable families, to help children grow up safe, healthy and prepared for life.”<br> <br> I always have believed that the Masters Give Back program is great way to show appreciation to those who serve the community. And that belief is reinforced more every time I am honored to donate one of these Leadership Challenge workshops. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Stephen Hoel</strong> is a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge and president of Diversity Leadership Consultants, a leadership development organization focusing on improving the effectiveness of leadership and team skills.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> A couple of news items caught my attention recently, which reinforced a key lesson of leadership. First was the United Airlines saga where they forcibly removed a seated passenger from a plane in order to accommodate a crew member. We all know how that turned out. Dr. Dao and United settled for an undisclosed amount. And a few days later, the CEO of United was front and center at a Senate hearing where he was blasted (along with other airlines) for lousy service. Add that to the $1.4 billion fall in market cap United immediately experienced and one could conclude that was a very costly blunder. Just a few days later, I then read about the settlement of $2.8 billion to be paid by VW for criminal penalty charges related to the company’s diesel engine emission scheme. Add that to the $17 billion in auto buy backs, other expenses, and the legal costs for the executives who were indicted and you have another very costly blunder. &nbsp; <br> <br> Here is the lesson to never forget. When facing a crossroads of sacrificing profitability or credibility, always choose to preserve credibility. <strong>Always</strong>. Losses in profitability can be recovered much more quickly than losses in credibility. Airlines, automobiles, manufacturing—there are many industries that have experienced very tough years financially and worked their way back to prosperity. But never forget Arthur Andersen, one of the most highly-regarded companies in any industry, who literally went out of business within months after losing the trust of clients from the Enron fiasco. They were never able to bounce back. <br> <br> The bottom line: both United and VW had to buy their way out of the messes they behaved themselves into. They ended up losing financially and significantly harming their reputation—two of the most important bottom line measures of any business. &nbsp; <br> <br> As a leader, make it a point to continually ensure that all in your organization do their very best to strengthen personal and organizational credibility. When customers can no longer trust that you will treat them with respect, tell them the truth about your offerings, or deal with them ethically, you can bet they will go elsewhere. And if you think it is costly to win a new customer, think about how much more it will be to recapture one who has felt betrayed by you in the past. <br> <br> Take care, and keep striving to be an exemplary role model of credibility. <br> <br> <br> <strong><img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Steve%20Coats.jpg" class="image_Float_Left"><br> Steve Coats</strong>, Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge, is managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a leadership development education and consulting firm.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> I recently found a great<a href="https://t.co/uUcdHh5Xy4" target="_blank"> TED Talk</a> by Harvard Professor Linda Hill whose message really resonated and, for me, linked directly to The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. From her research, which she has published in her recent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Collective-Genius-Practice-Leading-Innovation/dp/1422130029" target="_blank"><em>Collective Genius</em></a><em></em> she is basically suggesting that leaders need to create an environment where everyone gets to play and everyone feels that their voice adds value.&nbsp; I love this message. But she then goes on to also suggest that the leadership required to make this happen is significantly different than the standard leadership learning.&nbsp;While that may be true of other models of leadership, I find that what it takes to lead in the type of creative environment she describes is exactly in line with The Leadership Challenge and The Five Practices.<br> <br> For example, in her talk Professor Hill describes Ed Catmull, founder and CEO of Pixar, and demonstrates how he leads innovation. He is clearly following The Five Practices when he:<br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Is clear about his leadership philosophy (Model The Way) </li> 
                <li>Creates a broad and long-term vision; for example, “An organization at the frontier” in the case of Pixar (Inspire a Shared Vision)</li> 
                <li>Lets people experiment and learn from mistakes (Challenge the Process) </li> 
                <li>Enables everyone to share what they can (Enables Others to Act) </li> 
                <li>Recognizes people for their contribution to the team's success, including babies born in the process of making a Pixar film (Encourage the Heart). </li> 
               </ul> Again, this is a great message about how to lead innovation.&nbsp;It helps us to see how important great leadership is in this process, and how we need to create the environment for “collective genius”.<br> <br> Adapted from an original post, <a href="http://www.stoneridgeconsulting.ca/blog/2017/5/9/the-five-practices-of-leading-innovation" target="_blank">The Five Practices of Leading Innovation</a>, published at Stone Ridge Consulting | Leadership <br> <br> <br> <strong><img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Kelly%20Ann%20McKnight.jpg" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 125px; height: 188px;"><br> Kelly Ann McKnight</strong>, a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge, is a personnel development professional who focuses on bringing innovative training and coaching tools in leadership development, management development, behavioral profiling, and team building to her clients.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Universal Orlando Resort™ has always been committed to developing its leadership talent with targeted curriculum to enhance leadership competence. But with the exponential growth we experienced after the opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter™ in 2010, it was clear that the organization would benefit from a common leadership framework—specific language and identified behaviors that would prepare our leaders to better support their team members’ productivity and engagement. <br> <br> The need for a common language of leadership was particularly evident in the Marketing &amp; Sales Division whose team had recently undergone both a structural reorganization and the introduction of an entirely new system for work processes. That’s when the Division’s Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Alice Norsworthy, introduced the path forward to the Division’s exciting vision for the future using The Leadership Challenge® Workshop. <br> <br> With the help of Certified Master Stephen Hoel of Diversity Leadership Consultants, the Marketing &amp; Sales Senior Leadership Team was the first group to dive deep into The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® model. The group came together for The Leadership Challenge Workshop over two days of intensive learning, self-examination, and group collaboration. In addition, participants had an opportunity to review and discuss their individual LPI®: Leadership Practices Inventory® results, providing them with a roadmap to improve their effectiveness as leaders and bring key learnings back to the workplace and their teams. <br> <br> Of all of The Five Practices, Inspire a Shared Vision made a real impact on Alice who worked on crafting her vision into the wee hours of the morning and shared it with the group on Day Two of the workshop. She has since shared, and continues to share, her vision throughout the Marketing &amp; Sales organization. In fact, Alice and her senior leaders believed so strongly in the content—seeing first-hand how valuable the learning experience was—that they extended participation in the workshop over the next six months to include all other members of marketing and sales leadership. And the impact has clearly been positive: results of the latest Team Member Satisfaction Survey showed significant positive movement (ranging from +1 to +8 point increases) in measures that tie specifically to the behaviors associated with The Five Practices. <br> <br> <strong>Ongoing Support Continues to Deliver Best Practices</strong> <br> With the unqualified success of the initial launch, within the following year Universal Orlando began rolling out The Leadership Challenge Workshop to leaders (managers and above) across all divisions. Now offered monthly, on site, we are proud to say that over 350 of our leaders are on-the-job working collaboratively with their teams and each other to build a strong culture, highly-productive teams, and a high-performing organization. And senior leaders within the Marketing &amp; Sales Division continue to demonstrate their commitment to The Leadership Challenge by personally opening each workshop, sharing highlights and “ahas” from their own experiences and the specific actions they are taking every day to continue their leadership journey. <br> <br> For example, Senior Vice President of Sales Management Frank Belzer highlights his learning in the Practice of Encourage the Heart. He always believed this was one of his strengths—showing appreciation, creating a spirit of community. But his LPI results suggested otherwise. As a result, one of the commitments he made was to send personal thank you notes. To this day, he has a recurring task on his calendar and follows through each week to provide recognition to those on both his immediate team and others who support them in delivering on their goals. Frank also created an Annual Leadership Award, which he presents to those on his leadership team who model the behaviors of The Five Practices. This added recognition at the leadership level is unique across Universal Orlando and truly has an impact on the motivation of his senior leaders. In addition, over the last year Frank has used The Five Practices as the foundation for reviewing his team’s current state and ongoing goals for team member engagement, as well as a framework to discuss cooperation across departments. <br> <br> Additional best practices that truly make a difference in reinforcing The Five Practices at Universal Orlando include:<br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>During the workshop graduation ceremony, participants verbally commit to their fellow classmates and their leaders who are in attendance what their action steps will be over the next 30 days. In addition to their Certificate of Completion, they also are given a “valuable” blue glass bead to return to one of the facilitators after they have completed their 30-day commitments.&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>For all workshop alumni, inspirational and practical tools are emailed monthly to maintain momentum and everyone is encouraged to visit The Leaders’ Lounge frequently—an Intranet site where best practices are shared on how The Five Practices have been successfully applied throughout Universal Orlando.&nbsp;</li> 
               </ul> In our experience, clearly some of the success factors in this rollout reinforce the power of starting the movement toward a unified leadership framework with not only a compelling business reason (the Marketing &amp; Sales Division’s reorganization and process changes) but having sponsorship of and active participation by executive-level leaders. Additionally, having the Division’s leadership participate in the workshop in such an intense and highly-interactive way created the common experience and common language that was the catalyst we needed to launch a wider rollout across Universal Orlando. And finally, to have specific reinforcement and ongoing conversation and application throughout the organization truly contributes to stronger leaders at every level, which leads to stronger team member satisfaction and superior guest satisfaction at Universal Orlando Resort.<br> <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Kirsten%20Abbott-West.jpg" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 100px; height: 140px;"><br> <strong>Kirsten Abbott-West</strong> is currently the Director of Talent Development, Leadership, and Back-of-House for Universal Orlando Resort™ where she is responsible for driving overall strategy and execution of leadership development across the organization.

After 20 years in the field as a teacher, school founder, principal, leadership coach, and organizational consultant, I have found that the answer lies in listening. And in my new book, <em><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111918634X.html" target="_blank">The Listening Leader</a></em>, I explore listening as a complex act that requires intention, skill, and humility—behaviors associated directly with The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®—and demonstrate how it is also the cornerstone of leading across differences in race, gender, and culture. <br> <br> <em>The Listening Leader </em>weaves together story and theory to provide practical tools and key practices leaders can use to align their actions with the principles of <em>The Leadership Challenge:</em> <br> <br> 
               <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
                <strong>Humanize Your Data.</strong> We’ve grown accustomed to relying on what I call satellite data: high-level, quantitative metrics of success. While these are essential for measuring progress, leaders must also pay attention to qualitative, street-level data: the micronarratives (or anecdotes) that live by the water cooler or in the parking lot. Paying attention to street data and micronarrative patterns helps us hone our “outsight” and begin to transform a stuck organizational culture. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <strong>Practice Deep Listening.</strong> Deep listening is the foundational skill of The Listening Leader. It’s also a vehicle for building relational capital with others which, in turn, fuels organizational change. To practice deep listening, leaders must Encourage the Heart: pay attention to subtle cues and nonverbal signals, model empathy through active listening, and demonstrate affirmation toward those around us. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <strong>Practice Strategic Listening.</strong> If deep listening builds relational power, strategic listening builds brainpower. It’s the key to influencing others and unlocking mindsets and beliefs that act as barriers to change. Strategic listening requires leaders to orient others toward Inspiring a Shared Vision; incorporate reflective questioning as a core leadership technique; leverage data as a third point in collegial conversations; and help people figure out their next move. This practice is also foundational for Enabling Others to Act in courageous and innovative ways. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <strong>Redesign Your Meetings.</strong> Finally, The Listening Leader provides a four-part framework for redesigning meetings so that they cultivate high-performing teams. Detailed and practical hands-on advice demonstrates how leaders can reimagine staff and team meetings into what might best be described as a town square of human dynamics—a place that can either thwart or accelerate your organizational change efforts.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> There are many myths, stereotypes, and opinions about millennials—a generation that is projected to be 50% of the global workforce by 2020. Depending on who you ask they are either lazy, entitled trophy kids or creative, aspiring difference-makers. However, one consistent perspective is that millennials are quite different from other generations in the workforce. And yet there is plenty of existing research to suggest that what we think we know about what motivates this generation, what values they hold, and how different they really are from others is much more complex than we might think. <br> <br> As a millennial myself—and a mom who is quite literally raising the next generation of leaders—it has become part of my life’s work to help others separate fact from fiction when it comes to understanding the habits, values, and attitudes of millennials. I’m keenly interested in how perspectives of leadership are different for new generations. How does what my generation thinks of leadership compare to the generations that came before? How do I perceive leadership differently than my children will as they grow up? And what does that mean for us as practitioners in leadership development? How will those differences impact how we lead in the workplace (and, for those like me with children, parent the next generation)? <br> <br> In my search for understanding and to begin to answer some of these questions, I began partnering with Certified Master Steve Coats in 2014 to investigate just how different millennial perspectives of leadership may or may not be when compared to others. Using the Characteristics of Admired Leaders (CAL) research categories (e.g., ambitious, honest, competent, inspiring, forward-looking, supportive) developed by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner, we wanted to understand if millennials looked for similar or different attributes in leaders they admire compared to the overall historical findings Jim and Barry have been collecting for more than three decades. <br> <br> Over a two-year period, we gathered CAL survey information from more than 2,000 individuals—mostly students attending a variety of universities and participating in a structured internship program. Representing a diverse mix of disciplines and ethnicities, all participants were born after 1977 (the U.S. Census Bureau’s official birth year for the oldest millennials). From the research we collected, we then compared the responses from our study participants with the latest data provided by Kouzes and Posner from their longitudinal database. <br> <br> 
               <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Slide1%20copy.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 302px;">
                <br> 
               </div> <br> The results so far, as the graphic above suggests, highlight a few significant differences and areas for additional research and further discussion—especially among those of us committed to developing the next generation of leaders. <br> <br> <strong>HONESTY… as an admired characteristic of leaders</strong> <br> Kouzes and Posner’s historical CAL research has consistently found “honest” to be the most frequently identified attribute when survey respondents are asked to select seven characteristics they look for if they are to willingly follow someone. The most recent data indicates that “honest” was selected by 89% of all survey participants. <br> <br> Our collective millennial data is consistent with Kouzes and Posner’s findings, suggesting that honesty is undoubtedly important. However, our research found that this may be a declining trend since millennial respondents only made this selection 66% of the time. Furthermore, within the millennials we surveyed there was a significant decrease in the “honest” response between those born in 1977-1993 (Early Generation Millennials) compared to those born in 1994 and later (Late Generation Millennials). Older millennials selected “honest” 70% of the time, while younger millennials only selected “honest” 57% of the time. <br> <br> 
               <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Slide2%20copy.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 269px;">
                <br> 
               </div> <br> Why is honesty on a declining trend? Do millennials have more doubt and distrust than older generations? My gut reaction is that the millennial generation, more than others, has witnessed dishonest leaders successfully keep—and even advance—in their positions of power. It certainly doesn’t mean that those leaders are any more or less effective, but it does seem to me that millennials have witnessed this phenomenon with more frequency throughout our formative years. <br> <br> <strong>AMBITIOUS… as an admired characteristic of leaders</strong> <br> A more striking contrast between Kouzes and Posner’s historical CAL research and our millennial data is found when we compare responses from these surveys to the characteristic “ambitious.” Only 18% of historical survey participants selected “ambitious” among their top seven most admired characteristics of leaders versus 53% of our millennial survey participants. When we further analyzed millennial data by gender and age, the response rate remained consistent. <br> <br> 
               <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Slide3%20copy.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 268px;">
                <br> 
               </div> <br> Why is ambition so important to millennials? Has “ambitious” simply replaced “forward looking” as the preferred language to describe an aspirational or future state? Or is there truly a desire to know that one’s leader is striving for the future versus merely envisioning it? My personal opinion is that millennials equate ambition to “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1501111108%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJ2F6RDUSIYCWQMFQ%26tag%3Dsa-sym-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1501111108" target="_blank">grit</a>,” as popularly coined by author and scholar Angela Duckworth in her book by the same name. With an economic recession already under our belts, we know what it’s like to have to fight for what you want—and we want a leader that’s willing to dream big and go to bat for us. Ambition implies action. And that’s the kind of intrinsic motivation we want surrounding us. <br> <br> <strong>Differences among female and male millennials</strong> <br> As Steve and I explored whether there were characteristic preferences for male and female respondents to our millennial survey, we discovered an intriguing difference: while female millennials rated “supportive” and “dependable” among the seven characteristics they admire most, males selected “competent” and “intelligent.” <br> <br> 
               <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Slide4%20copy.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 274px;">
                <br> 
               </div> <br> These are vastly different attributes: emotional versus intellectual. Why might that be? As women have increasingly entered the workforce over the past few decades, have their needs from a leader been different than those of their male counterparts? Do they admire “support” and “dependability” with hopes that those traits are the key to help them be an effective leader? From my own, personal experience as a full-time working, millennial mom, I’ve certainly found that supportive and dependable leaders make a greater difference in my work and life—regardless of their intellect on the job. Personal connection and individualized care make me feel more inspired, enabled, and empowered to do good work. <br> <br> <strong>Our research moving forward</strong> <br> While our millennial research helps us understand one generation’s perspectives on leadership, we know our journey doesn’t stop here. GenEdge is already on the map as the generation following millennials (according to the U. S. Census Bureau, those born 1997 to the present) and they are sure to have their own unique traits and preferences. <br> <br> The data we’ve collected so far raises very interesting questions that we hope to explore with further research to better understand both the “why” and the implications for all of us dedicated to leadership development. And we are on track and excited to continue data collection and analysis for our third consecutive year. We hope to gather at least 500 more survey responses to add to the database, as well as explore topics and audiences for focus group discussions. We look forward to being a part of leadership conversations with millennials and beyond! <br> <br> As a mom, I’m committed to leading my family and recognize my privilege in raising future leaders. I am renewed daily by my children and their refreshing view of the world. May all of my colleagues in The Leadership Community also delight in knowing that our work matters for future generations. <br> <br> <strong><br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/majka_photo_cropped.jpg" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 100px; height: 146px;"><br> Brittney Majka</strong> is a Certified Master-in-Training with The Leadership Challenge and has been working in the leadership development field for more than 10 years.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <strong>Q: What CEOs would you list as being prime examples of good leadership? <br> </strong><br> A: I think it’s important to say that there are many CEOs who exemplify good leadership. For example, Rachel Argaman, CEO of TFE Hotels in Australia, Ed Catmull, president of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios, or Doug Conant, former CEO of Campbell Soup, are three examples that immediately come to mind. And in his book, Flashes of Thought, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum articulates many of the principles that we find in exemplary leaders everywhere. But it’s important to point out that leadership is set of skills and abilities that are learnable by anyone. In my and Barry Posner’s research, the vast majority of leaders are not CEOs and are more likely to be middle level managers or non-managers. <br> <br> Throughout our work we tell stories of ordinary people who’ve gotten extraordinary things done. They are from all over the globe, from all age groups and walks of life. They represent a wide variety of organizations, public and private, government and NGOs, high-tech and low-tech, small and large, schools and professional services. Chances are you haven’t heard of most of them. They’re not public figures, famous people, or mega-stars. They’re people who might live next door or work in the next cubicle over. <br> <br> We’ve focused on everyday leaders because leadership is not about position or title. It’s not about organizational power or authority. It’s not about celebrity or wealth. It’s not about the family you are born into. It’s not about being a CEO, president, general, or prime minister. And it’s definitely not about being a hero. Leadership is about relationships, about credibility, and about what you do. You don’t have to look up for leadership. <br> <br> You don’t have to look out for leadership. You only have to look inward. You have the potential to lead others to places they have never been before. <br> <br> <em>Adapted from an interview with Jim Kouzes, What Makes a Good Leader? published in Gulf Business, the premier business monthly reaching leaders across the Middle East, including UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia.</em> <br> <br> <br> <strong>Jim Kouzes</strong> is the Dean’s Executive Fellow of Leadership, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University. Cited by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> as one of the twelve best executive educators in the U.S., he was also winner of the 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award by Trust Across America. Together with Barry Posner, he is author of <em>The Leadership Challenge</em>—soon to be published in its sixth edition—and over thirty other books and workbooks on leadership and leadership development, including the most recent <em>Learning Leadership</em>, which was selected by<em> Strategy+Business</em> as one of the 2016 Best Business Books of Year.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> What we hear from leaders that we work with in our coaching is that finding their voice through their leadership philosophy helps them feel more effective and prepared in their roles. Indeed, the research that Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner have been conducting for nearly 35 years echoes that sentiment. It also provides an even more compelling reason for leaders to contemplate their leadership philosophy: when you have a clear leadership philosophy, the <em>PEOPLE AROUND YOU</em> are more effective, too. <br> <br> <strong>Defining a Leadership Philosophy</strong> <br> Your leadership philosophy is the guidepost for your leadership. It’s what you believe to be true about how you should lead, what contribution you want to make to those around you. In essence, it’s how you aspire to show up as a leader. <br> <br> Even if you already have a leadership philosophy, it may be worth the time to revisit it. Life changes, business changes, circumstances change, and people change. Have you changed? Working through the process we present here may help you look at your leadership philosophy through a different lens. It may validate what you already believe about your leadership and enable you to lead more confidently. <br> <br> To help leaders create a philosophy of leadership in our coaching work, we use the following four-step process, focusing first on determining personal values (through a values experience, lifeline, etc.) and then writing and sharing the philosophy. <br> <br> <strong>Step One:</strong> <strong>Create Your Lifeline</strong> <br> The first step in creating or updating your leadership philosophy is to reflect on your past. Understanding the past can help you identify themes, patterns, and beliefs that both underscore why you care about certain matters and how they have shaped who you are as a leader. Think back over your life to recall important turning points—significant events that made a difference in the trajectory of your life. Make a few notes about each moment. Write down the year in which the event occurred. List at least ten events. <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Graph%201.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 358px;"><br> <br> <strong>Step Two: Determine Your Values <br> </strong>Now use your lifeline to determine your values. What common themes are woven through your life events? What are the ideals that attract you? What are the higher-order values that give meaning and purpose to your life and work? You can choose five or six values from the list below or do a web search using the key word “values” to explore a larger list.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 
               <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
                Harmony, &nbsp; &nbsp;Effectiveness, &nbsp; &nbsp;Challenge, &nbsp; &nbsp;Freedom, &nbsp; Health, Decisiveness, &nbsp; &nbsp;Simplicity, &nbsp; &nbsp;Discipline, &nbsp; &nbsp;Beauty, &nbsp; &nbsp;Trust, &nbsp; &nbsp;Family, &nbsp; &nbsp;Wisdom, &nbsp; &nbsp;Communication, &nbsp; &nbsp;Honesty/Integrity, &nbsp; &nbsp;Empathy, &nbsp; &nbsp;Diversity, &nbsp; &nbsp;Growth, &nbsp; &nbsp;Happiness, &nbsp; &nbsp;Truth, &nbsp; &nbsp; Autonomy, &nbsp; &nbsp;Hope, &nbsp; &nbsp;Dependability, &nbsp; &nbsp;Productivity, &nbsp; &nbsp;Humor, &nbsp;Recognition, &nbsp; &nbsp;Friendship, &nbsp; &nbsp;Risk-Taking, &nbsp; &nbsp;Power, &nbsp; &nbsp;Spirituality/Faith, &nbsp; &nbsp;Creativity, &nbsp; &nbsp;Independence, &nbsp;Strength, &nbsp; &nbsp;Variety, &nbsp; &nbsp; Security, &nbsp; &nbsp;Competition, &nbsp; &nbsp;Achievement/Success, &nbsp; &nbsp;Love/Affection, &nbsp; &nbsp;Respect, &nbsp;Loyalty, &nbsp; Open-Mindedness, &nbsp; &nbsp;Patience, &nbsp; &nbsp;Intelligence, &nbsp; &nbsp;Competence, &nbsp; &nbsp;Equality&nbsp;
                <br> 
               </blockquote><br> List the values you have identified and, in your own words, write a brief description of what each value means to you.<br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/Graph%202.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 352px;"><br> <br> <strong>Step Three: Write Your Leadership Philosophy</strong> <br> Once you’ve determined your values and defined what they mean, you have a strong foundation for your leadership philosophy. While the values don’t have to translate one-for-one into your philosophy, they should be a springboard for what you believe about your leadership. Use this writing trick to craft your philosophy: with your personal values in front of you (including the definitions), set a timer for 8 minutes. Write with the aim of having a philosophy completed in that amount of time. Answer the question: What do I believe about my leadership? <br> <br> Say it in your own words. As Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner often advise, “To find your voice, you have to explore your inner self. You have to discover what you care about, what defines you, and what makes you who you are.” You’ve already started this process in steps two and three above. Think about how your lifeline themes and values inform your leadership voice. Our advice is to start using this as your philosophy immediately. If you set it aside to “polish later,” you may not follow through. The goal is to start using this as your daily guidepost, so start with this draft and refine periodically rather than setting it aside and forgetting about it. <br> <br> <strong>Special Note:</strong> Not sure what a leadership philosophy should look like? Here are two examples: <br> 
               <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
                <strong><br> Renee’s Leadership Philosophy</strong> 
                <br> 
                <strong>Values:</strong> Freedom, Equality, Hope, Simplicity, Spirit in Place 
                <br> 
                <em>I believe that every individual—no matter how young or old, how engaged or jaded, or how high up (or low down) in the hierarchy—wants to make a contribution to their work or to their world. They may not know it. They may not show it. But EVERYONE has a contribution to make and it’s a leader’s role – and responsibility even – to help individuals make that contribution a reality. <br> </em>&nbsp; &nbsp;
                <br> 
                <strong>Bill’s Leadership Philosophy <br> Values:</strong> Even-temperedness, Simplicity, Competence, Candor, Family 
                <br> 
                <em>Reduce the scars and stress leaders endure by increasing their professional competence, confidence, and engagement; help them pay it forward.<br> </em>&nbsp; 
                <br> 
               </blockquote><strong>Step Four: Share and Post Your Leadership Philosophy <br> </strong>Your leadership philosophy only comes to life when you share it with others… <br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>your direct reports&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>your co-workers (it’s great team building to ALL share your messages and talk about each one)&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>your manager&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>other colleagues integral to your work and those who are important to you personally&nbsp;</li> 
               </ul> If you use your philosophy as a guidepost for your leadership, people will see it in your actions. However, you should also be honest and open with those you lead and share with them what is important for you as a leader. <br> <br> As you share your leadership philosophy, ask yourself, does it feel authentic? How is it resonating with people? Based on the answers to these questions and feedback from others, revise your leadership philosophy as needed. Finally, post it where you can see it so you are reminded every day of what you believe. <br> <br> Spending time charting out your lifeline helps to identify the themes and events that have shaped who you are as a leader and the values that have been and remain most important to you. Your life events and values help you create a leadership philosophy in your own words, your leadership voice. And finally, sharing your leadership philosophy with others helps transform it from words on paper into leadership actions. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Bill Mugavin,</strong> CPLP and a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge, is a consultant at FlashPoint, a Global Training Partner of The Leadership Challenge committed to ensuring that leaders truly learn practical skills and improve leadership effectiveness—and that the organizations they serve see a strong return on investment.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> In a wide-ranging and deeply insightful <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10154544292806634" target="_blank">letter to the Facebook Community</a>, CEO Mark Zuckerberg tackles the very tough question of whether we are truly building the world we all want. Are we building communities that are safe and supportive, informed and civically-engaged? Are we building an inclusive community that reflects our collective values? Are we—as individuals and organizations, like Facebook—doing all we can to build the long-term social infrastructure to bring humanity together? In what Jim Kouzes calls, “a declaration of community…a model of shared values and shared purpose which all leaders should study,” Zuckerberg answers these questions by laying out, in great detail, Facebook’s commitment to taking an active role in bringing people together in meaningful ways that provide opportunities to help them make the greatest positive impact and build a global community that works for everyone.

We may also talk about enabling our people to act, or about generating engaged employees who have assimilated the vision and values of the business into their everyday working lives. <br> <br> In other words, our focus is very much on the relationship between the business and its people. But, should we be doing more? Should we, in fact, be taking a more holistic view which not only helps people to be engaged with the business but also boosts their personal engagement with their lives outside of work? <br> <br> It’s a question that has come to the fore thanks to a report recently published by Bright Horizons Family Solutions, a UK-based nonprofit that leads the way in providing childcare and early education resources for employers, family networks, and others. <a href="https://www.brighthorizons.co.uk/solutionsatwork/landing-pages/modern-families-index-2017" target="_blank">The Modern Families Index 2017</a> looks at modern families across the U.K. and the interaction between work and home life. Gathering responses from 2,750 working parents, the report highlights the way in which family life is under pressure from work commitments with 72% of parents admitting to catching up on work either in the evenings or weekends. This, together with the fact that only a third of parents responded that they leave work on time each day, leads to regular conflicts between work and family life as well as a raising of stress and burnout levels. <br> <br> Although this particular report provides a snapshot into the lives of working families specifically in the U.K., the stresses and conflicts it identifies—the impact of time-poverty, balancing of the twin currencies of time and money, the ‘flexibility gap’—are true for workers everywhere. And the implications for leaders around the globe are equally as relevant. <br> <br> True leadership means that our responsibility shouldn’t begin and end at the office door. If we really want people to be at their best and give of their best, then it is up to us, as leaders, to create the right conditions that enable people to thrive throughout their lives, not just between nine and five. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Helen Green</strong> is head of Business Development at Quest Leadership, a Global Training Partner of The Leadership Challenge and a consultancy that works with corporate and charitable clients in the UK, Europe, and South Africa using The Leadership Challenge and the Leadership Practices Inventory® to deliver outstanding business results, implement strategic change, and embed values-based cultures.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/drew_dudley_everyday_leadership" target="_blank">Everyday Leadership</a> is a brief, six-minute TEDx presentation by leadership development pro Drew Dudley that really brings home the importance of how the everyday actions of a leader can impact someone’s life. Recalling an encounter he had with a fellow student back in college, he explains how his actions and words had impacted her life for the better and how she was brave enough to tell him that several years later. But unable to remember exactly what he had said or did during their first and only exchange, he realized that sometimes simple actions and words can have a tremendous impact on someone’s life even though we may not realize it at the time. <br> <br> With wit and humor Drew reminds us of one of the most fundamental truths about leadership—that what we say and do matters. And he shares several other leadership lessons that relate directly to The Leadership Challenge and the Practices of Model the Way, Enable Others to Act, and Encourage the Heart. If you’re looking for a good tool to spark a discussion around The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®, try this TEDx video. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Jody R.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Of all The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®, none seems to be as challenging for leaders as Inspire a Shared Vision. In fact, when participants in my Leadership Challenge workshops are asked to think about why this might be, I most often hear responses like “I’m just too busy getting through the day to think about vision”, or “I’m just not a visionary”, or “Nobody is going to listen to my vision”. While I believe leaders honestly feel this is the issue, I think the crux of the matter is that there’s a lack of role models showing us how to do this meaningfully and effectively. There is, however, one truly inspiring exception… <br> <br> Let me introduce you to my friend and hero, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottharrison1" target="_blank">Scott Harrison</a>, founder and CEO of charity:water who lives and breathes the very essence of Inspire a Shared Vision, and whose story (check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE9UvT5ujyg#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE9UvT5ujyg" target="_blank">here</a> 
               <https: watch?v="UE9UvT5ujyg#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE9UvT5ujyg">
                ) offers a fresh example of this leadership practice! 
                <br> 
                <br> Scott’s journey to a life of rich fulfillment and meaning began in 2004. After living the high-life for over a decade as a successful nightclub promoter (and part-giver) in New York City, he began to feel empty and unfulfilled. Spiritually, morally, and emotionally in crisis is how he’s described it. And it forced him to ask himself a simple question, “What would the opposite of my life right now look like?” The answer led him to quit his job and begin to explore what a life of giving to others as would be like. 
                <br> 
                <br> Scott spent two years travelling with an organization called Mercy Ships, documenting the stories of surgical patients who received care on board the floating hospital. He also went into the local West African villages saw people drinking from ponds filled with scum, polluted rivers, and insect-infested swamps. Scott saw first-hand the profound affect that dirty water had on people’s lives and he was both shocked and angered. He began learning more about the over 660 million people in the world living without access to clean water and came back to New York City determined to make a difference. So, he did what he knew how to do—he threw a party! Scott charged people the amount of his age to come to his birthday bash and raised enough money to provide a community in Uganda with clean water. 
                <br> 
                <br> Scott’s first birthday-bash fundraiser ignited a crazy idea. And in 2006, he founded 
                <a href="https://www.charitywater.org/projects/#https://www.charitywater.org/projects" target="_blank">charity:water</a>&nbsp;with an innovative approach to Inspire a Shared Vision. 
                <br> 
                <br> Scott knew that the key to moving his own vision forward was to listen to and mobilize individuals to start talking about their own investment in the “cause”. And as he launched charity:water, he gave everyone the opportunity to participate in the organization’s vision in their own way. Scott’s willingness to invite others into the movement has proven to be a critical factor in what has become charity:water’s phenomenal success: 21,000+ water projects funded in 24 countries, providing 6.4 million people with clean water! It also is the door through which I and my family entered to become personally engaged in Scott’s shared vision several years later. 
                <br> 
                <br> In 2010, my husband and I found ourselves in Ethiopia. We were there to meet our new son Tariku (which in Amharic means “his story”) who we were adopting at age 4 ½. We learned from his Ethiopian caseworker that he lived in a hut in a rural village where he slept on the dirt floor next to a donkey for the first four years of his life. And as one of the 600+ million people globally who don’t have access to clean drinking water, from a young age he would walk with his older stepbrother to a filthy pond to collect their water for the day—for drinking, washing, and cooking. That same water is what took the life of Tariku’s little brother, so sick with diarrhea from dirty drinking water. When we arrived in the U.S. Tariku, too, had horrible stomach problems and parasites from the water he had been drinking. But we were fortunate to have access to powerful antibiotics and he recovered with proper treatment. If only it had been that simple for his brother. 
                <br> 
                <br> About two months after Tariku’s homecoming, we took a trip to Washington D.C. Visiting the World War II Memorial, we were at the edge of its large water fountain when Tariku got on his knees, leaned over, and cupped the water in his hand as if he was going to drink it. I grabbed his hand and told him not to drink it; the water was dirty and that wasn't what it was for. (Oh the irony! That water was much cleaner than any water he'd ever drunk in Ethiopia.) Tariku looked up at me, confused, and asked, "For animals?" I said, no. He asked, "To wash?" I said, no. Then he said "What for then?” What for, indeed! Here we are in America, where we have the luxury of clean water simply being a decoration to look at. It was mind boggling for Tariku. 
                <br> 
                <br> It wasn’t long after that we began talking about the dirty water crisis in the world and what we could do together as a family, with Tariku often saying, “I don’t want any more kids to die from dirty water, mama.” When we discovered the work of charity:water, our family became a big supporter of Scott’s shared vision. That support includes Tariku who, starting with his 5th birthday, has given up getting presents and, instead, asks for money to be donated to help a village in the Central African Republic get clean water.

                <br> Tariku, at his birthday party, showing his friends children in Africa drinking from their new water well That was just the beginning of Tariku developing his own personal vision. Over the past six years, he has spoken at various schools about the dirty water crisis, talking to kids about how they can make a difference in the world (even though they aren’t adults). He continues to forego birthday gifts, raising $30,000 to date for clean water projects in three different countries. And in 2014, Tariku was honored by charity:water for his commitment and contribution to the cause. At the event in New York City, he also had the chance to thank Scott in person for inspiring him to engage others in his passion.

Had Scott Harrison not passionately told the story of charity:water, my son may not have had the pathway to engage in his own vision of helping to ensure that by the end of his lifetime no child will ever die of causes related to dirty drinking water again. 
                <br> 
                <br> Scott and Tariku offer proof that one person’s desire and clear invitation to participate in a vision on behalf of the common good begets another, which begets another. This is how individuals, families and communities are changed for the better. And it starts with just one person. 
                <br> 
                <br> In this New Year, I encourage us all to get in touch with our passion—the thing that drives us and motivates us to do what we do. Ask yourself what the higher meaning and purpose of your work is, and throw your efforts into authentically living and communicating that every day to those around you. People WILL take notice of your passion and enthusiasm and want to come along with you.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> At last year’s Leadership Challenge Forum, Dr. Samineh Shaheem gave a powerful keynote in which she suggested that we take time at the end of each day to write down “the best thing about my day.” Her prescription resonated with me because expressing gratitude is a personal project of mine. And reflecting on those things that make up the best of my days, as a member of this wonderful community, a flood of ideas came to mind. But here are a few of the things I am most grateful for: <br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>The daily lessons I learn from my friend and collaborator, Barry Posner, through his application of the rigor of science to the art leadership—and his personal generosity.&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>The humor, patience, encouragement, wisdom, and love of my spouse, Tae, who makes me feel like the luckiest man alive.&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>The hope and optimism that exude from those who have graciously and enthusiastically participated in our work.&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>The universality of our message and how it is shared around the world.&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>The reminder that we can't do it alone. We can’t lead alone, and we can't learn alone.&nbsp;</li> 
               </ul> The research on gratitude unquestionably supports how beneficial it is to count your blessings. Robert A. Emmons, professor of psychology at University of California, Davis and the leading expert in the field, finds that people who practice gratitude, compared to those who do not, are healthier, more optimistic, more positive, and better able to cope with stress. They are also more alert, more energized, more resilient, more willing to offer support to others, more generous, and more likely to make progress toward important goals. <br> <br> The other thing I love about gratitude is that counting your blessings costs absolutely nothing, and it pays daily dividends. You can’t ask for a better investment than that! <br> <br> A cousin of gratitude is meaning, a topic that has been trending lately and one I have been examining. In fact, I recently was reviewing some personal correspondence with Jennifer Aaker, a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, who has been doing research on meaning and, in particular, the differences between a meaningful life and a happy life. In discussing some of what she and her fellow researchers are discovering, Jennifer shared this: “In one study, we asked half of our subjects to think about creating happiness with small acts in the next 48 hours, and the other half were asked to create meaningfulness. They came back to the lab two days later and rated how happy they were. The people in the happiness condition were much less happy than those in the meaningfulness condition.” Yes, you read that right. “The people in the happiness condition were much less happy than those in the meaningfulness condition.” <br> <br> So why is that? Jennifer and her colleagues learned that the difference was in how they spent their time. People in the meaningfulness condition “spent their time in ways that made them feel more connected to others—and that feeling of connectedness drove the higher levels of happiness.” So, the secret to lasting happiness is not to pursue happiness per se, but to spend time connecting with others and doing things for others. <br> <br> These findings reminded me of something that Michael Steger said. Michael is a professor of psychology at Colorado State University and an expert on what makes a meaningful life. He concluded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLFVoEF2RI0" target="_blank">TEDx talk</a> 
               <https: watch?v="RLFVoEF2RI0">
                 he gave on the topic by asking the audience to consider changing the nature of the conversation about living a meaningful life. He asked them to consider this: “What if instead of trying to live a meaningful life, you and I tried to give a meaningful life?” 
                <br> 
                <br> Now that’s a provocative question for all of us to consider, isn’t it? What if we were to 
                <em>give</em> a meaningful life to others? What would that look like? 
                <br> 
                <br> A good place to start is to take Dr. Sam’s recommendation to heart: set aside a few moments at the end of each day to remember the best of what the day has brought you—what has made your life meaningful. And think of all the various ways you can give meaning to others, too. This is part of the magic of what we do as a community when we help aspiring leaders be their best. As we share principles and practices of how to 
                <em>give</em> others a more meaningful life, we in turn enable our leaders and constituents to 
                <em>have</em> a more meaningful life. 
                <br> 
                <br> Thank you all for the gifts you are giving to others. The New Year will bring us many more opportunities to share our gifts, and I hope that it also brings you much to be grateful for. 
                <br>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> I first studied The Leadership Challenge in my MBA class in Oslo, Norway back in 2000. What impressed me most was how very simple, yet profound, The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® model was. Ever since, as a leader and coach working with clients and organizations throughout Asia and the U.S., The Five Practices and the research behind them have stuck with me. But it wasn’t until I experienced The Leadership Challenge® Workshop and Facilitator Training, and then attended my first Leadership Challenge Forum in 2015 that I realized I was ready to bring this excellent leadership program and all of its related training and coaching to my clients in Shanghai. <br> <br> Once I decided to take on this new challenge, my first call was to Certified Master Tom Pearce. His five years of experience living and working throughout Asia made him the perfect choice to mentor me through the process and show me the ropes on how best to bring The Leadership Challenge to China. To-date it has been our honor to host two Open Enrollment programs and have the opportunity to share with approximately 20 aspiring leaders the power of The Leadership Challenge to transform organizations. Participants included professionals in HR, OD, and operations, consultants, and line managers from such multi-national companies as Alibaba, Bunge, American Axle Manufacture, Trina Solar, DDI, and AIA. <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/5Ps_Shanghai.jpg" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 200px; height: 141px;"><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> &nbsp;<br> Participants in the 2nd Open enrollment Program, August 2016<br> <br> Under Tom’s guidance, we adapted some of the case studies and examples so our Shanghai participants could easily link to their life and this workshop. Unlike learners in the West, Chinese learners are just now becoming familiar with experiential learning techniques. Our learning process, especially in elementary through high school, is much more pedantic and less self-directed than learning in the Western Hemisphere. However, once ignited, the Chinese corporate classroom becomes very active and engaged. Indeed, Tom noticed this when he told me, “The use of energizing activities after lunch and in the afternoon was really terrific. I’ll be taking that back to my clients in the US!” <br> <br> To customize the programs’ content for our Shanghai participants, we adapted some of the case studies and created examples specific to their life and work experience. To illustrate the notion of the importance of making leadership everyone’s business, for example, Tom and I developed a module for teaching that used the metaphor of two very different types of trains, both of which run throughout China. <br> <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/5Ps_train1.jpg" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 150px; height: 150px;"><br> Our regular train, (what we call the "green-skin" train) has one engine in front that drags all the cars behind, making it very slow.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Newsletter%20Graphics/5Ps_train2.jpg" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 150px; height: 103px;"><br> By contrast, each car of our sleek bullet train has its own engine, working collectively with every other car that is part of the train as a whole; the result is that the bullet train is very fast. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> The parallel to organizational leadership, of course, is made clear: if there is only one leader moving a team or project forward, the work is harder and progress is slower. However, if that same leader enables and empowers others with the tools they need to start their own engines, everyone on the team will be more engaged in taking personal responsibility for the goal at hand, team morale will increase, and the company’s financial performance will improve. <br> <br> Tom and I feel so rewarded by our experience and from the incredible feedback we’ve received. As one participant said, <em>“The Leadership Challenge Workshop and the Facilitator Training have been such an awakening experience. These four days brought lots of “ah ha!” moments for me. I’ve been doing organization development in the corporate world for more than 25 years, and these are the best programs I have ever attended. I will definitely take the action needed to carry this work forward with my leadership team.” </em><br> <br> We are both inspired to continue to work collaboratively to bring The Leadership Challenge to even more leaders throughout the region—to create a tipping point for change. We believe that if just 3% of the leaders in China accept the concept of The Leadership Challenge and practice the model in their work and life, it could trigger the tipping point for massive change to organizations not only here in Shanghai, but also in greater China and across Asia. And we are excited to be a part of it. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Qiu Hua (Connie) Stephens</strong> is a Certified Master-in-Training of The Leadership Challenge and founder of Shanghai-based HeadStart Consulting where she works with clients throughout Asia and the U.S., on leadership development, coaching and organization development.

She also explores how her personal experience as a teacher influenced her thinking about the notion of grit and the role technology and social media can play in enabling human development.<strong> <br> </strong>

It’s especially hard when it comes as a result of a merger or acquisition, when multiple cultures must be blended together to create a new—and, hopefully, better—set of processes that drive how people work and how the highest level of quality services are delivered. That was the challenge for Hartford HealthCare (HHC), a large integrated healthcare network in Connecticut that had grown through acquisitions in recent years to include five acute-care hospitals, four behavioral health networks, various rehabilitation and senior services, as well as a large multispecialty physician group. Each of these newly acquired facilities, networks, and organizations came with its own processes and systems resulting in care delivery that was not as simple or coordinated as it could be. Combined with advances in technology, changing customer needs, and ever-constant legislative influences it was clear to HCC leaders that change was needed. And in 2012, the organization embarked on a rigorous journey to put technology at the very center of a system-wide initiative. Across the system—from acute care facilities to ambulatory practices and multiple service lines—they set out to make technology a true partner in providing exceptional service to patients and coordinating all aspects of care. <br> <br> <strong>Making the HHC vision personal</strong> <br> At the outset, HHC leadership understood how daunting the challenge was. They understood the importance of connecting this project directly to the organization’s vision: “To be nationally respected for excellence in patient care and most trusted for personalized coordinated care.” They also knew that the vision for this project specifically must be made personal. It had to be about people, to reflect the patients and families the organization is committed to serve. So HHC leadership and key members of the communications team began creating clear and compelling stories about what the future would look like once the multi-year system and process changes were in place. For example, two fictional characters were created to help illustrate the service experience of a current patient (Betty) and that of a future patient (Janet) once the transformation in care delivery had been realized. In the current scenario, Betty contends with a healthcare system that is disjointed, disconnected, frustrating, and confusing. Her chronic health conditions go unmanaged because there is little true care coordination. Janet, on the other hand, experiences the type of care that this project was designed to create: one that is fully connected, that supports the patient and the family with a seamless, timely flow of information and care transitions across the continuum. <br> <br> Using “Betty” and “Janet” stories, videos and communication materials were created and shared with all staff that showed how a fully integrated service and data model would improve the healthcare they were able to provide for patients. And it worked! People across the system were inspired about the possible future as the hard work of making the vision a reality began. <br> <br> <strong>Epic CareConnect launches</strong> Within the year, contributors from across the organization came together to lead the transformation efforts and launch what HHC called the Epic CareConnect project. The CareConnect team was responsible for both technical and organizational goals in bringing all of HHC’s entities onto a single electronic platform for clinical, business, and revenue needs. In addition, they were asked to standardize care, processes, and procedures regardless of where patients encountered services throughout the system. And to keep focused on the end goal—to turn every “Betty” story into a “Janet” story—the team created The Five Ones, representing the ultimate experience they desired for the patients they serve: <br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>One health record&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>One standard of excellence&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>One relationship&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>One registration&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>One bill&nbsp;</li> 
               </ul> By making The Five Ones a reality, all aspects of the healthcare system would be woven together to create the seamless system that every “Janet” would experience. “Betty” and “Janet” are now part of the vocabulary at HHC. <br> <br> <strong>Taking the next step in vision development</strong> <br> After more than two years working in the trenches to help lead the transformation and launch Epic CareConnect, two leaders from the project team—Jennifer Lewis, Revenue Cycle Application Director, and Elise Sinha, Acute Care Application Director—felt they needed to recharge their own batteries and find fresh ways to support their teams as the work continued. <br> <br> The intensity of the work, and the resulting stress, had taken its toll on the project teams. Attrition was on the rise, morale was falling, and people were being worn down by the ongoing challenge. Yet a lot of work remained. With key project milestones looming, Jennifer and Elise were looking for a spark that would help keep their great teams of people on track. They found what they were looking for in The Leadership Challenge. <br> <br> As part of an Integris-facilitated two-day The Leadership Challenge® Workshop, Jennifer and Elise were particularly intrigued with the Practice of Inspire a Shared Vision. Exploring the commitments and behaviors associated with this important Practice, they came to realize the trouble their valuable but tired teams were having keeping in view the organization’s broader vision—<em>To be nationally respected for excellence in patient care and most trusted for personalized coordinated care</em>—while working so hard to achieve it. The Epic CareConnect team needed a vision of its own, Jennifer and Elise concluded. So they teamed up to create a small ‘v’ vision—one that was more personal, more front-and-center for the team and yet linked directly into HHC’s broader vision.<br> <br> In creating this new Epic CareConnect team vision, Jennifer and Elise wanted to convey how much they valued their staff and remind them that, although the work was long and hard, it was the <em>why</em> they were doing the work that was so important. They knew that the vision of why the team was created was strong in the beginning of the project, but staff had forgotten as the work got harder, the scope got bigger, and the stakes got higher. After several drafts and feedback from other leaders attending the workshop as well as the workshop’s expert facilitators, Jennifer and Elise’s message to their teams reads: <br> <br> <em>You make Janet’s story happen. <br> <br> You make The Five Ones real. <br> <br> You are the dream makers. <br> <br> Without this team, those dreams are just ideas and hope. <br> <br> Like the Disney imagineers, you turn ideas into a technical reality. <br> <br> You are making healthcare happen in this new model. <br> <br> You have connected the dots for Janet’s story from inception, design, through build, testing, training and implementation. <br> <br> We are scaling the summit together. <br> <br> Betty never had a chance to live the experience, but Janet will. <br> <br> Thanks to you, soon all our patients will have that experience and can focus on healing, instead of navigating a complex and confusing healthcare system, confident that their caregivers have access to all of their clinical information. <br> <br> The work you do is so very important. <br> <br> Thank you.</em> <br> <br> <br> Upon creating and sharing this vision with their workshop friends, Jennifer and Elise debated how to bring this important vision message back to HHC. How would it be received by the staff and other leaders across the Epic CareConnect team? Despite being unsure of exactly what the reaction would be, Jennifer and Elise were eager to share how reconnecting with the HHC vision and creating a compelling new team vision to share had reenergized them personally for the hard work and challenges still remaining. And they were hoping that in sharing this new team vision they could help lift the rest of the team up as well. <br> <br> <strong>Bringing the team vision home</strong> <br> Jennifer and Elise’s first opportunity to share their vision with others at HHC came soon after returning from their Leadership Challenge workshop experience. At a large staff meeting of more than 140 attendees, they received very positive feedback with one attendee responding that “Your vision made me remember why I took this job.” But presenting at a staff meeting was one thing. The larger challenge was how to make sure that this new vision became part of the daily fiber of the hard work that was still ahead for the staff. Luckily, the project team had recently started daily huddles to improve communication, share recognition, and resolve work barriers. Elise and Jennifer posted the vision statement on the team huddle boards and referenced portions of the statement on a weekly basis. Staff were invited to stop at the board and re-read the vision whenever they were feeling overwhelmed, challenged, or worn out. <br> <br> By incorporating the vision statement into quick leadership tips for the staff on a weekly basis, Jennifer and Elise made the vision one of the basic tenets of the program, much like The Five Ones and Janet’s story had become for HHC team members. The Epic CareConnect team was now able to not only see the vision, but better connect to the progress made toward realizing it for the healthcare system. <br> <br> As important as the new vision statement has been to the team, the impact it has had on Elise and Jennifer is also significant. As an outcome of crafting the vision statement, both leaders have new-found energy and inspiration to focus on all aspects of leadership with their teams. They have renewed their attention on staff recognition and engagement, and are now much more solution-oriented with the leadership team in order to improve staff retention and morale. They more frequently find ways to demonstrate how confident they are in the abilities of their staff, their ability to make it over the finish line, and the value this project brings to the community for whom HHC cares. Continuing to Challenge the Process and inviting their teams to do so as well, they consistently focus on making the future of Janet’s story a reality. <br> <br> <strong>The future of integrated healthcare</strong> <br> Thanks to the heroic efforts of the Epic CareConnect team and many others throughout the system, HHC recently rolled out the integrated system to their largest hospitals to great praise. The external consultants working with the organization, for example, remarked that it was one of the smoothest rollouts they had ever seen! And for Jennifer, Elise and their teams, they are gratified to have been able to do their part to make the future a reality and find ways to improve how such a large project could be accomplished going forward. <br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>Evans Kerrigan</strong>, a Certified Master-in-Training of The Leadership Challenge is a founder and Managing Partner of Integris Performance Advisors, a consulting company dedicated to increasing the existence of healthy organizations and great places to work.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> The world is experiencing a global leadership crisis and organizations in every industry—human services included—are feeling its effects. In fact, 89 percent of organizations say leadership is a top and pressing problem yet only a disproportionate few have a functioning leadership pipeline. One striking exception is <a href="http://www.leadingageindiana.org/" target="_blank">LeadingAge Indiana</a>, an organization that took action to get ahead of the crisis rather than fall victim to its consequences. <br> <br> LeadingAge Indiana, part of a nationwide association dedicated to making America a better place to grow old, is a membership organization of nonprofit providers of long term care, social services, and housing for the elderly in Indiana. It provides its members with education, group services, up-to-date information, networking, and leadership development, as well as prompt, efficient service for its professional staff. <br> <br> Like so many other organizations, LeadingAge was facing an exodus of experienced and knowledgeable leaders as growing numbers of Baby Boomers retired. And as the aging Baby Boom generation grew, the demand for elderly care was continuing to rise as well. Amidst this confluence of change, association leaders realized the urgency of examining the pipeline of leaders in the member organizations they support. They found that few had a bench of leaders who were ready to take the helm as experienced leaders retired. In addition, most organizations didn’t have the budget or capacity to implement in-house leadership development programs. <br> <br> <strong>A Proactive Approach to Get Ahead of a Leadership Crisis</strong> <br> In 2014, LeadingAge Indiana formed a task force to identify how other LeadingAge associations across the nation were supporting leader development with the goal of creating an industry-specific, leadership development program of its own. They looked at courses offered, training session frequency, program components (e.g., coaching), and content—specifically custom content versus purchased content. After finding considerable variability, they decided to base their program on a tried-and-true, research-based leadership model—The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®—supplemented by customized program components. With over 30 years of research and validated across multiple industries (including healthcare) and countries around the world, The Leadership Challenge now serves as the foundation for all of the associations’ efforts to develop the next generation of LeadingAge Indiana leaders. <br> <br> <strong>Program Goals</strong> <br> The task force began its work by crafting high-level goals for the program that would serve to elevate individual leaders, their organizations, and result in better care for the seniors they serve. Incorporating insights they learned from their research, including interviews with leaders in senior care organizations across the state of Indiana, they identified the following: <br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Inspire a passion for personal and professional development (e.g., lifelong learning)&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>Develop individual leadership skills&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>Elevate the performance and service levels of participating organizations&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>Deepen peer connections and networks across the association&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>Increase the number of potential successors within the association and industry&nbsp;</li> 
               </ul> <strong>A Powerful Partnership</strong> <br> To accomplish the above goals, LeadingAge Indiana looked to FlashPoint to help custom-design a multifaceted, highly interactive nine-month leadership development program, LEADERSHIPVIP, based on the two-day The Leadership Challenge® Workshop. After a rigorous and selective application process—including a resume, essays about their leadership and commitment to aging and human services, two letters of professional reference, and a commitment form—I had the pleasure of taking 27 current and emerging leaders from 16 organizations in Indiana’s human services industry through the LEADERSHIPVIP Program. Organizations represented included those focused on a specific aspect of senior care (e.g. dementia support) as well as those providing a full continuum of services (e.g., independent and assisted living as well as dementia support). <br> <br> Program components included: <br> 
               <ul> 
                <li><strong>Pre- and Post-360-Degree Competency Assessments:</strong> We used the LPI®: Leadership Practices Inventory® to determine how frequently leaders demonstrate the 30 leadership behaviors associated with The Five Practices, and to identify development opportunities for each participant.&nbsp;</li> 
                <li><strong>Individual and Group Coaching Sessions:</strong> Offering participating leaders the opportunity for personalized guidance, we were able to work with them one-to-one to interpret their LPI assessment results, create individual development plans, focus on goals, and refine their leadership visions. Group coaching then provided leaders an opportunity for a shared experience and to inspire fellow learners as they all worked toward fulfilling their visions and accomplishing their goals.&nbsp;</li> 
                <li><strong>Classroom and Virtual Learning Sessions:</strong> Leaders learned about The Five Practices over four half-day classroom sessions spaced four to six weeks apart. They engaged in a variety of activities and exercises to develop their leadership skills and build strong relationships with their peers. Between classroom sessions, virtual webinars were conducted via Adobe Connect, allowing participants the opportunity to share their successes and challenges as they worked to apply The Five Practices back on the job. In addition, we incorporated a variety of supporting materials from The Leadership Challenge library available on the website 
                 <www.leadershipchallenge.com>
                  , The Leadership Challenge® Practice Book 
                  <http:>
                   , etc. to help leaders delve even deeper into the Practice areas discussed during the classroom sessions.&nbsp;

               </ul> <strong>Measured Success, Lasting Impact</strong> <br> Over the nine months we spent together—in coaching calls and in-person sessions—I heard truly inspiring stories about how these leaders were applying what they were learning to improve their leadership and the lives of the people they serve. I saw every participant demonstrate greater competence, increased confidence, and a passion for the visions they created for themselves and their organizations. As one leader put it, “This was an amazing journey for me. I benefited in so many ways. I gained a lot more confidence as a leader!” But leaders aren’t the only ones who benefit from leadership training. We know that when leaders are competent and confident they also are able to develop competent and confident followers. And when employees feel competent, confident, valued, and supported they are much more willing to give of themselves. Participants’ team members became more engaged and demonstrated deeper commitment to and ownership of personal and team results. In the end, they also began demonstrating more empathy, care, and concern for the elderly people they serve. <br> <br> <strong>Program Metrics Measure Success</strong> <br> In addition to the many stories leaders shared and the way in which teams responded with heightened engagement and commitment to the mission, our program metrics also clearly demonstrate the powerful impact this LEADERSHIPVIP program has had. A follow-up LPI, administered nine months after the conclusion of the program, indicate that:<br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>&nbsp;75% of program participants improved in all Five Practices, on-average by 6.9%, with Inspire a Shared Vision increasing by 9.2%. Managers, too, reported increases across all Five Practice areas—by 15.2%.&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>Direct reports reported observing increases in positive leadership behaviors across all Five Practice areas by 9.0%.&nbsp;</li> 
               </ul> At the 18-month mark after the program had concluded, 16 percent of participants had been promoted or moved into positions of greater responsibility. <br> <br> <strong>Benefiting Individuals, Teams, Organizations, and Communities</strong> <br> In addition to individual leaders and teams, organizations that invest in leadership development also benefit. By building a reputation for having engaged employees and committed leaders, they can leverage that reputation to build a strong employment brand. In healthcare, this is especially relevant because a strong employment brand is a significant competitive advantage in an industry that is already experiencing a shortage of qualified talent. <br> <br> When leaders grow, employees are engaged, the business is operating to its potential, and the industry overall benefits as well. As a result of the LEADERSHIPVIP program, the human services industry throughout Indiana has experienced a pay-it-forward effect of leadership development as leaders from 16 different organizations now speak a common leadership language and practice a common set of leadership behaviors that are based on world-class The Five Practices leadership model. And each year, as new people participate, the population of exemplary leaders in the human services industry will grow; and, that will lead to ever improving care and services for the elderly in Indiana. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Bill Mugavin</strong>, CPLP and a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge, is a consultant at FlashPoint, a Global Training Partner of The Leadership Challenge committed to ensuring that leaders truly learn practical skills and improve leadership effectiveness—and that the organizations they serve see a strong return on investment.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>“What a great opportunity to share learning and support each other moving forward. The Leadership Challenge® program exceeded my expectations.”—Chief Marketing Officer, Cincinnati Nonprofit</p> <p>For the past four years, I’ve had the honor of offering The Leadership Challenge® Workshop to members of the nonprofit community in Cincinnati. Each time, I’ve come away more grateful and more inspired for having had the chance to share my time and expertise with such giving and generous leaders who work in service of others. And this year’s Masters Give Back experience, for me, was no exception. <br> <br> Twenty-one eager and excited participants from several nonprofit human services agencies joined us at our venue, Camp Joy, for the 2016 workshop event. And like years past, our all-inclusive, residential program included some challenging and memorable outdoor experiential activities along with engaging classroom learning of The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. Not even buckets of rain the first day could dampen the enthusiasm of the group. They engaged each other in meaningful conversation, deeply explored their LPI® feedback, and offered advice, counsel, and coaching to each other throughout the session. And they may have reached a new high in presenting recognitions to each other, based on how often we needed to re-supply the awards table. <br> <br> As I reflect back on this most recent Leadership Challenge program and the leaders who shared in this experience with me, the expression “wants to struggle” is what resonates. Our participants have really hard jobs. They provide programs and assistance for the aged, orphans, distressed families, the infirm, the disabled, and those seeking work who are frequently pigeon-holed as unqualified. They struggle with finding and keeping good people, and finding the resources to do what needs to be done. And yet, in spite of the difficulty of their jobs—or perhaps because of it!—every single leader who came to the workshop truly wanted to be there. They wanted to learn to be better leaders and to challenge themselves. They wanted to make every other leader in the room better, too. And yes, they struggled. Many spent an unusual amount of time exploring new and uncomfortable territory while working on their personal visions. They stretched their beliefs about themselves, shattering false limitations they held about their capabilities. And they reached out to build new and deep relationships, which for many is never as simple as it sounds. <br> <br> Nearly 30 years ago when work with The Leadership Challenge first began, we would ask workshop participants to imagine if all of their people were volunteers what would they need to do, as leaders, to get them to bring their hearts, souls, minds, and spirits to work. How would they motivate others to show up every day and work hard and long for a cause or a customer if there were no paychecks, benefits, offices, and other perks? Inspiring volunteers to want to struggle with you—and for you—is still one of the best tests of genuine leadership. And our nonprofit leaders grasp and model this core concept of leadership far more than most. <br> <br> This year’s group of participating leaders praised the experience and expressed gratitude for all that they learned. What they may never realize is how much I and everyone who participated in delivering this program ended up learning about leadership from all of them. In fact, a story shared by one leader truly speaks to why I consider my ability to offer this program such a gift, and also validates the work that all of us in The Leadership Challenge community do. This leader shared that when his executive director returned from the previous year’s program, she came back a changed person—both in the way she worked with people and in the way she led. He went on to say how lucky and privileged he was to have her as his boss and friend. He was also very grateful that she was giving him and a few of his colleagues the chance to change their lives as well, in this year’s session. <br> <br> In the end, it seems to me that this is the most valuable lesson of all: that leadership <strong>does</strong> make a difference. <br> <br> P.S. A rousing thank you to everyone at Wiley who continues to support the Masters Give Back program. You are making a real difference in the Cincinnati community—for the aspiring leaders in our nonprofit agencies and especially for those in need whom they serve. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Steve Coats</strong>, Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge, is managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a leadership development education and consulting firm.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Do you have what it takes to become a pioneering thought leader who can create an ideas revolution? “Lots of people write books, do a TED talk, give speeches…but the thought leaders who actually shake us up, who create new ways of thinking, who are founders of major enduring movements…those are more rare,” writes Debra Hunter, former president of Jossey-Bass and Pfeiffer, imprints of Wiley, and now an independent consultant coaching CEOs and working with executive teams on everything from strategic planning to mergers and acquisitions.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>We are fascinated by stories of victory against all odds. We love tales of good over evil and take delight in seeing the underdog come out on top. We are inspired when we see “mere mortals” accomplish more than anyone can reasonably expect. And, we love to see people succeed without compromising their truth and integrity. <br> <br> The recent Olympics in Rio, like prior games, gave us a front-row seat for just such experiences, showcasing teamwork and individual achievement at levels that far exceed the expectations we typically set for “normal” people. In fact, there is always something very special about the Olympics that excites our own potential. And one Olympic event in particular, the games of 1936, I still find remarkable when I consider all that was achieved in spite of the greatest of odds. <br> <br> A few years ago I read the book <em></em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boys-Boat-Americans-Berlin-Olympics/dp/0143125478" target="_blank"><em>Boys in the Boat</em>&nbsp;</a>and shared my impressions in an issue of this newsletter. In it I wrote that although the author, Daniel James Brown, may not have intended to write a leadership book about The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®, in telling this incredible Personal Best story it worked out that way. And now we all have the opportunity to revisit this inspiring tale of how challenging, modeling, inspiring, encouraging, and enabling propelled one scrappy eight-man team of rowers out of the University of Washington to Olympic Gold in Hitler’s Berlin.<br> <br> Inspired by Brown’s book, the Weinstein Company is said to be planning to release a new movie about this 1936 Olympic team that will help us continue to celebrate human potential, highlighting the joyful experience of achievement that only comes from accomplishing something that is “impossible.” And if you don’t want to wait for the movie, a fascinating documentary, The Boys of ’36, aired recently as part of PBS’ American Experience series and can be viewed online at <a href="http://www.pbs.org/video/2365812690/" target="_blank">pbs.org</a>
                <http:>
                 . 
                 <br> 
                 <br> What I love about this story is no doubt true for others as well: we love to see people win when we believe that they 
                 <em>deserve </em>to win. This is especially true of the eight-man crew that won the Gold Medal in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Team USA was comprised of young men who had been raised in poverty, men who had been—quite literally—“thrown away” by families. In general, these young men were very different from the privileged and wealthy athletes that dominated the sport. This team did not take steroids. Wealth did not “buy” anyone a seat on the team. They did not use illegal equipment. They did not sabotage their competitors. 
                 <br> 
                 <br> In addition, the global backdrop for our Boys in the Boat is important to understand in order to fully appreciate all that they achieved. In 1936, the United States was still entrenched in an economic depression. Stalin’s Great Purge had begun. West China was in famine. Most importantly, Hitler’s Germany had violated the Treaty of Versailles, while the world watched, and the 1936 Berlin Olympics had been designed as a skillfully crafted propaganda event to showcase the global superiority of Nazi Germany and the Aryan people. 
                 <br> 
                 <br> Yet in spite of some very steep odds, in front of Hitler and the world, our USA eight-oar crew beat Germany and all competitors in an intense and very close race. Their victory in Berlin demonstrated that leadership and integrity, the ability to overcome conflict, and a commitment to a greater good were key factors for success in the Olympics and beyond. In essence, The Five Practices were central to their success. 
                 <br>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">As a leadership coach, leadership presence and resilience have always been my interest. And recently, this really hit home as I walked the battlefields of Gettysburg with a Brigadier General from the U.S. Army War College.&nbsp;I was there to deliver The Leadership Challenge® Workshop to a group of executives, with the General adding the history about this very decisive and divisive Civil War battle. As we talked about all that happened on that sacred ground so many years ago, the leadership lessons became evident.&nbsp; </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">It is clear that the generals and other corps commanders did not fight the Battle of Gettysburg alone. 150,000 men marched on those fields in three days; 50,000 lost their lives. So, the question I came to consider was this: “What were the qualities these military leaders exhibited that inspired this kind of incredible commitment? How were all those brave soldiers motivated to keep fighting—even willing to die?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">In our world of leadership development, Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner, authors of&nbsp;<em>The Leadership Challenge</em>, address this question of inspired commitment when they describe effective leaders as those who we would “willingly follow.” And from the lessons I learned about the Battle at Gettysburg that day, here are some thoughts about what each of as leaders might do to engender the kind of followership we need to make extraordinary things happen in our own personal “battlefields”—in our work, in our lives. <br> <br> </span></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Inspire with a clear vision.</span><br> </strong></p> 
               <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"> 
                <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">“Stand firm, you men from Maine. Only once in a century will you bear such responsibility for freedom and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">justice, for&nbsp;God and humanity placed upon you...,” shouted Colonel Joshua Chamberlain as he faced the challenge&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">of motivating his&nbsp;beleaguered band of scared, injured, and bone-tired men to carry out a third assault on a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">battleground already littered&nbsp;with the bodies of dead comrades.</span></p> 
               </blockquote> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">As practitioners of The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®, we know that truly effective leaders take responsibility for creating a clear and compelling vision. But to motivate others to “enlist” in our pursuit, that vision must touch the emotions of those who will follow. Learning how to inspire through a common vision takes practice. Leaders can seek out feedback from trusted colleagues to get better at putting emotion and imagery into their visions. We can routinely ask, “Why would my audience want to get on board&nbsp;with this vision? How do I know they are getting what they need to be inspired?”<br> </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;"><br> <br> <strong>Are you delegating a task or are you delegating authority?</strong></span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">One of the most criticized decisions of the Battle of Gettysburg—a decision involving the attempt to take two important hills—was the result of what was clearly a miscommunication between General Robert E. Lee and General Richard Ewell. Instead of a firm and clear directive for how General Lee wished General Ewell to act, Lee used the phrase “if practicable.” General Ewell interpreted this hedge as giving him the authority to make his own determination. Unfortunately, the urgency and seriousness of Lee’s request was not clearly conveyed. In fact, his choice of words turned out to be a serious misjudgment that resulted in the loss of lives and set a different course for the battle.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Cultivating effective delegation skills is a crucial leadership competency. First and foremost, leaders must be clear about whether they just want a task done or whether they are actually delegating the authority to discern or change course, if needed. Before delegating or giving even a simple directive, leaders should pause and consider whether authority is being delegated. Ask yourself, “What information, clarification, and support can I give to ensure that my constituent has clarity about what is being delegated? How can I reinforce his or her role in a successful outcome?<br> </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;"><br> <br> <strong>Be flexible in the moment.</strong></span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Each of the Gettysburg leaders had their own style, to be sure. But more than style, it was their behavior in the moment that determined whether an engagement was successful or not. The “fog of war” demands flexibility and adaptability by both leaders and followers. Communicating in the moment is a complex task requiring not only a clear vision but important decisions about what and how much to communicate to those seeking direction.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">All of us, as leaders, can start to create flexibility by honing our response/reactivity skills. For example, create scenarios about critical incidents and “what if” situations to practice forecasting and imagining what would be said and what actions would/should be taken. Think about what values you rely on to frame critical communication and directives? Review those times when a quick analysis and decision was required. What can you learn from your actions and the ultimate outcome? Ask for feedback from those involved to gain their perspective.<br> </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;"><br> <br> <strong>Enable, coach, and Encourage the Heart.</strong></span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Stories abound about how the Gettysburg leaders created instant relationships with their men. To follow a leader in any circumstance—especially under the most arduous situations—requires a humanistic connection. Respectful nicknames were common during this battle.&nbsp;General Lee called General Longstreet his “old war-horse,” reinforcing the need for his loyalty and acknowledging his competence and commitment. Even when critical missteps were encountered, leaders shared accountability, told stories about what worked, and encouraged “the next success.” Like those at Gettysburg, leaders today have plenty of opportunities to assess their relationships and connection styles. We can practice our “inquiry” skills to quickly learn how and what our constituents think. And instead of “telling,” we can all be better served when we take a short period of time to listen and inquire.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">On the battlefield, as in the workplace, the common thread that weaves through effective leadership is relationships. Whether building immediate or enduring connections, the words and actions of leaders have a profound influence on those willing to follow and those willing to be a part of an ongoing drive for success. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-family: calibri;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Take up the challenge, leaders.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Leaders often fear the exposure and vulnerability that come with direct and honest feedback. However, the best leaders are those who are willing to hear what’s going on with others. That’s why it is so very important to pay close attention to item #16 of the Leadership Practices Inventory® (LPI®): I ask for feedback on how my actions affect other people’s performance. Having one or more practice activities that you engage in on a daily basis will go a long way to improve the frequency of this essential leadership behavior and, as a result, improve your effectiveness as a leader.<strong><br> </strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;"><strong><br> </strong>Begin today getting comfortable with honest dialogue by engaging at least one team member or constituent in conversation for feedback. Reflect on that experience at the end of the day and write down your responses to the following:<span style="text-transform: uppercase; color: #0f8498;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri; color: #0f8498;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
               <ol> 
                <li>Describe the conversation and feedback you received.</li> 
                <li>How will this feedback improve your performance as a leader?</li> 
                <li>How will it improve the performance of the team member or constituent? </li> 
               </ol> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">For an additional online activity, use the instant feedback of Twitter to build your feedback experience. Consider setting up a Twitter account for an appropriate project or initiative. Then ask your team members or constituents to report developments, react to ideas, and post suggestions online. Remember that leadership is a dialogue, not a monologue. </span></p> <p> </p> <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Adapted from The <em>Leadership Challenge® Practice Book, </em>James M.

(MTL) has been a pioneer in the growth of the container terminal industry in Hong Kong and Mainland China since 1972. Now one of the world’s recognized leaders, it is an organization heralded for its innovation, its strong customer-oriented focus on developing solutions that match the needs and business initiatives of its customers, and its commitment to continuously improving the efficiency and productivity of its people and processes. A key component of that continuous improvement focus is leadership development. Indeed, a </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">central belief sees leadership behavior as one of the key drivers of company culture, together with people programs, policies, and organizational structure. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">And for nearly 2 years, MTL has incorporated The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® as a core element of its comprehensive push to create a leader-based culture, bringing together </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">140 leaders to experience the power of The Leadership Challenge through training, coaching, and follow-up. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> </span> </p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Aligning Values and Leadership Behaviors</span></strong></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">When it came time to conduct its strategic review a few years ago, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">the organization took action to revisit its vision, mission, strategies, brand promises, and culture values. Senior management felt that it was very important that the cultural values be the guiding principles and foundation for everything they did, and that the leadership team live by and lead with a set of leadership behaviors that reinforced and embedded those cultural values.&nbsp; According to Theresa Lai, General Manager, Human Resources at MTL, “</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">When w</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">e began our search for leadership training for this purpose we found The Leadership Challenge®</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">.” </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Theresa and her team mapped the organization’s core values and corresponding leadership behaviors with the leadership behaviors of each of The Five Practices. There was such close alignment that the decision to embrace and adopt The Leadership Challenge was an easy one. After a successful pilot with the HR leadership team, a full two-day The Leadership Challenge® Workshop offering was launched with the top executive team and rolled out to top leaders in various business units shortly thereafter. </span></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;"><br> Engaging the HR team in formulating a new vision </span></strong> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">The Leadership Challenge training was inspiring for all of MTL’s leaders, especially for Theresa Lai. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">As she considered each of The Five Practices, she saw how the behaviors and principles around Inspire a Shared Vision could be used to create an even more engaged HR team. In particular, she saw how this Practice could be used to enlist her HR team in creating a common vision. And she knew the forum she would use to put this new process to the test.&nbsp; </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Each year, the HR team </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">holds </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">annual review meetings </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">to Challenge the Process by asking two key </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">questions: <em>What are we doing right?</em> and <em>What could </em></span><em><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">we do differently to become an even </span></em><em><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">be</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">tter HR team</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">? </span></em><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Once her three direct reports had all completed their two-day workshop experience, Theresa called them together to </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">prepare for the full department’s visioning session to be conducted during their next annual review meeting. Theresa and her managers h</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">ad their own views about what they wanted the vision to look like and knew they could develop one in short order as a small leadership team. However, rather than developing and refining their vision </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">just among themselves</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">, they committed to making the vision process </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">an inclusive one for </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">the entire team.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">“</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">One of the challenges we faced was how to facilitate quality discussion around our team vision with the various levels of people on our team,” said Heidi Chow, Manager, Human Resource Development.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">“</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">We needed to make the process easily understandable so that all team members could participate. And we put a lot of effort into crafting well-thought-out questions for this purpose.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">”</span> </p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">The full HR team visioning session began with important discussions around: </span></p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Emerging trends influencing how the work of the department gets done</li> 
                <li>What MTL wanted to be as an employer</li> 
                <li>What kind of HR role the team wanted to play</li> 
                <li>What kind of an HR team they wanted to be when it came to delivering services to internal and external stakeholders</li> 
               </ul> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">All participants were asked to think high-level—as a team, as part of the larger organization—rather than focusing on their individual team roles. They were encouraged to consider all areas of their work for their input and ideas and, most importantly, to share their dreams for the future.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">“We always believed that people would have a stronger sense of purpose and achievement when they are enlisted in creating a common vision, which is the key reason why we involved all 18 of our HR members in this visioning process,” explained Theresa. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">“The creativity and the quality of new thinking </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">were </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">impress</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">ive.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">” </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">And most importantly, the full team felt that they had been heard. “We talked about the kind of employer we wanted to become and the workforce we wanted to build, HR’s role in promoting continuous improvement, and how we wanted to function as a team” In the end, these collaborative efforts created a shared vision that today reads:&nbsp; </span> </p> 
               <blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"> 
                <p><em><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">HR is a strategic partner to the business. </span></em><em><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">We are a committed and professional team which contributes to making MTL an employer of choice.<br> <br> </span></em></p> 
               </blockquote> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Leveraging the team’s shared vision to create an increasingly engaged team</span></strong><em> </em></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">That very first visioning session served as a catalyst for more brainstorming, more discussions, and more actions that have been instrumental in putting into action the team’s common vision.&nbsp; </span><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Cheer</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">-</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Me</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">-</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Up Stations</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">, for example, started small. They initially were set up as kiosks, once every other month in different MTL work locations where people could come to get healthy snacks and drinks. Staffed by members of the HR Employee Relations team around shift-change times, operations employees (many of whom do not have work computers) could learn about </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">sports and recreational activities, volunteer work opportunities, staff benefits, policy changes, pay adjustments and bonuses</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">, and more. The HR Employee Relations team also took the time to ask employees how they were doing—to provide an opportunity just to talk</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">—and received very useful feedback regarding changes in company policies, ways in which HR could be of more assistance, etc. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Six months after the initial launch, Cheer-Me-Up stations now are set up twice each month as a result of suggestions from HR team members during the ‘realizing our vision’ discussions. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Other HR team members outside of the Employee Relations unit now participate as well, welcoming MTL employees to a </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Cheer-Me-Up station 20 times a year. </span> </p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;"><br> Walking the talk of The Five Practices</span></strong></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">The Five Practices are now deeply-rooted in the culture of the organization and, specifically, in the behaviors of its HR leaders. As Theresa explains it, “For a while I reviewed The Five Practices every day…then every week…then every month. I don’t consciously think about them quite the same way anymore. Now they are just part of </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">my</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;"> DNA.”&nbsp; And as a high-functioning, productive and cohesive team, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">the deep-rooted nature of The Five Practices is also evidenced in the increased engagement of the larger HR team and the various ways in which they have brought each of the Practices to life: </span> </p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong> </strong></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Model the Way</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">: The HR Leadership Team has consistently followed through on the actions they said were important to build MTL as the employer of choice—including the Cheer-Me-Up initiative. They did what they said they would do (DWYSYWD).</span> </p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong> </strong></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Inspire a Shared Vision</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">: The learning of this Practice inspired Theresa Lai to hold multiple visioning sessions, inviting all team members to participate in crafting the overall vision and providing a forum for all voices to be heard.</span> </p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong> </strong></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Challenge the Process</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">: While regular review meetings are standard as a way of engaging the team in finding new ways to improve their work, incorporating the learnings of The Leadership Challenge has reinforced the importance of Challenging the Process for the team—to take the initiative to innovate and experiment.&nbsp; </span></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong> </strong></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Enable Others to Act</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">: Fostering collaboration, building trust, facilitating relationships, actively listening to all points of view. HR leadership did an exemplary job of involving all 18 members of the HR staff in the process of generating ideas on how to achieve the vision.&nbsp; </span></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong> </strong></p> <p style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Encourage the Heart:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;"> They recognized team members by agreeing to do what they proposed, and supported the initiatives by actively participating in those activities. HR managers use the monthly meetings of the whole HR team to recognize efforts of team members in projects or for just going the extra mile. </span> </p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Creativity and innovation have continued to flourish within the HR units at MTL over the past 18 months. In part this is a result of the exemplary leadership the HR Leadership Team modeled so that others could follow. It is also due to how fully the team embraced the Practice of Enabling Others to Act that resulted in the creation of their powerful vision that is driving positive organizational change and engagement. <br> <br> </span></p> <p class="s2" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><strong> </strong></p> <p class="s2" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">Terence Yeung</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;">, Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge,</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri;"> has led TACSEN<span style="background-color: white;"> Management Consultants Limited, a Global Training Partner of<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>The Leadership Challenge</em>,</span> to become the only training company elected “Hong Kong’s Most Valuable Company” in 2012.&nbsp; As Managing Director of TACSEN,<span style="background-color: white;"> he has helped numerous multinational clients in Hong Kong and China enhance their leadership capabilities.

But after a few short weeks, I came to the conclusion I had made a financial blunder in buying it. I still very much wanted to play the piano, but I discovered that I did not want to <i>learn</i> to play the piano!</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">As I’ve reflected back on my experience at The Leadership Challenge Forum 2016 in Nashville last month, I was reminded of my piano—the desire to play but not necessarily to learn. You see, programming for the Forum this year focused on “learning leadership”, the theme of Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner’s newly released book by the same name. And nearly 200 people came to this wonderful and downright enjoyable learning experience to find out more about what it really means to “learn” to lead.&nbsp; </span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">From the opening session to the last, I believe that most attendees would agree it was all very much about learning—about the meaning and heart of The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®, about the opportunity for continuous learning the Forum provided, and so much more.&nbsp; </span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">Authors Jim and Barry, once again, Modeled the Way of lifelong learning and generous sharing as they kicked off the two-day event with&nbsp; key insights from their new book, <i>Learning Leadership</i>, that set the stage for beginning to rethink how leaders truly learn to lead and the exciting breakout sessions to come.&nbsp; I also made note of something much more subtle that I will remember perhaps more than their opening session comments. What really struck me was Jim and Barry’s full and complete engagement throughout the Forum. As they attended the numerous breakout sessions, for example, they didn’t sit in the back of the room checking email or phone messages. They were present, engaged, and contributing. They asked questions. They participated in discussions. And they offered their experience and knowledge freely to all. In our constantly buzzing, chirping, pinging, ringing, and vibrating world of 24/7 access, we should all be mindful of the powerful messages we send, when we remain present and focused on the people at hand. Thanks guys for the clear reminder.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">One of the keynote speakers, Dr. Samineh Shaheem, also reminded us of something that’s so very critical to learning, to being more effective as leaders, to becoming all that we can be: how important it is to examine our past programming and limiting beliefs. Leaders recognize that Challenge the Process is as much about challenging oneself internally (e.g., how I have always done things, drawn conclusions, or determined my beliefs) as it is about challenging external organizational processes (e.g., how to improve onboarding or product development). And it seems there will always be an abundance of iron clad rules, routines, and personal beliefs conspiring to keep the status quo in place. That is why we need leaders to challenge the way things are done.&nbsp; </span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">Even in our everyday life experiences we are confronted with these iron clad “rules”. For example, at the Forum’s Thursday reception I picked up a small plate of the Caesar salad (vs. the fruit salad). When I attempted to put the raspberry vinaigrette on it, I was told by the server that ‘Caesar dressing goes on the Caesar salad, raspberry on the fruit salad’.&nbsp; Unfortunately for many, “the way it has always been done” is often and incorrectly translated into “the only way it can be done.” (BTW… the raspberry was delicious on the Caesar!)</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">One of the most enjoyable parts of this year’s Forum was to see how much the Community truly practices Enable Others to Act and Encourage the Heart.&nbsp; There were a total of 26 breakout sessions, facilitated by practitioners from around the globe who openly shared their talents, experiences, and stories to help everyone in attendance learn to lead more effectively. It was such a great example of mass collaboration and the collective desire to help everyone grow. There was, as always, an enormous amount of genuine and well-deserved praise and recognition provided. I heard a number of people specifically use the word “encouraging” to describe their Forum experiences. And one very important thing that attendees learned (or re-learned) was how vital encouragement is in creating an environment for extraordinary achievements to occur.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">And considering how important well-deserved praise and recognition is to building a collaborative community, there’s a special shout-out I’d like to make here. As many of us who are part of The Leadership Challenge Community know, a shared vision is different than a big, ambitious goal. Whether working with individual leaders or with teams, defining what a “shared vision” will look like is part of the process. And so it was for the&nbsp; Forum 2016 planning team who had a dream that a couple of hundred people would gather together, bump into long-time friends and meet new ones, enthusiastically share their talents and support of others, and devote themselves to the hard work of learning leadership. For those of us fortunate to be at this year’s Forum, we got to see that big dream become a reality. It was truly inspiring to see our community come together around an inspiring vision and to know that many of us will be taking the dream forward,&nbsp; inspiring our colleagues and clients to share in it as well. Bravo to everyone at Wiley and elsewhere for their tireless work to bring that big vision to life in such a meaningful and rewarding way. </span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">And now, two last quick reflections about this year’s learning experience at the Forum.&nbsp; I was thinking back on the presentation by keynote speaker Keni Thomas, one of the leaders of the 3rd Ranger Battalion immortalized in the book and movie, <i>Blackhawk Down</i>. The overarching message of his keynote was that leadership is all about the example you set. And it occurred to me that there is a difference between an extraordinary storyteller and someone who changes lives. People may forget Keni’s name in a few weeks but they will never forget him.&nbsp; Nor will they forget the lessons he shared, about standing the line and never leaving anyone behind, especially those who might appear to be a little slower or more challenged in their learning. Thank you for your service Keni, not only on the battlefield but for all the people in the world you continue to touch and inspire.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">And finally... with almost 30 years of Leadership Challenge experience, there were many moments at the conference when I felt overwhelmed, perhaps even a bit inadequate. I cannot recall how many times I found myself saying, “I never thought about that,” or “Wow, how did you ever come up with such a clever thing to do!” My guess is many of my fellow attendees shared those sentiments. </span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">All that being said…there is little I find more joyful and inspiring than being around really smart and creative people who are graciously willing to teach, coach, mentor and yes, be good friends. Thanks to all for creating a stimulating and rewarding learning environment. </span></p> <p><b></b></p> <p><b><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;"><em>Steve Coats, </em></span></b><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;"><em>Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge, is managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a leadership development education and consulting firm.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p class="MsoNormal" style="vertical-align: baseline;"><strong><em>Save the Tiger</em>: Have you found meaning in your work?</strong><br> &nbsp;<br> <br> “What do you want, Harry?”<br> “What do I want? Another season.”— Harry Stoner, <em>Save the Tiger</em>&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> <em></em><a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/save-the-tiger-1973"><em>Save the Tiger</em></a>&nbsp;is a 1973 film about moral conflict in contemporary America. Harry Stoner, the main protagonist played by Academy Award-winning actor Jack Lemmon, is successful by most external measures yet is on the edge of ruin as he struggles to find significance, inspiration, and meaning in his life. He wants more than just to survive. Indeed, he wants to be in love with something. “Anything,” he says. “An idea. A dog. A cat…something!” But when asked, “What do you want, Harry?” his only response is, “What do I want? &nbsp;Another season.”<br> <br> <br> Over the years, practitioners of The Leadership Challenge® have consistently found that the Practice both new and experienced leaders find most difficult to master is Inspire a Shared Vision. At the same time, it’s been found that this is also the Practice many people feel most distinguishes a “leader” from simply another “trusted associate.” Clearly, the ability to inspire is critical to leadership. &nbsp;But, what exactly does it take &nbsp;to inspire with a compelling, shared vision? What does that look like?&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> As practitioners of The Leadership Challenge, we describe it as “Envisioning the future by imagining exciting and ennobling possibilities” and “Enlisting others in a common vision by appealing to shared aspirations.” However, before anyone can envision “exciting” or “ennobling” possibilities in their work they first have to be able to see meaning in their work. &nbsp;They have to be able to articulate to others what the meaning is in the work that they do. Think of this as one of the first steps on the path to having a vision.<br> <br> <br> Part of experiencing The Leadership Challenge is receiving feedback via the highly-validated, 360-degree LPI®: Leadership Practices Inventory®. And one of the behaviors the LPI measures which demonstrates the ability to inspire is “Speaks with conviction about the meaning of work.” But how many of us can do that? &nbsp;How many of us, if pressed like Harry Stoner, could only answer the question, “What do you want?” with “Another season.”?<br> <br> <br> If you were asked what you want for your team, your company, or your clients, &nbsp;what would you answer: Another quarter? &nbsp;Another year? &nbsp;Another season?<br> <br> <br> Leaders in the world of business often have trouble being visionaries within their organizations—and that often is a result of an inability to see <em>meaning in their work</em>. If you can’t explain what your work means to you, you probably can’t explain it to anyone else either. If your work simply represents a paycheck, it will no doubt mean no more than that to the people who report to you.<br> <br> <br> I encourage you to find meaning in what you do. Don’t settle for wanting just “another season.” &nbsp;Seek work in which you find significance and purpose.&nbsp;<br> <br> <em><br> This article was originally published on</em> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/save-tiger-have-you-found-meaning-your-work-bruce-wilson">LinkedIn Pulse</a>.<br> <br> <br> Bruce Wilson is Vice-President of Business Development at FlashPoint, a Global Training Partner of The Leadership Challenge.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Leadership resilience is often associated with managing through incidents or change, yet leaders are met with challenges every day that can tap into their emotions, drain their energy, and redirect their attention.<br> <br> These common work stressors may include managing conflict, receiving unexpected news, or navigating ongoing technical change. Who hasn’t been kept awake at night with hijacked thoughts over seemingly mundane issues?<br> <br> There are a number of capabilities that leaders can cultivate that will serve as a foundation to manage and cope effectively with these everyday challenges. It turns out that building resilience is a combination of the brain and the heart.<br> <br> Here are some findings that can help leaders develop resilience:<br> 
               <ol> 
                <li>Don't ignore the negative: Resilient leaders see negatives and risks, but they don’t dwell there. They are actively aware, but filter out negativity by reframing issues in a more proactive direction.<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>Face the fear: Most leaders have some degree of fear and resistance to conflict. They can also be guilty of not wanting to look further, avoiding what may be revealed. Leaders who understand their fear and manage through it are more likely not to get emotionally derailed making decisions.<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>Be a realistic optimist: Effective leaders don’t always present the optimistic side. They adapt to bad things by understanding what they can control and what they can’t, knowing they have a choice in how to respond.<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>Cope actively: Resilient leaders read and identify their emotions, consciously suspending them as they explore facts. They look at all sides, including their own biases. This “cognitive re-appraisal” allows them to manage distracting emotions while they communicate and influence others.<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>Seek support: One of the most important findings in the science of resilience is having social support. Effective leaders are good listeners and supporters. They cultivate a safe and supportive network around them. Persistent venting and blaming of others has been shown to decrease resilience and serves as an important caveat. The key is in the balance.</li> 
               </ol> Leaders make space for important visioning and strategy, yet we are all human and get distracted with stressors that can sap us. Take a resilience audit and watch where your thoughts get hijacked throughout the day. Understanding how resilience is built day-by- day may help you focus on what matters, and you just might feel better, too.<br> <br> <strong>Holly Seaton</strong>, Ph.D. is a Coaching Practice Leader and The Leadership Challenge® Facilitator with Sonoma Leadership Systems.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> “Leadership development is self-development” and “Leadership requires deliberate practice”—two of the core concepts at the heart of The Leadership Challenge<sup>®</sup>. For over 35 years, these essential practices of exemplary leadership have helped shape the leadership development journey of adult participants in The Leadership Challenge Workshop, legions of readers of The Leadership Challenge, and anyone who has experienced the LPI<sup>®</sup> :Leadership Practices Inventory<sup>®</sup>. &nbsp;And with the introduction of The Student Leadership Challenge<sup>®</sup> some eight years ago, these same concepts of self-development and deliberate practice began to be introduced as guiding principles to college students as well.&nbsp;<br> <br> For many trainers and consultants helping people across the globe develop their capacity to lead, young adults and professionals already in the workforce— aspiring leaders and experienced veterans alike—have remained the focus of their leadership development efforts. A notable exception is Dr. Ghassan Al-Saddiki. Along with his colleagues in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, he had experienced great success using The Leadership Challenge <em>and</em> The Student Leadership Challenge in helping leaders on their journey, which prompted him to wonder, “When is the right time to begin learning about leadership? When we look around at the challenges that future generations face, are we starting soon enough to help young people understand and explore their capacity to make a difference in the world?” After much contemplation, the answer was clear: “We should start as early as we can and never stop.” And with that as his personal challenge, a non-profit organization was formed, the Benaa Educational Consulting Group, to address the need for creative leadership development opportunities for the young people of Saudi Arabia and throughout the Middle East.&nbsp;<br> <br> From the beginning, the group’s key goal was to build and support a “Culture of Leadership” using The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® as the foundation and the belief that Leadership is Everyone’s Business. Dr. Ghassan and his team of educators and leaders have creatively put the power of The Five Practices model to work in age-appropriate ways, ultimately creating a continuous path of leadership development opportunity for emerging leaders ages 5 through 26 and beyond.&nbsp;<br> <br>

               </ul> Flexibility, creativity, and a keen focus on the age-appropriate learning styles of children and youth have been the hallmarks of the work the Benaa Group has done. For example, the very first program the group developed was initially designed for Intermediate School students, ages 8-15 years old, to help them focus on their potential as leaders and the importance of giving back to their communities. With early lessons learned, great feedback, and the realization that so many changes take place between ages 8 and 15, the group ultimately created two separate programs, each with activities and customized content that was more targeted and age appropriate.&nbsp;<br> <br>

Their aim was to reach further—both up and down the age ladder—with leadership development opportunities that would help young leaders in Saudi Arabia prepare for their roles tomorrow. &nbsp;And the catalyst for their next venture returned them to a key component of their original mission: to start developing leaders as early as possible. That meant putting their creativity and passion for developing young people into tomorrow’s leaders into a program for the very young.<strong> I’m a Pioneer </strong>and <strong>My Values Raise Me Up</strong> were developed for both boys and girls, ages 5 – 7 years old, &nbsp;to explore their potential to help others and be leaders in their communities.&nbsp;<br> <br> Students in this program are encouraged to discover who they are and to develop visions of themselves as future community leaders.

All programs are grounded in a strong belief that young people must have time to discover who they are, what they value, what their strengths and skills are. They must have the time and support to discover what their commitment to leadership will be and in what ways they will give back and contribute to their communities. They also must have time to develop a meaningful career and a meaning personal life. And the Benaa Group makes this pathway clear to all who participate in its programs—students and faculty alike—so that everyone is aligned with a common vision of success. The group’s focus on continuous development includes its most recent efforts to develop a strong team of Certified Facilitators for both The Leadership Challenge and The Student Leadership Challenge who are dedicated to bringing The Five Practices into the organizations they serve throughout the Middle East with ongoing professional development opportunities for those just beginning, mid-way, or well established in their careers.&nbsp;<br> <br> The Benaa Group sees a compelling dream of the future—one where all people are given a clear path to explore and discover their innate capacity to lead and serve others—and it continues to be committed to building the bridges necessary to connect one opportunity to the next…to the next.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Beth High</strong> is President of HighRoad Consulting, an organizational consulting and program design company.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Twice through, I made the kind of connection that will stay with me for a long time. What I was reading was that good, that thought provoking. &nbsp;It demanded a second reading, and then a third with a highlighter. I'm referring to a <em>New York Times</em> Op-Ed column by David Brooks, titled <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/opinion/sunday/david-brooks-the-moral-bucket-list.html?_r=0" target="_blank">The Moral Bucket List</a></span>—a piece that was adapted from his 2015 book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Road-Character-David-Brooks/dp/081299325X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1456334155&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+road+to+character" target="_blank">The Road to Character</a>.</em><br> <br> Although this NYT piece was published nearly a year ago, I found it as current and relevant as ever. It captured my attention, challenged me, and forced me, once again, to consider the very personal and moral nature of leadership.<br> <br> But, back to the connection…I was just a few paragraphs in when a string of words jumped out at me and grabbed me by the collar: &nbsp;"I came to the conclusion,” Brooks reflected, “that wonderful people are made, not born—that the people I admired had achieved an unfakeable inner virtue, built slowly from specific moral and spiritual accomplishments.”&nbsp;<br> <br> “Has Brooks been reading <em>The Leadership Challenge</em>?”, I wondered to myself. &nbsp;I saw how clearly he was echoing some of the supporting truths of The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership<sup>®</sup> model. So, I read the piece again, this time through a leadership lens. And that’s when the connections all fell so fully into place, because what Brooks' "moral bucket list" was truly reminding me of was that the best leaders:<br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Are humble and "profoundly honest about their own weaknesses." &nbsp;</li> 
                <li>Build character and defeat their weaknesses through deliberate, life-long practice</li> 
                <li>Can't do it alone, especially when attempting to achieve self-mastery.</li> 
                <li>Have achieved a "settled philosophy about fundamental things" (yes, LPI® item #26).</li> 
                <li>Are energized by love (remember how Jim often closes his speeches, revealing the secret to success in life).</li> 
                <li>Are propelled by conscience. As Brooks describes, "feel fulfilled only when they are enmeshed in a struggle on behalf of some ideal." Jim and Barry's notion that "challenge is the crucible for greatness" supports this point. . .or even their definition of leadership: “The art of mobilizing others to want to struggle for shared aspirations.”&nbsp;</li> 
               </ul> There are more highlights, but read the piece for yourself and make your own connections. While David Brooks is often known as a political pundit, I promise this piece will provide a nice break from the mudslinging that seems to be filling our newspapers and airwaves during this campaign year. It may even motivate you to create your own leadership bucket list.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Lisa Shannon</strong> is currently Vice President and Director, Partner Channels at Wiley.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Want to be an outstanding leader? Keep a journal is the advice from Nancy Adler, McGill University professor and friend of The Leadership Challenge®. “Research has documented that outstanding leaders take time to reflect,” she writes in a recent <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/want-to-be-an-outstanding-leader-keep-a-journal?platform=hootsuite&amp;hootPostID=26cc895adc697368ab40a36edf68ed3e" target="_blank">Harvard Business Review article</a>. “But the reality is that most of us live such fast-paced, frenzied lives that we fail to leave time to actually listen to ourselves.” So what she provides here is a simple approach to carving out ample time to reflect and write, including trigger questions in case you get stuck, and suggestions on how to use art to help ignite your imagination.&nbsp;<br> <br> In addition to accolades Nancy has received as a researcher, consultant, and visual artist, her <a href="www.amazon.com/Leadership-Insight-Nancy-J-Adler/dp/0415877628/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453850700&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=nancy+adler " target="_blank"><em>Leadership Insight</em> journal</a> has won the praises of Jim Kouzes who called it “a magical work by an extraordinarily talented artist and highly respected scholar…<em>Leadership Insight</em> offers us a necessary and welcome bit of quiet space for reflection and contemplation. We know that the most self-aware leaders make the best leaders, and recording in this journal is the perfect way to gain more insight into yourself, your relationships, and your world.”<br>

And Jim gave us <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KouzesPosner/photos/pb.92727804851.-2207520000.1452125637./10154597504724852/?type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank">his best five</a>!&nbsp;<br> <br> 
               <ol> 
                <li>Because values drive commitment, the first thing a leader can give is a clear statement of the principles that guide our decisions and actions.&nbsp;<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>Communicate a compelling vision of the future, a picture of where we’ll be in 3 to 5 years from now.&nbsp;<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>Challenge is the crucible of greatness, so the third gift a leader can give is the freedom to search for opportunities to innovate and improve.&nbsp;<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>You can’t do it alone. Therefore, the fourth gift is trust. You can never take trust for granted. You have to work at it every day.&nbsp;<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>And finally, gratitude—the single best predictor of well-being—is the fifth gift a leader can give: the expression of gratitude for the contributions of others. &nbsp;</li>

They also received expert guidance provided by a dedicated FlashPoint team, including Master Facilitator LJ Rose, Certified Master-in-Training Holly Seaton, Graphics Facilitator John Ward, Sonoma’s LPI Administrator Nancy Peterson, and The Leadership Challenge Facilitator Raul Peña.&nbsp;<br> <br> Participants had opportunities to network with individuals from various nonprofits in the Sonoma Valley and, overall, everyone came away from the experience having found deep and meaningful takeaways that will enrich their lives going forward. &nbsp;<br> <br> Following the workshop, on-going email communication has kept all participants engaged. Regular cohort meetings provide an opportunity to continue discussions around their LPI feedback and action steps for moving their leadership development plan forward. The cohort also plans to meet regularly to address issues and concerns affecting the community, and explore ways to apply their new-found leadership skills to current challenges.&nbsp;<br> <br> There was an outpouring of community support for this very special Masters Give Back program, and to those who made such a difference we say, “thank you.” &nbsp;The Rotary Club of Sonoma Valley for the donated food and refreshments 
               <ul> 
                <li>La Luz Center donated the facility and ongoing meeting space</li> 
                <li>Carneros Brewing Company for the use of their facility for a first-evening gathering and ongoing meeting space</li> 
               </ul> The Masters Give Back program is an opportunity for facilitators of The Leadership Challenge to enrich the lives of individuals and communities, supported by the generosity of John Wiley and Sons. And we are confident that the outcome of this experience will be a continued interest and commitment to leadership from these new and aspiring leaders in the Latino community.&nbsp;<br> <strong><br> Jeni Nichols</strong> is President of FlashPoint, a Global Training Partner of The Leadership Challenge, where she leads a team of creative, experienced leadership development professionals in fulfilling the firm’s vision of developing a “well-led world, one leader at a time.” She can be reached at <a href="http://FlashPointLeadership.com" target="_blank">www.FlashPointLeadership.com</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <a href="www.laluzcenter.org" target="_blank"><br> <strong>La Luz Center</strong></a><strong></strong>, a Jefferson Foundation Award recipient, is a nonprofit and the only organization serving the Latino community in Sonoma, providing English language training, teaching computer skills, distributing food, hosting medical services, offering crisis counseling, and supporting events that celebrate the richness of the multicultural community. &nbsp;<br>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <em>The Leadership Challenge</em> continues to expand across the globe, changing the lives of leaders and their organizations. This is especially true throughout East Asia as leaders in business and industry are finding the power of The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership<sup>®</sup> essential to making extraordinary things happen. And for the very first time, thanks to the generosity of the team at Wiley, I and my colleagues at TACSEN had the good fortune to bring the rich experience of <em>The Leadership Challenge</em> to aspiring leaders in the Hong Kong nonprofit community— to bring corporate quality leadership training to those who could not afford it on their own. &nbsp;<br> <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Hong%20Kong-Participant%20Photo.jpg" longdesc="Participants in the first-ever Masters Give Back Program in Hong Kong" style="width: 300px; height: 198px; float: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">Together with our event co-sponsor, Social Enterprise Summit (SES), we recently welcomed 21 leaders from Hong Kong-based NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and not-for-profits at our inaugural Masters Give Back program. Participants came from a wide variety of social, religious, and charity organizations, including general managers, directors, and other senior leaders from SES (including its Chairman), Hong Kong Council of Social Service, Caritas–Hong Kong, Po Leung Kuk, Friends of Earth, The Hong Kong Society for the Blind, and Church Council. During our one-day workshop, we provided an overview of The Five Practices, guidance on how to interpret and get the most out of the feedback and insight contained in the Leadership Practices Inventory<sup>®</sup> (LPI<sup>®</sup>) report, and through exercises and in-depth discussion reviewed the key tools and concepts for each of The Five Practices.&nbsp;<br> <br> Insights and learnings were evident with everyone in the group. Many participants expressed gratitude for the opportunity to get to know other people from different NGOs, while others appreciated how practical and useful the content of the workshop was.&nbsp;<br> <br> In addition to the benefits participants received, our Masters Give Back program also provided a great learning opportunity for me. Being in the commercial sector my entire career, I now have a much deeper appreciation for the differences in how The Five Practices apply in for-profits vs non-profits. For example, I see how NGOs approach risk assessment and risk taking very differently from other commercial organizations I have encountered. As Jane Lee, Chairman of SES, explained, “An assessment of risk involving legal, social, and organizational reputation is usually considered <em>before</em> an assessment of financial risk in NGOs”. This represented a very different way of thinking about risk for me.&nbsp;<br> <br> This important first-ever Masters Give Back program provided the participating nonprofit leaders a chance to devote time to their own leadership; it also provided them with the opportunity to build community. I am happy and grateful that we were able to contribute to the Hong Kong community, and to engage with such inspiring leaders.<br> <br> <strong>Terence Yeung</strong>, a Certified Master-in-Training, is Managing Director of TACSEN Management Consultants Limited, a Global Training Partner of <em>The Leadership Challenge</em>.

Indeed, a common set of values is forged, not forced. It is built through process, not pronouncements. And everything a leader does impacts his or her ability to rally the organization around a common set of values. So, take action to Model the Way by using the personal, authentic delivery of a podcast to demonstrate commitment to shared values: &nbsp;<br>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <strong>Q: </strong>&nbsp;In working with a client to debrief the Leadership Practices Inventory® (LPI®), several leaders had questions about how the percentile ranking is calculated. &nbsp;Can you provide the background on this to help me explain?&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;As you know, the LPI has been extensively applied in many organizational settings—academia and government, healthcare and technology, non-profits and for-profits. In fact, it is one of the most widely used 360-degree leadership assessment instruments available. And for over 30 years now, my co-author Jim Kouzes and I have continuously gathered and analyzed LPI data for ongoing study and to make refinements to the instrument.&nbsp;<br> <br> We recently released a new report, <em><a href="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/Research-section-Our-Authors-Research-Detail/bringing-the-rigor-of-research-to-the-art-of-leadership.aspx" target="_blank">Bringing the Rigor of Research to the Art of Leadership</a></em>&nbsp;that reflects data gathered through December 2014 (including LPI Online data gathered since 2004). The current database includes responses from approximately 2.5 million individuals and is used to produce the normative information contained in the LPI Feedback Report and to calculate the percentile rankings.&nbsp;<br> <br> As the Percentile Ranking page of the LPI Feedback Report explains, the leaders and observers who make up the LPI database include a mix of males and females (approximately 55% male, 45% female). They come from all levels within all types of organizations and from 72 countries around the world. When debriefing the LPI with leaders then, what you are seeing is his or her results compared to what is now more than 2.5 million people who have completed the LPI: approximately 18% completed the LPI Self while 82% participated in the 360-degree feedback process as Observers. Among the LPI Observers, Managers account for 11.9%, Co-workers 32.0%, Direct Reports 26.1%, and the remaining identify themselves as Others. &nbsp;<br> <br> The percentile rankings are benchmarking numbers, determined by the percentage of people who scored at or below a given number. For example, say your leader’s Self score for Challenge the Process is at the 70th percentile line. It means that his or her score (use of the six behaviors) is higher in that Practice than 70 percent of all the scores in the database—in the top 30% for that Practice. And remember, this is not about percentages but, rather, about percentiles. It’s about where the leader’s score falls on the scale in comparison to other leaders in the database—NOT how many of the items associated with a particular Practice the leader got “right.”<br> <br> Regardless of job function, industry, hierarchical position, or geography—and despite possible individual differences of age, education, ethnicity, and gender—The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® have consistently been found by researchers to be related to positive employee and organizational outcomes, as measured and validated by the LPI. In addition to our own ongoing research, over 700 studies by other scholars and researchers have been conducted using the LPI as a research instrument and continue to confirm the relationship between The Five Practices and a variety of measurable outcomes such as job satisfaction, employee commitment, and sales performance. Because of the LPI's demonstrated psychometric properties—strong reliability and validity—educators and practitioners alike remain confident in using the LPI to further understand what it takes to be an effective leader.<br> <br> Barry Posner is the Accolti Endowed Professor of Leadership at the Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University, where he served as Dean for 12 years. Together with Jim Kouzes, he is author of The Leadership Challenge—now in its fifth edition—and over thirty other books and workbooks on leadership and leadership development.<br>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> I’ve been ruminating lately on one of the leadership fundamentals that <em>The Leadership Challenge</em>&nbsp;authors Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner have found in their research, which is simply this: leadership is a relationship. &nbsp;<br> <br> What makes our relationships, and thus, our leadership thrive? I find, both personally and professionally, that I am drawn to those people who are committed to helping me become the best version of myself that I can be. Those people invest their time, energy, and resources in me. They care deeply about seeing me succeed and make the best contribution I can to my family, my company, and the world. I trust these people implicitly and believe they have my best interest at heart. Theirs is the stuff solid relationships are made of. Because of the value they bring to my life, I find myself inspired to be that same kind of person for others.&nbsp;<br> <br> In <em>The Leadership Challenge</em>, Jim and Barry share some research which says “developing others has been shown to be the competency most frequently found among those at the top of their field.” Wow. Let that sink in a minute.Truly successful leaders (and human beings) are those who focus on developing others—not just themselves. This is powerful. But, if we are honest with ourselves, it brings up the tension that exists within us as part of our human nature: “But what if the people we develop get ahead of us and become more successful than we are?”&nbsp;<br> <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Nat'l%20Assn%20of%20Indian%20Nurses.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px; float: left; margin-top: 7px; margin-right: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px;">This very issue came up recently at a Leadership Challenge<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;Workshop I facilitated for the National Association of Indian Nurses of America. We were going through participants’ Leadership Practices Inventory<sup>®</sup> reports and focusing on leadership behavior #29: “Ensures that people grow in their jobs by learning new skills and developing themselves.” Members of the group were sharing how culturally, in India, employees don’t typically invest in others because jobs are scarce and it’s an extremely competitive landscape. People are more likely to hold their knowledge and expertise close to the chest in an effort to preserve their own status and positions.<br> <br> Although the context may be a little different in the U.S., I think we sometimes share that same internal struggle. We want to see other people succeed, but there’s that nagging fear that someone may become more successful than us if we’re too generous in sharing our time, knowledge, and expertise. This type of thinking is rooted in a scarcity mindset—that there’s not enough to go around—so we are tempted to hold back what we can truly offer others in an effort to protect ourselves. &nbsp;<br> <br> People who are committed to cultivating solid, trust-based relationships with those they lead must simply set that fear aside and live out of the belief that there is a direct connection between our contribution to other people’s success and our own. We must have a vision for our own ceilings to become the floors that the people we are developing will someday stand on. Relationships flourish when people sense that we are authentically investing in them— not to get something from them but simply to see them reach their highest potential. &nbsp;<br> <br> This type of leadership is sorely missing in today’s culture. Leaders who fully embrace this as part of their leadership philosophy automatically stand out from everyone else because it is such a rarity. People flock to leaders who genuinely care about and are truly committed to seeing others become all they can be, even if it means those people someday surpass them in some way. A true leader will see that as a job well done, not as a threat or disappointment. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> What could our work environments look like if we committed to creating open, generous relationships where a focus on developing others becomes our hallmark? Spend some time today thinking about who you can invest in and develop—someone out there needs what you have to offer in order to reach their full potential!&nbsp;<br> <br> Amy Savage is co-founder and managing partner of Fine Points, a Leadership Challenge® Global Training Partner that is committed to helping others increase their influence by changing their leadership behavior.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <strong>Q:</strong> I’ve recently noticed a change in the way The Leadership Challenge<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;and the LPI<sup>®</sup>:&nbsp;Leadership Practices Inventory<sup>®</sup> are described. &nbsp;They used to be referred to as “research-based,” but now it’s “evidence-based.” &nbsp;What do these terms actually mean? What’s the difference?&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>A:</strong> Perhaps the simplest way to make the distinction between these two terms is to say that evidence is what is discovered from doing research. In other words, we conduct research in order to discover evidence.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Evidence is the outcome; research is the process.<br> </strong><br> When we conduct research, we critically investigate or experiment with the aim of discovering new facts, revising existing theories, or making practical applications of new ideas. If we do the research in a way that meets acceptable standards we get valid and reliable (and we hope useful) information or evidence.&nbsp;<br> <br> Something that is research-based, then, has been developed through a process of investigation, inquiry or experimentation. Something that is evidence-based has valid and reliable information to support the claims that are made. That’s exactly what we’ve done in the 30-plus years of work investigating what leaders do when they are performing at their best. In that sense, <strong><em>The Leadership Challenge</em>&nbsp;and the <strong>LPI</strong>: Leadership Practices Inventory&nbsp;are both research-based <em>and</em> evidence-based.</strong><br> <br> The Leadership Challenge is the original research-based leadership development framework. When we began our initial investigation in the early 1980s, we wanted to know what leaders did when they were at their best. We created a research protocol that we called the Personal-Best Leadership Experience questionnaire. There were 38 open-ended questions. &nbsp;We collected more than 5,000 of these surveys and another 10,000 respondents completed a short form questionnaire. We also conducted in-depth, face-to-face and telephone interviews and those now number over 500. The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership<sup>®</sup> model emerged from our analysis of the actions people described in their personal-best stories.&nbsp;<br> <br> The items for the LPI were derived by recording specific one-sentence statements of behavior described in the Personal-Best Leadership Experiences. Statements were selected, modified, or discarded following lengthy discussions and iterative feedback sessions with respondents and subject matter experts, as well as through empirical analyses of the behavior-based statements. The result, after several iterations, was the 30-item LPI. And we continue to work to improve the validity and reliability of the instrument through ongoing research.<br> <br> Model creation and development of the LPI have been only part of our research. The other part continues to examine whether or not frequent use of The Five Practices makes a difference in the workplace and also the extent to which demographic characteristics explain the impact that leaders have. Two separate assessments are used to make these determinations. Our <em>Positive Workplace Attitudes</em> (PWA) survey measures what scholars and practitioners commonly refer to as “engagement” at work. A second set of questions that LPI respondents voluntarily complete are about nine demographic variables. These studies enable us to answer the “so what” question: Does it matter if leaders demonstrate The Five Practices more or less frequently? Does it really matter how leaders behave? This is the evidence-based part.<br> <br> The answer to the “so what” question is this: It makes a significant and meaningful difference how frequently leaders demonstrate The Five Practices. The more frequently leaders demonstrate the behaviors measured by the LPI the higher the workplace engagement. And, it doesn’t matter if the leaders or constituents are young or old, male or female, from one country or another, at senior levels or on the front line, or have any of the other demographic characteristics. They account for next to nothing in terms of engagement. What matters most is what leaders do.&nbsp;<br> <br> The <em>evidence</em> is clear: leadership makes a difference and exemplary leadership makes a positive difference.&nbsp;<br> <strong><br> Jim Kouzes</strong> is the Dean’s Executive Fellow of Leadership, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University. Cited by The Wall Street Journal as one of the twelve best executive educators in the U.S., he is also winner of the 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award by Trust Across America.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> This is the story of Luis Guerrero, a passionate believer in The Leadership Challenge®, whose journey began seven years ago in California’s Pajaro Valley when he was selected by his employer, an international agriculture company, to participate in a year-long leadership development program. Using the Leadership Practices Inventory® (LPI®) as a starting point, the cornerstone of the program was The Leadership Challenge with a two-day workshop facilitated by Certified Master Dan Schwab. Development plans and activities emphasized behavior change, and I worked with participants—including Luis—throughout the year as a coach.<br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>Taking the First Step into The Leadership Challenge</strong><br> <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Luis1.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 187px; float: left; margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">By any account (including his own), Luis was skeptical and reserved at first. But that all changed the day he got his LPI results which, for him, were a timely wake-up call.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The LPI indicated low frequency in Encourage the Heart behaviors, which came as no surprise to Luis. After all, he grew up in a home where “being tough” was highly prized and as the oldest of five boys did not often hear praise and recognition. What did surprise him was learning how important and essential these behaviors were for leaders. Discovering this gave Luis a whole new outlook, one that would ultimately change the way he interacted with others—as a manager, &nbsp;husband, and &nbsp;father. While coming too late to prevent a divorce, Luis’ new approach would later lead to reconciliation with his wife and a remarriage when she saw the dramatic behavior changes he had made. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> For Luis, his first introduction to The Leadership Challenge was nothing less than an opportunity to find himself, to see things from a different perspective. “It has become a way to stop and show others a different person.”<br> <br> <strong>Reaching into the community with The Student Leadership Challenge<br> </strong><br> Having experienced profound personal change through his own experience with The Leadership Challenge, Luis wished only that he’d been exposed to it earlier in life.&nbsp;<br> <br> He saw it this way: “Leadership could be defined for youth differently. But in reality, they can become leaders just by setting a good example for their friends and families. I think a good, effective leader is one who can move people. Being a good role model or someone people to want to be like … that’s being a leader. A leader is anyone who can have an impact on another person. And that could be a fifth grader.”<br> <br> To give others an opportunity to see themselves as leaders early on, and to help them understand what it means to be a leader, Luis founded a small, nonprofit entity with a two-fold purpose: award college scholarships to children of migrant farm workers and also teach them leadership skills. He recruited volunteers, raised funds, and inspired high school students to join his leadership club where they experienced The Student Leadership Challenge® Workshop, completed The Student Leadership Practices Inventory® (SLPI®), and learned about The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. They participated in coaching sessions and each had the opportunity to take on a variety of leadership roles in the community in order to put their new learning into practice.&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> The first group of eight students to participate in Luis’ leadership club recently graduated from college. And he believes that introducing them early to The Leadership Challenge and the essential Practices needed to become an effective leader was extremely helpful in guiding them in that direction. “At the beginning, when we told them that participating in the leadership program was required to qualify for the scholarships, they didn’t really know what that meant…“What was leadership?”, and “Could I really become a leader?” In the end, the entire experience was an eye opener for a lot of students as they realized they could choose the behaviors that would impact their future. For me, too, this realization was profound. I’ve learned more from them than the other way around.”&nbsp;<br> <strong><br> Taking the Youth Leadership Challenge to Middle School soccer clubs<br> </strong><br> Inspired and energized by both his personal experience and his work with high school students, Luis didn’t stop there. He decided to extend leadership learning to the <a href="http://pvysc.net/">Pajaro Valley Youth Soccer Club</a> team he coaches. The girls on his team, now 13 years old, have been getting leadership lessons for three years and Luis has seen a real impact. &nbsp;“With each different phase in life emotions change and I’ve seen it as critical to work with them on building a core foundation of values and team building that will carry them through all those changes. As in most sports and work settings, the most important contributor to success is our ability to engage with other people. And developing the skills of leadership at a young age can really help strengthen the interaction among players and, as a result, deepen the respect they have for one another's strengths and areas of opportunities. In fact, in the last couple of months I’ve been working with the girls more on leadership than on the sport.” &nbsp;<br> <br> Routinely, the girls work on leadership skills through experiential activities (see samples <a href="http://studentleadershipchallenge.com/Resource/using-the-student-leadership-challenge-with-middle--and-high-schoolers.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>). They talk about winning—on and off the soccer field—how to treat each other in school, how to handle bullies and other teen challenges, and how to engage in The Five Practices in all aspects of their lives. Recently Luis also was instrumental in getting a grant for the soccer club to bring leadership development opportunities to more teams. Coaches are now being trained and a program has been developed to give all youth soccer players age 11-15 access to this learning.<br> <br> <strong>One man. One vision.&nbsp;<br> </strong><br> Through The Leadership Challenge, Luis found himself. He found his way back to his family. And he found his vision: to bring leadership awareness and opportunities to youth in his community. He feels strongly that learning about leadership at a young age can be life changing. And he’s making a difference, leading by example and enlisting others in his cause.&nbsp;<img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Luis2.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 151px; float: right; margin-top: 8px; margin-right: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><br> <br> Luis believes there are a lot of forces out there working to prevent our youth from becoming better leaders. “Kids are asked to do a lot, to make a lot of decisions, and sometimes they have to make difficult ones. So, for me, I think the greatest opportunity here is to expose them to a different way of thinking, allowing them to become more open, to mature, and to make better decisions.”&nbsp;<br> <br> “In the end, I want to know, when I’m not around, that my kids are doing right, they’re doing good, that they have enough tools to be successful in life. And leadership is one of those essential tools. It’s so important in middle school and high school to have self-esteem, to have enough confidence to stand up when things are not going right and to appreciate when they are. Leadership training gives these young kids that confidence because they come to realize that it’s all about believing in yourself.” &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Deb Calvert</strong>, a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge®, is president of People First Productivity Solutions with expertise in constructing leadership development programs, conducting team effectiveness workshops, and boosting organizational performance through executive coaching, She can be reached at <a href="mailto:deb.calvert@peoplefirstps.com">deb.calvert@peoplefirstps.com</a> or follow her on <a href="http://https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ADEAAABukKkBn5hYbdX1cneNliN3hX0l71xIJqU&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=Ncte&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=103006461442947932400&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=62&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A103006461442947932400%2CVSRPtargetId%3A7245993%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;<br>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Leaders find the common thread that weaves the fabric of human needs into a colorful tapestry. They connect others to what is most meaningful in a shared vision. They lift people to higher levels of motivation and morality, and continuously reinforce that they can make a difference in the world.&nbsp;<br> <br> Take one day this week to focus on the Practice of Inspiring a Shared Vision. Speak with at least one individual constituent or team member during the day about your own convictions—about the higher meaning and purpose of your work. Make notes about your conversation and consider how you might use what you learned to motivate others to a higher level of work. &nbsp;<br> <br> Adapted from <em>The Leadership Challenge Practice Book</em>, James M.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Become “the best-run government” in the nation, if not the world—a lofty challenge that King County Executive Dow Constantine laid out to all employees of King County, Washington State’s most populous county and home to a little over two million residents. As one of his strategic priorities, he also embedded in this ambitious goal the Lean concepts of visible leadership, respect for people, and support of continuous improvement. &nbsp;<br> <br> With the support and advocacy of Caroline Whalen, County Administrative Officer for the Department of Executive Services, the Records and Licensing Services (RALS) division was among the first to step up to accept the challenge of becoming a model organization for what it meant to be “best run”. And in 2012, Division Director Norm Alberg and Deputy Director Megan Pedersen gathered together other members of the leadership team to begin their quest to dramatically change how they went about providing for the needs of the residents of the region. &nbsp;<br> <br> While much of the fanfare around the initiatives in King County focused on Lean tools, Norm and Megan observed that after many discrete Kaizen events in RALS in 2010-2011, a continuous improvement mindset and orientation was still lacking in the division. Acknowledging that something else needed to be done, they sought the expertise of Integris Performance Advisors to build a broader, more holistic view of continuous improvement—a systemic approach that would help the division evolve from simply doing large-scale value stream mapping events to rooting every aspect of their operation in continuous improvement methodology. They began by organizing the principles and concepts of Lean around four key dimensions that would be their focus: culture, continuous improvement, enterprise alignment, and results.&nbsp;<br> <br> To begin their transformation, the group zeroed in on culture and enabling behaviors and values. &nbsp;By being intentional about creating a culture built on respect and employee engagement, they consciously embraced the need to change how they led and managed others. &nbsp;Their goal was to enable the people in the organization to do their best more often. To accomplish their goal, they knew they needed to start with their leaders. And for that, they turned to The Leadership Challenge and the evidence-based research of the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® that served as a framework for creating new expectations for how leaders in the organization should behave. &nbsp;<br> <br> Beginning with the Leadership Practices Inventory® 360 (LPI® 360), the entire senior management team then experienced two full days of The Leadership Challenge® Workshop. They shared specific goals and timelines with each other to ensure peer-to-peer accountability and fully committed to take action on what they had learned.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Tying The Leadership Challenge to RALS’ Mission, Vision and Values</strong><br> After workshop participants considered best practices and committed to action plans for themselves as leaders, RALS senior management used the experience as a springboard to work on strategic alignment for the division. &nbsp;They met for several days to develop clarity around the Mission, Vision, Values, Key Objectives and Metrics across each section of RALS in order to provide a road map for organizational success over the next 24 months. &nbsp;<br> <br> According to Norm Alberg, “One of the key initiatives from the Mission-Vision-Values work was to recreate the role of the supervisor who, as part of the group’s Clarity Map, was identified as &nbsp;“competent, confident and compassionate leaders who guide their team members in achieving measurable results with advocacy and accountability.” This shows the aspirational aspect of the work that we hoped to do—coupling Lean Thinking with The Leadership Challenge,”&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Creating a Common Language of Leadership</strong><br> The next step in the RALS transformation to become a model “best-run” organization was to take the power of The Leadership Challenge beyond senior management to those in supervisory positions. &nbsp;Since The Five Practices represented a new way of operating for supervisors, Norm and Megan chose to start the process by engaging these emerging leaders with the LPI Self assessment rather than the LPI 360. &nbsp;Once RALS supervisors had the opportunity to begin putting their learning into action—approximately 12 months later—they were then asked to complete the LPI again, this time asking others to rate them on the 30 behaviors in the LPI 360.<br> <br>

               </blockquote><br> <strong>Helping Leaders Improve Using Individual Development Plans</strong><br> With a common language of leadership firmly established for leaders at all levels within the RALS division, Norm and Megan turned their attention to other components required to support the new leadership actions. &nbsp;With the help of Integris, they designed an Individual Development Plan (IDP) process that took into account “five buckets” of work that people in supervisory and managerial roles are responsible for: leadership, continuous improvement, communications, performance management, and operations. &nbsp;The IDPs tied together the specific business results each leader was responsible for and the leadership behaviors that would help the organization build the respectful culture for the future. &nbsp;From there they worked to build anticipation and excitement for how the new gift of feedback from the LPI could help people grow both as leaders and as developers of others. &nbsp;Supervisor-manager “Teaching Pods” prepared lessons to share with their colleagues on other tactical and important management skill areas, like handling conflict, customer service and meeting management, to support the specific business results of the units in becoming a “best run agency” within a “best run government.”<br> <br> Recently, the division’s leaders completed the LPI 360s, some for the first time and others as a repeat, followed by a half-day workshop during which they worked to refine their IDP’s. &nbsp;Leaders openly shared their LPI 360 insights and talked about how those lessons would be combined with other feedback from both the RALS Director’s Office and their colleagues to make their IDP as meaningful as possible. They also created a “SMART” (Specific, Measureable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound) goal in support of each of the 3-5 items laid out in their IDP. &nbsp;Specific action plans to develop and clarify each of those SMART goals brought clarity to the exercise. &nbsp;<br> <br> In addition to identifying opportunities for improvement in their IDPs, leaders were tasked with identifying a specific strength to build upon and share with others. Seeking to Encourage the Heart, Norm and Megan felt it was important for leaders’ individual development that they not only focus on improving weaknesses but also on leveraging and enhancing what they were already doing well. In this way, they have created the foundation for a learning environment tied to the tenets of both Lean/Continuous Improvement and The Leadership Challenge of embracing failures as learning opportunities and celebrating and recognizing successes. RALS leaders are also beginning to Model the Way for personal development for their staff.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Continuing On</strong><br> With approved IDPs now in place, the RALS Director’s Office is executing a plan to have quarterly “check in” sessions to see how leaders are progressing. &nbsp;A second round of Leadership Challenge workshops, with coaching and a team debrief, are on the schedule. &nbsp;And RALS continues to modify and learn as they Challenge the Process to embed The Five Practices into their culture of leadership.<br> <br> <strong>Megan Pedersen</strong> is Deputy Director of the King County Records and Licensing Services (RALS) Division where she leads by example and strives for operational excellence by engaging employees.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> As one of the largest children’s hospitals in the U.S.—ranked nationally in 10 pediatric specialties—Texas Children’s Hospital has become a leader in maternal child health. Every year our Pavilion for Women performs 7,000 deliveries, over 25,000 surgeries, and provides emergency care to more than 113,000 patients. &nbsp;And with over 9,000 employees and 3,000 affiliated providers, we are among an esteemed group of healthcare organizations awarded designated ANCC Magnet status—the most prestigious distinction a healthcare organization can receive from the American Nursing Association that recognizes nursing excellence and quality patient outcomes.<br> What we see today at Texas Children’s—exponential growth with a focus on achieving excellence—began more than 25 years ago with the arrival of Mark Wallace, our current CEO. Since 1989, he has made leadership and leadership development an everyday priority, building and sustaining a culture driven by <a href="http://infinitepassion.org/" target="_blank">leadership maxims</a> that are all fully consistent with The Leadership Challenge and that define the importance and contribution of leadership to achieving both personal and organizational outcomes. &nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Leadership applies to everyone, a winning attitude is key, and a strong work ethic is essential<br> </strong><br> Since 2013, Texas Children’s has been continuing the push to sustain a culture of leadership with one initiative in particular—a program focused on bringing nurse leaders closer to the care of patients and families and increasing the number of nurses at the bedside. And in a health system of over 2,500 Registered Nurses and over 200 Advance Practice Nurses, implementing the changes needed to accomplish these outcomes has been a team sport. From the start, our Director of Organizational Development, Jim Smalley, PhD, has worked in partnership with the hospital and nursing leadership team to create the structures and processes needed to select the right candidates for the frontline leadership positions and to prepare them for their transition into one of the most difficult manager roles in healthcare. I joined the team only recently, as we began rolling out the frontline leadership model across the system, and it was immediately apparent that The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® model had been integrated into a number of key components. Among the most notable have been the following: &nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>System-wide nursing summit and strategic planning sessions.</strong> Led by our Chief Nursing Officer (CNO), each of these sessions embodied the Practice of Inspiring a Shared Vision as leaders and staff from across the system came together to begin forging a vision and formulating plans of action with shared goals, key drivers, and interventions. Together they envisioned the future and set the stage for nursing leadership and clinical bedside nurses to strengthen the delivery of care to patients and their families. &nbsp;The CNO inspired the entire team to challenge current structures and processes to achieve system goals.<br> <br> <strong>Restructured frontline bedside management.</strong> Texas Children’s leadership development program had many facets but the primary goal was to restructure frontline bedside nursing management. &nbsp;The important role of the Patient Care Manager was created at the unit level and staff was restructured to include a mix of experienced clinicians and managers. &nbsp;A robust training and development program provided critical support for this group and was heavily influenced by the belief that all nurses are leaders and that developing leadership skills among clinicians as well as managers was key to our success. &nbsp;Leadership competencies, consistent with The Leadership Challenge, were subsequently hardwired into the performance evaluation structure to help ensure broad application of The Five Practices across the organization.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Bedside Fridays.</strong> Role modeled and initiated by all nurse leaders, Bedside Fridays grew from the second overall goal of &nbsp;our leadership development initiative: to increase the visibility of nurse leaders at all levels and increase the frequency of their interactions with direct patient care, and frontline staff and leaders. &nbsp;Off with business dress and on with scrubs and sneakers. &nbsp;Fridays are now reserved as rounding days, with regularly scheduled meetings only occurring on other days of the week. The presence of nurse leaders in the bedside patient care areas fosters collaboration by building trust between leaders and staff—exemplifying the Practices of Enabling Others to Act and Modeling the Way as they set the example by aligning actions with key values. &nbsp;More than making rounds, the presence of nurse leaders provides an opportunity for them to see first-hand &nbsp;nurses in their element and functioning as part of a team— living out the nursing process in action. &nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Interactive coaching sessions with frontline managers.</strong> During the initial launch phase of the program, frontline managers participated in Language of Leadership sessions, held over a four-week period as part of the preparation for our annual team member satisfaction and engagement survey. Held in roundtable fashion, 15-20 managers came together to practice formulating data-based descriptions of their unit’s accomplishments related to staffing, hiring, turnover, and unit-based outcomes.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Three thank yous. </strong>&nbsp;We also introduced the concept of three thank yous, which embodied the Practice of Encourage the Heart. Because genuine appreciation and personal recognition are critical to leadership success, managers continue to be encouraged to thank a nursing team member at least three times when delegating a specific task or function: when they accept the task, when they're doing the task, and after the task is completed. For example, when census peaks and patient care demand exceeds the number of nurses scheduled, asking staff to work overtime or asking part-time staff to pick up extra shifts is a customary strategy. &nbsp;Patient care managers are encouraged to thank the nurse when they accept the extra shift assignment, thank them again during the actual shift, and sometime later, usually the next time the nurse is on shift, the manager is encouraged to thank them again. &nbsp;This third thank you may come at a time when the extra shift is “ancient history” to the manager and there may have been numerous other staffing issues raised and solved in the meanwhile. &nbsp;But to the individual returning to work, it’s likely a fresh memory. &nbsp;Sincere appreciation not only acknowledges team member contributions, it Models the Way for team members to Encourage the Heart of everyone they come in contact with and delegate to in the course of their patient care shifts. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> We are continuing to look for ways to more fully integrate The Five Practices and the Leadership Practices Inventory® as we move forward in expanding our frontline nursing leadership programs. With the full support and dedication of our entire leadership team, we are committed to working together to enable everyone on the staff of Texas Children’s to continue the extraordinary work of caring for children and their families.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Richard A.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> “<em>The class was filled with laughter, learning, and people making connections. It was amazing.</em>” &nbsp;<br> —attendee Darcy Richardson, health educator<br> <br> <br> We in The Leadership Challenge Community know that being successful as a leader—in fact, in just about anything in life—requires collaboration. We don’t do it alone. And that was certainly the case with the Masters Give Back program recently offered just prior to this year’s The Leadership Challenge Forum in San Francisco.&nbsp;<br> <br> With Certified Masters Dan Schwab and Tom Pearce taking the lead, authors Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner, along with Wiley staff members, worked together to reach out to their various contacts in the Bay Area’s nonprofit community to fill this year’s class to capacity. And on June 16 and 17 at the Hotel Nikko in the heart of the city 20 nonprofit leaders from a diverse range of Bay Area groups came together to create a stimulating dynamic for the program. Participants included leaders from organizations such as Youth Radio, the US Army, Camp Fire, Boys and Girls Club, Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, Breathe California, and Larkin Street Youth Services.<br> <br> As in years past, this Masters Give Back program was provided at no cost to participants in an effort to provide the advantage of The Leadership Challenge to aspiring community leaders who might otherwise not have access to the curriculum. Each participant completed the Leadership Practices Inventory® (LPI®) assessment prior to the first day’s session and over the course of the next one and-a-half days, everyone received coaching on their LPI report as well as a full set of workshop materials. &nbsp;<br> <br> This year’s participants were treated to a special session with Jim and Barry who joined in for a discussion about goals and challenges leaders in the nonprofit sector face. While Dan and Tom provided most of the program facilitation, which included experiential activities and lots of discussion time, Certified Master-in-Training KJ Jenison played a critical role in the program’s success keeping track of applications, tracking LPI data, and matching up the many Certified Masters and Certified Masters-in-Training who volunteered to provide one-to-one coaching with participants.&nbsp;<br> <br> Certified Masters-in-Training Terence Yeung and Amy Dunn also played important roles during this program. &nbsp;Amy facilitated group activities. Terence presented the LPI to the group and walked people through their results. In addition, Brett Cooper, co-founder of Integris Performance Advisors, served as the program’s closing speaker and shared with participants his own nonprofit leadership experience working with the East Bay Stand Down, a program that supports veterans of all ages with medical, dental, spiritual, and emotional needs through a weekend rally. &nbsp;<br> <br> Following the onsite program, phone coaching was offered to any participant who was not able to stay for the one-on-one discussions directly following the workshop. Participants were also able to re-open their LPI assessments immediately following the workshop in an effort to gain additional feedback that could prove valuable to their leadership journey.&nbsp;<br> <br> We feel privileged to have had the opportunity to be a part of the program this year and to develop such a rich experience for these aspiring leaders. But we didn’t do it alone. So many people helped make this year’s Masters Give Back Program a success. In fact, with many hands, the load was light. And that’s why special thanks need to go out to everyone else who played a role, including: Ciaran Coleman, Brett Cooper, Amy Dunn, Dick Heller, Beth High, Evans Kerrigan, Bill Mugavin, Amy Savage, Terence Yeung, the amazing Wiley team and, of course, Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner and all of the incredible participants who took the time and made the commitment to learn to be the best leaders they can be. &nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>KJ Jenison</strong>, Director of Client Experience for Integris Performance Advisors &amp; BestBehaviors.com, believes in collaborative endeavors that empower others to grow both personally and professionally.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Showing you care about your teammates, colleagues, direct reports, and others you regularly interact with is always important. But during times of stress and adversity, this takes on special significance. Everyone needs encouragement and, as leaders, one of the most important responsibilities we have is to keep hope alive by making sure that others know they are valued and appreciated, that they have internalized a winning mentality. The following is the sixth and final actionable strategy adapted from <em><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118911296.html" target="_blank">Turning Adversity into Opportunity</a></em>&nbsp;that can help you do that—to help ensure that those around you can see positive images of the future. &nbsp;<br> <br> Strategy #6: Show You Care. Positive emotions fuel optimism and hope. That's why telling positive stories contributes to people feeling more capable during times of difficulty.&nbsp;<br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>How can I make sure that people on my team know that I care about them?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>What can I do to maintain face-to-face interactions and conversations with people?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>How do I communicate my belief that the people I am working with are winners?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>How can I share the sacrifices that people may be, or are being, called on to make?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>What positive steps have already been taken and how can I communicate those to others?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>What can I do daily to demonstrate a positive and hopeful outlook? &nbsp;</li> 
                <li>Who has done something that has made a positive difference, and how can I tell their story to others? &nbsp;</li> 
                <li>What can I do to recognize the positive contributions that are being made?</li>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Feedback from others is one of the best learning tools there is. When colleagues engage in the 360-feedfback process and complete the LPI®: Leadership Practices Inventory®, they often want to know that you intend to do something with it. So when you are ready to plan for that crucial conversation (or series of conversations), here are some tips on how you can get the most learning out of the LPI process. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Accept the feedback as a gift. Feedback may not come wrapped in a package with a bow, but it’s still one of the most valuable gifts you’ll ever receive. Why? Because we know from our research that leaders who are the most open to feedback are far more effective than leaders who resist hearing other people’s perspectives on their behaviors.<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>Take the feedback seriously. You might wonder, “Will it really make a difference if I increase the frequency of the behaviors measured by the LPI?” It will. Research consistently shows the same results: the more frequently you demonstrate the behaviors included in the LPI, the more likely you will be seen as an effective leader.</li> 
               </ul> Excerpted from the <em>Leadership Practices Inventory® Workbook, 4th edition</em>, James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner, © 2013, published by Pfeiffer/An imprint of Wiley. All rights reserved. &nbsp;<br>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Imagine taking a dingy-looking goldfish out of a bowl of dirty water. You scrub it down and shine it up. In short order, you practically have a brand new goldfish. Then, you put it back in the same nasty water and wonder why it’s back to its old grimy self in two or three days.&nbsp;<br> <br> Unfortunately, our poor goldfish’s dilemma also plays out in the world of leadership development. People go to an outstanding workshop or conference where they become re-inspired, learn new and usable skills, and leave resoundingly committed to becoming more effective in their work. In other words, like the goldfish they get scrubbed and cleaned. Within a couple of weeks, however, they are often right back to the same behaviors and attitudes as before. &nbsp;Why? The systems and environment they go back into (the dirty water) have not changed and, in fact, are seductively working to ensure the new behaviors never get a chance to take root and blossom. With little or no support, encouragement, coaching or incentive to continue to practice new skills and experiment with different behaviors, people naturally drift back to the way they were.&nbsp;<br> <br> For organizations to grow leaders capable of running successful businesses today, and moving them forward tomorrow, there must be a culture supporting leadership development. It is impossible for anything to grow—plants in a garden or leadership in an organization—if there is not an environment that fosters and produces growth.&nbsp;<br> <br> Which brings me to The Leadership Challenge Forum, an annual event designed to promote the growth and development of leaders in all aspects of life. &nbsp;It’s a remarkable continuing education experience for users and practitioners of The Leadership Challenge methodology and, for that matter, anyone interested in developing leaders. And this year’s conference, developed around the theme of Cultivating a Culture of Leadership, was especially relevant. Through case study and breakout sessions, and terrific keynote presentations, it focused on helping all of us better understand how important culture is for sustainable leadership growth, and what it takes to create that kind of positive culture. Perhaps more than any other Forum event I’ve attended (and there have been many!), this one truly made me realize the role we can play in helping the goldfish in our care—our clients, friends and family, members of our community—thrive and prosper, and why this topic of cultivating culture may be at the core of effective, ongoing development efforts of any kind.<br> <br> From the first morning when authors Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner took the stage to welcome us, they set the tone for the next two days, reinforcing how the best leaders continue to be lifelong learners and that a culture of leadership has, at its core, a value of learning. &nbsp;As usual, they modeled that message. In fact, the entire Forum was structured to create a massive learning environment, with people from around the world sharing lessons learned and offering proven practices and novel ideas with total unselfishness. New technology was deployed in the general sessions to facilitate large scale idea exchange. And if you looked closely enough, you would have even seen the authors taking notes during some of the sessions. Learning at the Forum was not just a noble-sounding aspiration, it was happening naturally—and intentionally. &nbsp;How much better all organizations would be if they would actively embrace this kind of insatiable appetite for learning, and then create the environments to ensure it occurs.<br> <br> As in years past, Jim and Barry again were generous in sharing the stage with others. During Day One’s general sessions we heard from two leaders who are already cultivating cultures of leadership in the non-profit sector and in business: <a href="http://www.leadershipchallengeforum.com/UserFiles/2015%20Forum-%20Carmody%20and%20Devanesan2.pdf" target="_blank">Ruha Devansesan and Cora Carmody</a>.And the following day we had the privilege to hear from one of the foremost authorities on organizational culture: &nbsp;author and corporate culture guru Ed Schein. In a down-home style conversation with Jim and Barry—and with all attendees in the room thanks to the interactive technology provided by Covision—Ed shared some truly thought-provoking insights about the topic. With a master’s degree from Stanford, a Harvard Ph.D., and as a former MIT Sloan Fellow professor, his academic credentials are impeccable and yet his message was real world, relevant, and practical. There was an enormous amount of buzz about the value of Ed’s remarks. &nbsp;And personally, while I always appreciate the chance to hear informative and wise perspectives from guests at the Forum, Ed’s participation this year was truly a special gift.<br> <br> Also special this year was seeing the fast growing investment others are making to develop the next generation of leaders. There were groups from school systems in Texas and Arkansas in attendance, along with a number of other participants working with students and faculties at various levels within the educational system. They were all seeking new ideas, tools, and techniques for creating cultures that invite and encourage students to begin the process of leadership development while still in school. &nbsp;In addition, there were several breakout sessions focused on how The Student Leadership Challenge is being used around the world to help develop the leaders of tomorrow. &nbsp;It is exciting to see the increasing array of outstanding student-focused resources dedicated to this effort. And, from what I see, the world needs more and more younger people willing and equipped to step up to address the tough challenges confronting not only them but the rest of us, too.<br> <br> All that, in matter of two short days, is what brings to my last observation about the experience of The Leadership Challenge Forum….and goldfish. Most of us who have devoted our lives to leadership development find great joy in experiencing, first-hand, the growth of people. And this really stuck out for me this year in a number of ways. &nbsp;<br> <br> First, the staff of our gracious host, Wiley…For years they have taken care of zillions of really important details to ensure the success of these events, nearly always operating behind the scenes. Today, they are responsible for much bigger and more important outcomes—both at the Forum and on a day-to-day basis—and they have clearly stepped up to the challenge. &nbsp;How exciting and rewarding to see their growth, and to directly benefit from it.<br> <br> Then there is the continuous pipeline of colleagues engaged in the process of developing the knowledge and expertise to achieve the level of Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge. &nbsp;Although I see most of them only once a year (at the Forum), I’ve known many of them since they first connected with the community. Today, those who have accomplished their goal are confident, polished, capable, and contributing leaders who are giving back. Their growth is striking.<br> <br> The progress and development of these friends and colleagues may be the greatest evidence of all about the power of an effective culture. The aspiring Certified Masters are part of a system that challenges and supports them. They are given real opportunities to step up, and they hold themselves accountable—to themselves and to their fellow community members. &nbsp;They have formal mentors and, at the same time, they have dozens of others who are freely offering advice, hands-on help, and lots of encouragement. Everyone wants everyone else to be the best version of themselves they can be, and to succeed in all aspects of their lives. And in that vein, it was especially rewarding to see my fellow colleague and Certified Master Tom Pearce honored by the Wiley Leadership Challenge team with the Star Award—well-deserved recognition for the way he Models the Way with his willingness to be of service to others.&nbsp;<br> <br> Perhaps our individual and collective successes will ultimately be measured by the number of organizations we can touch, and help build the kinds of leadership cultures they need to help their own people develop and excel in similar ways. &nbsp;What a great job it is to help organizations make this happen.<br> <br> <strong>Steve Coats</strong>, Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge, is managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a leadership development education and consulting firm.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> As many leaders who have been asked to share their personal best stories have reminded us, no leader ever gets anything extraordinary done single-handedly. &nbsp;Especially in the new normal world of rapid change and disruptive innovation, people have to become more involved with one another—not less. &nbsp;It is through social connection and social intimacy that we are motivated to strengthen our relationships, resolving interpersonal conflicts by finding win-win solutions and doing favors for one another with the clear expectation that these will be reciprocated. &nbsp;<br> <br> <br> And we, as leaders, have a responsibility, to help create the conditions necessary for people to build meaning into their lives at work, at home, and in the community. The following is the fifth of six actionable strategies adapted from <em><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118911296.html" target="_blank">Turning Adversity into Opportunity</a></em> that can help you do that—to navigate through the challenge and adversity of our times. &nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Strategy #5: &nbsp;Engage Others.</strong> &nbsp;There are others who are being affected by this transition. Collaboration and trust is essential to get through change and adversity. &nbsp;And, we feel a lot healthier in trying times when we get support from others.<br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Who else is being impacted?&nbsp;<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>How can we engage with them?&nbsp;<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>How can we use this opportunity to fortify our relationships with others and build partnerships?&nbsp;<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>How can I connect people with one another on the project?&nbsp;<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>How can I let others make choices?&nbsp;<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>Whom can we turn to for caring support and wise counsel?&nbsp;<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>How can we strengthen the sense that we are in this together? &nbsp;<br> <br> </li> 
                <li>Who has done something that has helped to make a difference, and how can we tell their story?</li>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <strong>Q:</strong> &nbsp;If experimenting is so essential to leadership, how can I create an atmosphere where experimenting and learning really flourishes?<br> <br> <strong>A:</strong> &nbsp;Thomas Edison said, “I failed my way to success.” It took over five thousand experiments to develop the filament for the electric bulb. “Every one of these experiments taught me something,” explained Edison, and that’s precisely the mantra of leaders. Leaders don’t see failures and mistakes as the end of the world, but simply another opportunity to learn and know something that they didn’t know before, and, often, had no way of knowing in advance. The point is that so many of us have gotten the message that “failure is not an option” or we need to “get it right the first time”. But experience shows us that things actually don’t happen that way. It’s the leader’s job to counteract that negative, counterproductive message.<br> <br> That said, the key to creating an environment where risk taking and experimenting can truly happen is somewhat paradoxical. We contend that risk taking is directly related to the extent to which people feel safe. If you want to help people extend themselves beyond their comfort zones and “the way we’ve always done it around here,” you’ve got to do things that make them feel safe, for example, reducing the cost of failure, expanding the benefits of trying, taking one step at a time, going first yourself (so that if anyone is to look foolish, it will be you), providing practice opportunities, establishing pilot and demonstration projects, and so on.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Barry Posner</strong> is the Accolti Endowed Professor of Leadership at the Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University, where he served as Dean of the school for 12 years. Together with Jim Kouzes, he is author of The Leadership Challenge—now in its fifth edition—and over a thirty other books and workbooks on leadership and leadership development.<br>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> As one of the world’s leading consumer goods companies, Unilever employs more than 172,000 people globally and sells its products in over 190 countries. Emerging markets, such as my country of Nigeria, currently account for 57% of its global business. Therefore, it has been a privilege to be chosen to work with a selection of the company’s emerging leaders, all of whom are Nigerians.&nbsp;<br> <br> We had previous opportunities to work with Unilever in 2012 and 2013, having facilitated a half-day team building session for the Executive Leadership Team and an Away Day retreat for the HR Team. Participating in both events was the company’s HR Director, Tolu Agiri, who was pleased with the facilitation results we obtained. When it was time to undertake a new approach to developing the company’s young leaders, Tolu turned to us again in mid-2013. Specifically, she invited us to discuss how we could build the leadership capacity of young trainees in transition to manager roles. These new managers had successfully completed an initial three-year training program, and Unilever wanted to prepare them for greater responsibilities with an additional &nbsp;program it called Transition Route Into Management (TRIM).<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRIM Programme for Management Trainees (TRIM 1)</span></strong><br> With coordinating support from the Leadership Development Manager at Unilever, we created an innovative six-month programme that combined group and individual sessions, action planning, and leadership practice. This programme was designed to give young leaders the best of the two worlds of coaching and training, and prime them for long-term roles in leadership.&nbsp;<br> <br> With just one exception, the initial group of 12 management trainees were all young—30 years and under—who had joined Unilever immediately after graduating from university. Because they lacked experience with other leadership models (and not having developed &nbsp;productive leadership behaviours), our focus for this group was to provide a proven leadership model—The Five Behaviours of Exemplary Leadership® by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner—that would enable them to develop their leadership capacity in their new roles.<br> <br> The Leadership Practices Inventory®360 (LPI360®) online assessment—completed as pre-work—was the first step of engagement for participants. A one-day Leadership Challenge Workshop came next, during which we incorporated activities provided in their copies of <em><a href="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/ProductDetail/9780470591987.aspx" target="_blank">An Introduction to The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® Participant Workbook</a></em>.<br> We then followed up the workshop with a variety of sessions and activities, including:<br> <br> Monthly activity-based workshops were a key component of our follow-up work with these management trainees. With their limited experience in corporate settings, we felt these young, emerging leaders would be more receptive to new ideas and wanted to give them a framework for exercising leadership early in their careers. Consequently, we gradually but intensely immersed them in The Five Practices with six monthly activity-based workshops. Using <em><a href="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/ProductDetail/9780470477137.aspx" target="_blank">The Leadership Challenge: Activities Book</a></em> as our primary resource, the first five workshops focused on each of The Five Practices while the sixth was a review and action planning session.&nbsp;<br> <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Unilever%20TRIM%20March%202014%20_cropped.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 181px; float: left; margin: 2px;">Participants responded to this learning with enthusiasm and commitment. As Bukola Olaiya observed at the end of the workshops, “It’s been a great six months of learning and putting to work what I’ve learnt. I have a better perspective on leadership. There are some pitfalls I will avoid having acquired new knowledge.”<br> <br> Individual coaching sessions also were important to the overall success of our work with the group. Spread over six months in hourly sessions, we coached participants on specific leadership behaviours based on their LPI 360 reports. For these coaching sessions, we found two tools especially valuable: <em><a href="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/ProductDetail/9780470377116.aspx" target="_blank">A Coach's Guide to Developing Exemplary Leaders</a></em> and <a href="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/ProductDetail/9781118182734.aspx" target="_blank">The Leadership Practices Inventory Workbook</a>.&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span><br> <br> LPI 360 retakes were completed in the final month of the coaching interactions. After working for nearly six months to enhance their leadership behaviours, the timing of the LPI 360 retakes gave these emerging leaders an opportunity to receive important Observer feedback and coaching sessions provided additional insights.&nbsp;<br> <br> It was with this group we first discovered practical validation of the research which indicates that leaders get better business results when they increase the frequency of The Five Practices. For example, Dapo Apolola, a regional sales manager, reported that by using all of The Five Practices his actions “delivered a result of 1% growth in 2 months to reverse a three-year decline…and in the second year, sales increased by more than 10%.”<br> <br> One year after the LPI retakes, a review and feedback session brought the participants together to share stories about how they had continued to find new and creative ways to apply The Five Practices and improve their effectiveness as leaders. As coaches and facilitators, we also listened to first-hand accounts of how these young leaders were applying the Five Practices. For instance, Category Manager Adedoyin Abanishe reflected, "As an individual contributor having to combine so many things and relate with several people across levels and functions, I've learnt that Encourage the Heart really works in getting other people on board.”<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRIM 2 for Experienced Managers</span></strong><br> Based on the positive feedback Unilever’s senior leaders received from participants in the TRIM 1 programme, we were commissioned to work with another group. This time the group consisted of 12 experienced managers, most of whom had acquired organisational experience before joining Unilever. This group, simply labelled TRIM 2, included sales managers, brand managers, and individual contributors across various functions. Being more experienced and primed in particular ways, they needed to positively enhance their behaviours.<br> <br> As with the TRIM 1 participants, The Leadership Practices Inventory®360 (LPI360®) online assessment—completed as pre-work—was the first step of engagement for our group of experienced managers. This was followed by a two-day Leadership Challenge Workshop which expanded our ability to engage these managers in more activities than the young trainees had time for during their one-day session. We were also able to use a wider range of resources, including <em><a href="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/ProductDetail/9781118552827.aspx" target="_blank">The Leadership Challenge Participant Workbook</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/ProductDetail/9780470592038.aspx" target="_blank">The Vision Book</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/ProductDetail/9780470591970.aspx" target="_blank">The Practice Book</a></em>, <a href="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/ProductDetail/9780470559703.aspx" target="_blank">Values Cards</a>, &nbsp;and <em><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470651725,descCd-buy.html" target="_blank">The Leadership Challenge, 5th edition</a></em>. &nbsp;<br> <br> Subsequent activities then focused on coaching and additional feedback:<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monthly Individual Coaching Sessions</span></strong><br> Based on participants’ individual LPI 360 reports, we coached the experienced managers on their leadership behaviours. Similar to the TRIM 1 group, one-hour coaching sessions were spread over a six-month period using a variety of valuable tools, including <em><a href="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/ProductDetail/9780470377116.aspx" target="_blank">A Coach's Guide to Developing Exemplary Leaders</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/ProductDetail/9781118182734.aspx" target="_blank">The Leadership Practices Inventory Workbook</a></em>, &nbsp;and <em><a href="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/ProductDetail/9780470591970.aspx" target="_blank">The Leadership Challenge Practice Book</a></em>.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LPI 360 Retakes</span></strong><br> In the final month of the coaching period, participants completed the LPI 360 assessments again. Much of the Observer feedback indicated positive changes in the behaviour of these experienced managers, which was confirmed in the feedback we received during the coaching sessions.<br> <br> A review and feedback session is planned for 2016. As we did for TRIM 1, the group will reconvene to share stories about how they have applied The Five Practices to enhance their leadership behaviours and results.&nbsp;<br> <br> Ahead of the review session, we already have received powerful feedback—both direct and indirect (from Observers)—that suggests truly profound changes have occurred, including &nbsp;improved communication, enhanced relationships, deeper employee commitment, and better bottom line results.&nbsp;<br> <br> In addition to the significant changes we see occurring at Unilever Nigeria, there are several important lessons we at Weyinmi Jemide LLP take away from this experience. On a personal level, it has been especially fulfilling to practically validate Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner’s research on The Five Practices and the LPI behaviours—indeed, leaders who exercise the LPI behaviours <em>do</em> achieve better business results! Through coaching, we also obtained proof of what works, which has enabled us to offer guarantees to other clients about the outcomes of The Leadership Challenge. We also found that the leadership narratives we heard from all the participants lend credence to LPI research about fostering loyalty and commitment, and reducing absenteeism. Finally, our experience with these leaders at Unilever Nigeria has reframed our approach to delivering The Leadership Challenge. We realise that we can provide enhanced value to clients with the productive combination of training and coaching—a combined strength of services that we will continue to promote to other clients and recommend to fellow professionals.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Weyinmi Jemide</strong> is Chief Client Officer of Weyinmi Jemide LLP based in Lagos, Nigeria.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Great leaders continually set goals and seek feedback. And the Leadership Practices Inventory® (LPI®) gives you a snapshot in time. It is a beginning point from which to move forward. To heighten your focus and practice with great purpose, decide now that you will retake the instrument within a specific period of time— we recommend between six and nine months—to see how you are doing and identify new priorities for your practice.&nbsp;<br> <br> Consistency in behavior is important to your credibility. It lets others know that they can count on you to be consistent in your actions so they know what to expect from you.<br> In the ideal scenario, your Self ratings would be very consistent with your Observer ratings. But in the real world, scores are not always consistent.<br> <br> There are a number of valid explanations for inconsistency in your feedback. For instance, some people know you better, people in various roles (or varying functions) have differing expectations of you, and you may behave differently with some people than with others. What’s important is to understand why people rate you differently than you rate yourself and think about the extent to which you need to be consistent.<br> <br> Excerpted from the <em>Leadership Practices Inventory Planner, 4th edition</em>, James M.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Challenge comes in various forms—a reluctant team, an over-controlling boss, an industry shift, or the introduction of a new technology. Whether large or small, however, leaders are the ones who take charge. We have a responsibility to develop in ourselves—and to help those around us develop—what psychologists call “psychological hardiness”, and to create conditions that encourage everyone to seize the initiative in tumultuous times. &nbsp;The following is the fourth of six actionable strategies adapted from <em><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118911296.html" target="_blank">Turning Adversity into Opportunity</a></em> that can help you do that.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Strategy #4: Take Charge of Change&nbsp;</strong><br> People who are proactive are healthier and more successful. In times of challenge and adversity leaders must make something happen. You may not control all of what is happening in the broader environment, but you are still in charge of your own life. Consider the following and make time to discuss these questions with your constituents:<br> &nbsp;<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>What decisions and actions do you control? &nbsp;<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>How can we positively influence the outcome?&nbsp;<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>What actions can you take to create forward momentum?&nbsp;<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>What little things can you do to get moving in the right direction?&nbsp;<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>How can we transform this struggle into an engaging learning experience?&nbsp;<br> •<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>If we are going to fall, how can we fall forward and achieve a sense of progress?<br> Taking charge of change is how you invent your future rather than simply letting it happen to you.<br> <br> <br> Copyright © 2014.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <strong>Q: </strong>&nbsp;Of all of the behaviors associated with The Five Practices, is there one that really stands out as perhaps key to truly bringing out the best in others?&nbsp;<br> <strong><br> A:</strong> I know we're not supposed to play favorites, but I can't help it. &nbsp;Of the 30 items that make up &nbsp;the Leadership Practices Inventory® (LPI®), there is one specific to Encourage the Heart that I find particularly powerful. &nbsp;It’s statement #10 that asks Observers to indicate how frequently a leader "Makes it a point to let people know about his/her confidence in their abilities".&nbsp;<br> <br> Do you remember as a child trying a new sport or hobby for the first time? &nbsp;Many of us heard the words, “You can do it!” or “I believe in you!” in those scenarios. Unfortunately, I find that something happens as we get into adulthood and for some reason we stop expressing our belief in each other. &nbsp;Why is that? &nbsp;<br> <br> Just because we are adults doesn’t mean that we stop needing people to encourage us in our gifts and abilities. &nbsp;In fact, Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner write in The Leadership Challenge, “Ask people to describe the best leaders they’ve ever had, and they consistently talk about individuals who brought out the best in them. &nbsp;They say things like, ‘She believed in me more than I believed in myself’ or ‘He saw something in me even I didn’t see’. &nbsp;Exemplary leaders bring others to life, figuratively speaking. &nbsp;These leaders dramatically improve others’ performance because they care deeply for them and have an abiding faith in their capacities.”<br> <br> The research that my business partner at Fine Points Professionals and I have been doing on positivity confirms what Jim and Barry found. &nbsp;When we have asked, “What is the most encouraging thing anyone has ever said to you?” the top answer is “I believe in you”. And on a personal note, I can attest to the power of these words. I’ve recently had my job role expand to include new things I’ve never done before, and my team has given me specific encouragement about their belief in my ability to excel in these new endeavors. Because of their expressed confidence in me, I find I have a renewed sense of vigor and commitment to accomplish what is in front of me. &nbsp;Jim and Barry are right… good leaders <strong>do</strong> indeed bring others to life.&nbsp;<br> <br> This leadership behavior—letting constituents know that we believe in their abilities, that we expect the best—also has the power to transform a negative environment. &nbsp;During a recent coaching session, a VP of a large organization shared how she felt that everyone on her new team was critical of each other and that the atmosphere in her department was largely negative. We discussed how she had a unique opportunity to set the example by starting to implement behavior #10. &nbsp;In the midst of negativity, I encouraged her to see that when leaders are intentional in expressing confidence in each individual—nurturing and supporting the development of every team member’s potential—they can start to change the environment. &nbsp;Leaders that intentionally practice this behavior more frequently can help move people from feeling devalued to being believed in. &nbsp;Even if it’s just one positive voice in the midst of many negative ones, the voice of the one matters. &nbsp;It’s like someone lighting a match in a dark room—the spark illuminates the potential within that person and they see what can be.&nbsp;<br> <br> I encourage everyone to take time every week to meaningfully express your belief and confidence in your individual team members. &nbsp;Remember, simply knowing you believe in them is not the same as expressing that belief to them verbally. &nbsp;The more consistently you engage in behavior #10, the more you will see your team push forward to try new things.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> This probably doesn't come as any surprise to you, but there’s no such thing as instant leadership—or instant expertise of any kind. Those who are the very best at anything became that way because they had a strong desire to excel, a belief that new skills and abilities can be learned, and a willing devotion to deliberate practice and continuous learning.&nbsp;<br> <br> What truly differentiates the expert performers from the good performers is hours of practice. Deliberate practice. The best leaders work at becoming the best and it doesn’t happen over a weekend.&nbsp;<br> <br> Excerpted from the Leadership Practices Inventory® Workbook, 4th edition, James M.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> The Masters Give Back initiative began as a gift of The Leadership Challenge® and our friends at Wiley in 2013. Over the years, it has turned into a working vision of an ideal model of how non-profit agencies develop their leaders and discover ways to substantially enhance the services they provide to those in need in their community.&nbsp;<br> <br> For the third consecutive year, International Leadership Associates (ILA) has been privileged to experience for ourselves how this program has touched the Cincinnati non-profit community and how much leadership development continues to happen. As in the past, our residential The Gift of Leadership Program (this year held March 16–18) included a powerful outside learning component at Camp Joy. A longtime partner of ILA, Camp Joy once again provided the venue, along with great food, a magical fire pit, and some of the best outdoor challenge course activities in the business. Facilitating The Leadership Challenge ® Workshop for our group of 20 aspiring leaders from area nonprofits was a privilege. And this year we were fortunate to be joined by Brent Carter of Fifth Third Bank who is soon to become one of the newest Certified Masters to join The Leadership Challenge community.&nbsp;<br> <br> <img alt="" src="http://webany.net/Sites/wiley-tlc/UserFiles/progress%20on%20a%20vision%201.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 326px;"><br> Photo Caption: The Leadership Challenge® 2015 program welcomed 20 enthusiastic participants representing a number of human services organizations in the greater Cincinnati area. [Photo credit: Kevin Hackman, Camp Joy]<br> <br> <strong>Unique Strategy</strong><br> As part of our overall effort to support the development of non-profit leaders throughout the Cincinnati community, plans are already in place for a second Leadership Challenge program in the fall, offered by Certified Master Valarie Willis. In addition, Valarie and I have partnered with our area’s &nbsp;Leadership Council of Human Services Executives and a number of key local businesses to move the leadership development of our non-profit leaders far beyond the offering of a couple of programs.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Live%20to%20Lead%20graphic.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 96px; float: left; margin-top: 3px; margin-right: 4px; margin-bottom: 3px;">Together we have created a more comprehensive development approach called LIVE to LEAD (Leaders Inspiring Visionary Excellence). Key competencies for non-profit leaders —such as talent management and change leadership—have been identified. And an entire curriculum of programs, built upon the core principles and Practices of The Leadership Challenge, is now being offered in addition to supplementary courses that include Building Relationships, Strategic Planning and Agility, and Change Leadership.&nbsp;<br> <br> One of the unique aspects of LIVE to LEAD that is new this year is that the supplementary programs are

Fifth Third Bank has taken the lead,&nbsp;providing non-profit leaders the opportunity to take the very same top quality development opportunities that the organization provides to its own aspiring leaders.&nbsp;
                <br> 
                <br> The first cohort of 24 non-profit leaders began the LIVE to LEAD curriculum earlier this year, and the first three sessions have been received with great excitement and very positive feedback. &nbsp;Plans are already in place for enrolling future cohorts. We also have set our sights on enrolling additional companies who will follow Fifth Third Bank’s lead and open their education doors to the leaders from our area non-profits. In addition, we are in the process of inviting other companies to join The E.W. Scripps Company, which stepped up early on to provide ongoing funding of scholarships to enable more non-profit leaders to participate in this leadership development initiative.&nbsp;
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> The Gift of Leadership process, begun only three years ago, is providing a well-deserved boost to the leadership development efforts of the Greater Cincinnati area non-profits. There is a new energy throughout the nonprofit community, and we are seeing evidence of more frequent collaboration and sharing of best practices among the agencies. The bottom line is that our vision of creating an even more well-served Cincinnati community, through stronger well-led human service agencies, is continuing to make progress at a rapid pace.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Clarity about personal values has the most significant impact on employees’ feelings about their work and what they’re doing in the workplace. This is not to say that shared values don’t matter. Our research and that of others suggests that it does. What it does point out, however, is that people cannot fully commit unless whatever they are being asked to commit to fits with their own beliefs. &nbsp;<br> <br> <br> As leaders we have a responsibility to make sure we create a climate in which people can thrive when faced with change, adversity, challenge, and stress. And the following is the third of six actionable strategies adapted from <em><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118911296.html" target="_blank">Turning Adversity into Opportunity</a></em> that can help you do that—to navigate through challenging times to discover what truly matters.&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> <strong>Strategy #3: &nbsp;Fully Commit to What's Important&nbsp;</strong><br> Change demands our full attention, imagination, and effort. People need to know what's most meaningful and important. &nbsp;And research clearly suggests that there is a significant measurable impact on people’s performance when their personal values are clear. &nbsp;<br> <br> <br> To implement this strategy, identify a situation you and your constituents are currently facing. Pause and reflect on the following questions and engage others you are working with in exploring how to broaden its application to address your collective challenge.&nbsp;<br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Why are we doing what we’re doing?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>What’s the larger purpose?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>Why does what we’re doing matter?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>What are we really passionate about?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>What important shared values and beliefs can we emphasize to keep people engaged?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>What are some exciting possibilities for the future?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>Who’s counting on us?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>Who cares about and depends on the quality, innovativeness, and efficiency of our efforts?</li>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> When people offer feedback, they’d like to know that you value this gift and that you intend to do something with it. Plan a conversation (or conversations) with your observers and plan to do the following: &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Thank your observers for their feedback.</li> 
                <li>Acknowledge what messages you heard and ask for any necessary clarification.</li>

               <ul> 
                <li>Think ahead of time about what you want to say and what you would like from the observers.</li>

As leaders we have a responsibility to ourselves and all our constituents to make sure we create a climate in which people can thrive when faced with change, adversity, challenge, and stress.&nbsp;<br> <br> The following is the second of six actionable strategies adapted from <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118911296.html" target="_blank"><em>Turning Adversity into Opportunity</em></a> that can help guide you.<br> <br> Identify a situation you and your constituents are currently facing. Reflect on the following questions. Make notes to yourself on how you can apply this strategy to what’s happening in your own life. And engage others you are working with in exploring how to broaden its application to address your collective challenge.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Strategy #2: &nbsp;Defy the Verdict &nbsp;</strong><br> People need to know what's really going on. They want to know the truth. And while resilient leaders “don't deny the diagnosis”, at the same time they "defy the verdict" of doom. &nbsp;<br> 
               <ul> 
                <li>What is going on right now?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>What is truth, and what is rumor?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>What are we clear and unclear about?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>How can you get clear?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>What is possible?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>Where’s the silver lining?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>How do we communicate the message that we can overcome these difficult circumstances?&nbsp;</li> 
                <li>What are some innovative opportunities that we can now explore?</li>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Building global relationships is essential to the success of today’s business. Entering new markets, expanding product offerings, and networking with new employees, suppliers and customers requires more than a cursory examination of the unfamiliar region’s culture. &nbsp;In fact, going in headstrong without the knowledge and understanding of a market and its people, such as the Australasian people, is a recipe for failure. That’s one of the most important reasons I collaborated with Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner to write <em><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-073031667X.html" target="_blank">Extraordinary Leadership in Australia and New Zealand: The Five Practices That Create Great Workplaces</a></em>. It was our aim to share the cultural issues leaders encounter in a region that requires a real sensitivity to our deep-seated history and the value we place on egalitarianism. We also wanted to raise awareness of the context in which successful business leaders operate and, most importantly, to offer tried and true solutions for overcoming some of the most common obstacles.<br> <br> <br> As a starting point then, as with all of Jim and Barry’s works, we began with research, surveying over 75,000 people in the workplace using the Leadership Practices Inventory® (LPI®). We wanted to know how effective workers felt their leader was. And while there are some differences between Australasians and other leaders around the world, we found leadership effectiveness directly related to how frequently respondents observed their leaders engaging in The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. We also identified several contextual issues that are key to the success of leaders operating in this part of the world.&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> One of the most deeply imbedded contextual issues is known as the “Tall Poppy Syndrome”. &nbsp;Dating back to the late 1800s, the Tall Poppy Syndrome characterizes a time when leaders were seen as lording their status and power over workers. Equating status and power with superiority, leaders were despised for “putting on superior airs” and, just like the tallest flowers in the field (or tall poppies), it is part of the Australasian ethos to cut those leaders down to the same size as all the others. The worst thing a leader can do in our culture is to assert authority based on position or title. This will ensure a guaranteed loss of employee engagement and stifle any chance of being seen as a trustworthy, effective leader. Anyone who desires to lead in this region must avoid even the slightest hint of hypocrisy and, as Jim and Barry have universally found in other cultures around the world, the most effective leaders fully embrace The Five Practices. They understand that relationships matter—what we call “Mateship”. They know how to be a valuable member of the team. They foster trust and self-determination. And they learn about the aspirations of others, creating a shared vision that inspires others to achieve the extraordinary.&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> The Five Practices have clearly been the catalyst for achieving greatness in Australia in the past. They also are destined to play an even more important role in helping leaders earn the right to lead in the future—the focus of an article Jim, Barry, and I recently co-authored for <em><a href="https://www.keymedia.com.au/publications/human-resources-director/61265" target="_blank">Human Resource Director</a></em> magazine. &nbsp;If you are looking for additional insight into the unique challenges—and opportunities—for leaders hoping to work and prosper in this dynamic region, I encourage you to read the full article, <em><a href="http://issuu.com/eacpc/stacks/7d60c9f2f4ad4555b6f4e023774e4209" target="_blank">Have You Earned the Right to Lead in Australia</a></em>?<br> <br> <br> <strong>Michael Bunting</strong>, Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge, is founder and managing director of WorkSmart Australia, a leadership development consultancy, and a guest lecturer in the University of Sydney’s award-winning Executive MBA program.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> A near fatal collapse during a routine morning run brings stressed-out businessman Michael face-to-face with a gentle soul and skilled carpenter known as J. This chance encounter develops into a life-changing opportunity as Michael comes to understand that this humble carpenter is skilled at building much more than just sturdy cabinets. He’s equally as skilled at building secure relationships, careers, and lives—just the help Michael and his challenging start-up tech business need to change direction.<br> <br> <em><a href=" http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470888547.html" target="_blank">The Carpenter</a></em> by bestselling author Jon Gordon follows the relationship between J. &nbsp;and Michael to illustrate a simple yet powerful model of leadership. This model, that J. calls “The Way”, represents three core principles—love, serve, and care—by which we live each day to the fullest and make the most of relationships. With this in mind, the story offers strong parallels to three of the Practices of The Leadership Challenge model: &nbsp;Model the Way, Enable Others to Act, and Inspire a Shared Vision.&nbsp;<br> <br> In Michael’s case, the potential of his technology start-up and family-run business failing is undeniably frightening. But by example, J. teaches Michael to let love, not fear, dictate his decisions. When you make love a standard for your business and constituents, J. advises, people come to understand that, “We can choose to slow down instead of rushing…we can take some deep breaths, focus on love and gratitude, and change how we approach the day and the people in our lives.” For Michael’s business to succeed, he realizes that he must Model the Way by establishing a foundation of love.<br> <br> The second principle, service, is how Michael can put love into action. J. explains that when you serve employees, customers, family or friends, you give them power. The more you invest in people, the more they will invest in you and your business. “When you love and serve others,” J. says, “you will become great in their eyes…they will respect and honor you. They will trust you.” As Michael applies encouragement and support to his own business model, he begins to understand the profound reward that comes when he Enables Others to Act.<br> <br> Addressing the third principle, caring, the author’s message is that it’s not enough to establish a trusting and loving foundation. Michael also must learn to Inspire a Shared Vision. “When you care, you will inspire others to care,” J. explains. And through their time together, J. teaches Michael both how to show people that you care and how to build a team that cares about one another.&nbsp;<br> <em><br> The Carpenter</em> is a simple and illustrative story that delivers a collection of powerful and far-reaching messages that will speak to all who embrace The Leadership Challenge. By building upon the Practices of Model the Way, Enable Others to Act, and Inspire a Shared Vision, this book illustrates how carpenters and businessmen alike can craft a leadership masterpiece.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Eli Becker </strong>is Senior Brand Assistant at Wiley where she oversees The Leadership Challenge presence on social media, assists in marketing the brand, and helps to build and maintain The Leadership Challenge website.&nbsp;<br>

               </div> Once you have firmly established the principles and Practices of The Leadership Challenge in your for-profit company, what can you do to truly bring those shared values to life in your community? &nbsp;How about creating a private foundation? &nbsp;That is what we are doing at my company, Kaneka Corporation, a multi-billion dollar chemical manufacturer based in Japan with subsidiaries around the world.&nbsp;<br> <br> My commitment to Kaneka began 23 year ago when I joined the company as a process engineer at the Pasadena, Texas facility. &nbsp;In 2002 I became the plant Site Manager. And in 2007, when I discovered The Leadership Challenge, I quickly brought it to the plant management team. &nbsp;Since then we have been working to integrate The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® within our own group and to spread the knowledge we’ve gained to other Kaneka facilitates around the world. &nbsp;The Kaneka Foundation is our latest creation and a bold step in taking our values beyond the limits of the company. &nbsp;<br> <br> Like any responsible company, Kaneka had developed a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy that defines our commitment to various stakeholders, including employees, the community, investors, customers, vendors, and the environment. &nbsp;And it was that CSR commitment which was the impetus for this new nonprofit venture. To focus more attention on the company’s outward efforts, I looked around to find like-minded colleagues who could help me get this initiative off the ground. Fortunately, I found capable partners in administration, human resources, operations, and finance—both local U.S. senior managers and Japanese expatriates—who joined me in developing a proposal that was ultimately presented to the Board of Directors. &nbsp;<br> <br> For us at Kaneka, getting the board’s approval in Japan on anything is always a challenge. However, according to one of my Japanese colleagues, this was the easiest proposal ever passed. Why? &nbsp;It was very simply a matter of trust. &nbsp;You see, our current Chairman of the Board in Japan, Mr. Kimikazu Sugawara, used to be the President of Kaneka Texas Corporation in the 90s. &nbsp;And it is that long-standing relationship and trust built over many years that I credit for this success.&nbsp;<br> <br> 
               <div style="text-align: left;">
                <span style="font-size: 12px;">So with the Board’s approval, in early 2014 we launched the creation of our private foundation to be headquartered at our offices in Pasadena, Texas. Today The Kaneka Foundation’s mission is to promote and facilitate charitable works in the advancement of four key areas: education, environment, health, and social services. And in an effort to closely tie the Foundation’s areas of influence with those of the corporation, most of the organizations we have supported to-date are well aligned with the global corporate strategy that internally we all know as “Kaneka United”: &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 
                 <div style="text-align: center;">
                  <img alt="" src="http://webany.net/Sites/wiley-tlc/UserFiles/Kaneka%20United%20image.png" style="font-size: 12px; width: 325px; height: 144px;">

               <div style="text-align: center;">
                <span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span>
               </div> With the vision of being a source of inspiration and pride for all Kaneka employees, The Kaneka Foundation is driven by its commitment to having a positive impact on the lives of millions of people around the world. &nbsp;We make charitable contributions to other 501 (c)3 organizations and provide grants for natural disaster relief. We promote employee volunteerism through Kaneka KARES and will be offering grants to employees to promote volunteerism in the community. In addition, we offer opportunities for corporate scholarships.<br> <br> Although we are still quite young (as corporations go), we have already made a difference with sponsorships and participation in a number of key areas, including:&nbsp;<br> <br> 
               <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Kaneka%20image_ca3.png" style="width: 450px; height: 150px;">
               </div> &nbsp;<br> Building the mission and focus of The Kaneka Foundation upon the powerful philosophy of The Leadership Challenge, we have been able to align our actions with our shared values, giving everyone in the Kaneka organization an opportunity to connect their personal values with the shared values we all support—in the end, increasing commitment and engagement. &nbsp;Employee volunteerism is a big part of the projects we sponsor and inspiring our team to get involved in the communities where we live brings more pride to individuals and our organization. &nbsp;I have been delighted to see the strong positive reaction from employees upon hearing about the creation of The Kaneka Foundation and for months have been flooded with ideas and suggestions for future projects.<br> <br> Another positive outcome of the foundation has been teambuilding. These philanthropic projects are creating unique opportunities for Kaneka employees to come together and build stronger relationships. &nbsp;And as we in The Leadership Challenge community know, building relationships leads to building trust…which leads to collaboration…which leads to results—in our case, for the foundation and, ultimately, for Kaneka Corporation on a global scale. For example, we recently participated in a local Habitat for Humanity build project. A group of employees who knew little about each other came together and spent the day painting a house. Throughout the day, I could see folks talking, laughing, and working together in ways that would not be possible at the plant site. In addition, several of our Japanese expatriate employees attended and experienced something completely new. &nbsp;I am hopeful that as our efforts and the impact of the foundation grow, the volunteer spirit will be a valuable export from the U.S. to other countries where Kaneka employees live and work. &nbsp;That is our vision: to be a source of inspiration and pride for all Kaneka employees.<br> <br> By creating and growing The Kaneka Foundation, I hope that we can provide more opportunities to Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act, and Encourage the Heart for our employees and for others throughout our communities. &nbsp; I also hope that we can be an inspiration to other corporations to consider a similar path for their own private foundation.<br> <br> <strong> Steve Skarke</strong> is President of The Kaneka Foundation and creator of Leading Elements™.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Adverse and challenging times can bring out the best in organizations and individuals. They can also bring out the worst. As leaders we have a responsibility to ourselves and all our constituents to make sure we create a climate in which people can thrive when faced with change, adversity, challenge, and stress. The following is the first of six actionable strategies adapted from <em><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118911296.html" target="_blank">Turning Adversity into Opportunity</a></em>
               <http:>
                &nbsp;that can help guide you. Identify a situation you and your constituents are currently facing. Reflect on the following questions. Make notes to yourself on how you can apply this strategy to what’s happening in your own life. And engage others you are working with in exploring how to broaden its application to address your collective challenge. 
                <br> 
                <br> Strategy #1: Broaden the Context This challenge is occurring in a larger context. Change and transition have happened before. Adversity has been overcome.

                <ul> 
                 <li><span style="font-size: 12px;">What's the bigger picture here?&nbsp;</span></li> 
                 <li><span style="font-size: 12px;">How can we help others understand what's happening in the environment and how it is affecting the business?</span></li> 
                 <li><span style="font-size: 12px;">How can we educate others about the broader context?&nbsp;</span></li> 
                 <li><span style="font-size: 12px;">How can we get people to see that we’re not any worse off than others before us?</span></li> 
                 <li><span style="font-size: 12px;">How do we give people time and space to discuss their answers and gain perspective?</span></li> 
                 <li><span style="font-size: 12px;">What can we do to frame what is happening and what is being done in ways that give people hope?&nbsp;</span></li>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> My Dad was a U.S. Air Force Captain. Growing up I saw first-hand the sacrifices the brave men and women in our military make to protect lives and freedom. And I learned to respect, support, and appreciate all those who selflessly serve. Today, I am passionate about supporting our veterans in every way I can—especially as a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge—and learning more from the stories they tell. So, as you might expect, I read Chris Kyle’s autobiography, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Sniper-Autobiography-Military-History/dp/0062238868/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423778622&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=american+sniper" target="_blank">American Sniper</a></em>, and couldn’t wait for the <a href="http://www.americansnipermovie.com" target="_blank">movie</a> to be released. &nbsp;<br> <br> <br> Having now read his book and also watched his life portrayed on screen, I consider Chris Kyle to be a true American hero. &nbsp;Without entering into the politics that now surround his story or making any type of commentary on war, I see Chris as a real leader who clearly demonstrated The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> Model the Way requires that we explore how values guide our actions and behaviors, help define our philosophy of leadership, and shape our vision. &nbsp;From my view, Chris had a strong sense of purpose and he seemed very clear about what was important to him:&nbsp;<br> <br> 
               <ul> 
                <li><span style="font-size: 12px;">Freedom and Independence… as evidenced by Chris enlisting in the U.S. Navy Seals despite being denied the first time because of metal screws in his wrist from a rodeo accident&nbsp;<br> <br> </span></li> 
                <li><span style="font-size: 12px;">Integrity…reflected in how hard he trained to be his best<br> <br> </span></li> 
                <li><span style="font-size: 12px;">Humility… seen in his discomfort at being called “The Legend” and being recognized for what he saw as just doing his job<br> <br> </span></li> 
                <li><span style="font-size: 12px;">Family… as he continually put himself in harms way to protect his loved ones at home and his brothers and sisters in-country<br> <br> </span></li> 
                <li><span style="font-size: 12px;">Faith and Spirituality… evidenced by his priorities of God, country, family<br> <br> </span></li> 
                <li><span style="font-size: 12px;">Service… demonstrated by his enlistment, honorable service, angst in not returning for a fifth tour, and selfless giving to veterans back home&nbsp;</span></li> 
               </ul> I believe this clarity of values guided Chris in his vision as a U.S. Navy Seal, as a husband, as a father, and as a friend. In addition to shaping his vision of keeping Americans, allies, and civilians safe, these values also guided him in taking risks. For example, there is a scene in the movie where Chris is on “overwatch” (when a sniper takes a high position, such as on a rooftop, to protect troops from a surprise attack in the streets). &nbsp;Because insurgents had begun ambushing Marines inside small rooms and hallways to avoid snipers outside, Chris chooses to join a patrol unit doing house-to-house searches. His desire to join the troops on the ground was fueled by his belief that if he Challenged the Process and shared some of the specialized techniques he’d learned as a U.S. Navy Seal (like room clearances), this new knowledge might build confidence and competence—a key element in Enabling Others to Act. In the end, Chris hoped he might help the troops stay alive.&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> Back home, Chris continued to focus on giving back to help others grow and develop. &nbsp;He mentored—by example— in the volunteer work he did with wounded veterans, especially those experiencing combat stress and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). Inspired by fellow Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell and his Lone Survivor Foundation, Chris organized outings and ranch retreats for disabled servicemen. He also continued to challenge himself and others, Inspiring a Shared Vision and starting the company <a href="www.craftintl.com" target="_blank">Craft International</a>. Through customized training he developed for members of law enforcement and the military, he shared important lessons he had learned as he helped others develop new skills and tools that could save lives.&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> I believe that with Chris’ book, he really tried to increase our awareness and understanding of the challenges our veterans face—especially to raise awareness among those not familiar with what the lives of military families are all about. &nbsp;And now I hope the movie (which faithfully holds true to his book but was made after his untimely death) inspires all of us to Encourage the Heart of the brave men and women who have served—and continue to serve—whether that service is defending and protecting in times of conflict, assisting with food and humanitarian efforts after disasters and outbreaks, or providing rescue operations and medical assistance wherever in the world help is required. And to help get you started on Encouraging the Heart, here are a few ideas:&nbsp;<br> <br> <br> 1. When you see someone in uniform, say “Thank you”. If they want to talk, ask what they do, and listen. &nbsp;<br> <br> 2. Send care packages with a personal note of gratitude and appreciation.&nbsp;<br> <br> 3. If you know someone who just returned from deployment, invite him or her to dinner or offer to babysit so they have an evening alone with their loved one.<br> <br> 4. Check out <a href="www.AmericasMightyWarriors.org" target="_blank">America’s Mighty Warriors</a>, an organization created by Debbie Lee, mother of Chris’s friend and fellow Charlie Platoon Navy SEAL Marc Lee.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Exemplary leaders don’t rest on their laurels or rely on their natural talents; instead, they continually do more to improve themselves. So if you want to be the best you can be, you need to become a great learner. To get the most learning out of the 360-degree feedback process using the Leadership Practices Inventory<sup>®</sup>, value the differences in your observers’ perspectives. You’re a multi‑dimensional person, and your feedback ought to be multi‑dimensional as well. You work with people from a variety of backgrounds and from a variety of functions and organizations. Feedback from these multiple perspectives helps you see how you lead across groups and situations. The feedback from each observer helps you build a more complete picture of how effective you are as a leader.<br> <br> <br> Excerpted from Leadership Practices Inventory<sup>®</sup> Workbook, 4th edition.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>As leaders, facilitators, or coaches, we all have some idea of the impact we can have on others. What we say and how it’s delivered surely can change a person’s behaviour in the moment. But our personal interactions with others—whether professionally or personally—can also be life-changing in the long term. That’s especially true when we put into action the specific behaviours associated with what I see as one of the most important of Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®: Encourage the Heart.&nbsp; This is a lesson that was brought home to me most recently during a memorial service for a long-ago colleague and friend. </p> <p> Originally from Australia, I currently live and work in the Middle East, in Dubai, but was back in my home-country after a protracted absence. As it happens, unexpectedly someone who worked for me some 20+ years ago had passed away the day before I arrived. Although we hadn't been in regular contact, his partner emailed me to pass on the news and to ask if there was anyone from all those years ago who could speak at the service.&nbsp; It became clear my return was timely and I was very pleased to accept the honour myself.&nbsp; </p> <p>The heart-warming memorial service was held on a bleak, wintry day in my former hometown of Melbourne, attended by friends from his varied theatrical and television career. As I had also had a career in the television field as a producer of prime-time drama, I began my tribute by describing how I had first come to know our friend and colleague, when I was asked to take him on as a director. Although I was more than a little reluctant at first, I came to see our friend for the exemplary leader he was, how over time he developed as a leader, the positive impact he had on those around him, and how he continually pushed his own creativity as well as the creativity of others. </p> <p>On reflection, much of what I spoke about during my tribute was how our mutual friend Modelled the Way and, as a result, how others developed a deep respect for him; how his attitude and what he spoke about inspired others and how he Challenged the Process—challenging himself and those around him to go higher, to deliver better results. I told his gathered friends of the significant trust and respect that I developed with him, as his leader.<br> <br> After the service finished, I was approached by two former colleagues. It had been a long time since we worked together and even as they shook my hand and said their names, I still had trouble remembering more than a few fleeting details about them. But as we caught up on what we had all been doing with our lives one of them said something which absolutely shows how Encourage the Heart resonates—has an often huge impact on the other person, not just in the moment but <strong>significantly </strong>beyond that.<br> <br> He said to me, "Graham, I still have memos you wrote to me telling me how pleased you were with the work I’d done on particular episodes."<br> <br> <strong>Wow, </strong>I was incredulous! At least 25 years later he still remembered how I encouraged his heart! Did I remember sending those memos, which he still has?&nbsp; Of course not. <em>(Some of us might struggle to remember what a 'memo' was ...)</em> But the lessons from that encounter are very clear to me: the impact of what we do and what we say stays with the other person long after that moment has passed and long after the person who said it has gone. Of course I remember even from back then when my own heart was encouraged. What I didn't expect, such a long time later, was that what <strong><em>I'd</em></strong><em> </em>done to Encourage the Heart of another would still be remembered—and kept.<br> <br> What a gift this former colleague gave me after all those years, telling me that he still remembered what I did.&nbsp; His simple comment to me was a powerful reminder of the impact we have as leaders when we Encourage the Heart—especially for those we’re leading but also with all those who come into our sphere of influence.</p> <p> What a lesson this is for leaders everywhere. What you say and what you do stays behind, like footprints in the sand. As leaders, we have to make sure they're the 'footprints' we want to leave. And, as leaders, we have a choice in that.</p> <p> So often the leaders I'm working with struggle to Encourage the Heart for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that others have not encouraged <em>their </em>heart. If only all aspiring leaders could grasp the idea that when you do this, it can resonate in the heart of the other person for such a long time and deliver such great results.<br> <br> </p> <p><strong>Graham Moor</strong>e is the first Certified Master for The Leadership Challenge in the Middle East.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p><span>Recently I spoke about leading change in challenging times to a group of child welfare professionals. As I was saying goodbye to one leader in particular who stood out for the difficult challenge she was facing, I experienced a truly ‘aha’ moment. This leader told me of her renewed commitment to push local government and law enforcement officials to address the growing problem of heroin abuse in her Southeast Indiana community. Her passion and the potential impact of her work impressed and humbled me. And when I thanked her for working to make her community better, she also surprised me by responding, "You inspired me." </span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This may sound funny coming from someone who makes a living as a Certified Master for The Leadership Challenge®, but it's not a natural state for me to&nbsp;want to be&nbsp;<strong><em>inspiring</em></strong>. I want people to see their own potential and&nbsp;I want others to&nbsp;<strong><em>be inspired.</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp; </em></strong>In fact, when I’m facilitating a workshop I spend the majority of time<strong> </strong>talking about leaders who inspire others and sharing ways that the leaders in the group can do that, too. But as&nbsp;a person who tends toward introversion, I don't&nbsp;feel the need to be front and center, or&nbsp;an inspiration to others. I&nbsp;don't aspire&nbsp;to give rousing performances for an audience. </span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That said, one of my core beliefs is that people want to contribute to something greater than themselves. I <em>do</em> want to help leaders help others get to where they feel that they are a part of something bigger—to be inspired by that bigger picture.&nbsp;So, in the end, the gift I received in my ‘aha’ moment was a reminder that I do indeed&nbsp;have to work at inspiring others. It also reminded me of what I've learned from Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner: that we inspire others when we're inspired. </span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While we may think that the stereotypical "charismatic leader" may be the only one capable of inspiring people, we each have a passion that we can&nbsp;tap into&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;enlist people in&nbsp;what we believe can&nbsp;make a difference in the world. Charisma isn't limited to the great leaders like Martin Luther King. You show charisma when you talk about something you truly care&nbsp;about—be it work, a political issue, your children, or even a favorite vacation. You show charisma when you </span><a href="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/Leaders-Section-Articles-Stories-Detail/inspire-a-shared-vision-inspiring-hope-the-noun.aspx" target="_blank" title="Inspiring a Shared Vision of Hope"><span>speak—with conviction—about the meaning of your work, your world.&nbsp;</span></a> </p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The challenge for all of us as leaders is to ask ourselves, “What am I passionate about and how can I deploy that passion to make the world better?”</span></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Renee Harness</strong> is founder of Harness Leadership and a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge®.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p><em>“<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/61107.Margaret_Mead" target="_blank">Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has</a>.”? Margaret Mead&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Working in this field of leadership development, every once in a while we get the chance to work with aspiring leaders and organisations that are truly destined to make a difference, to make our world—now and for generations to come—a better place. For me, that experience is embodied in the leadership coaching work I’ve been privileged to undertake for eight years with a group in East London called the Active Change Foundation and the organisation’s founder, Hanif Qadir.&nbsp;</p> <p>Those who were fortunate to attend the 2013 Leadership Forum in Scottsdale, AZ may remember Hanif and young Samiuel who together presented a session on the organisations’ Young Leaders Programme (YLP). Well, since that time Hanif, Sammy, and the rest of the young leaders at ACF have been very busy—raising their voices and Modelling the Way to make a change in the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Appalled by the recent activities of the Islamic State (IS) organisation, in particular the barbaric acts of violence like those reported in such U.S. newspapers as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/06/13/isis-beheadings-and-the-success-of-horrifying-violence/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a><span>&nbsp;, H</span>anif and the ACF team wanted to ensure that young people in their local communities—especially those vulnerable to radicalisation themselves—understood that the actions and behaviours of IS in no way represent good Islamic practice. Their view was that what the members of IS were doing was the <em>antithesis</em> of Islam. They also shared a belief that the only way to defeat the radical elements of Islam is for the moderate voice to prevail. They wanted to DO something. But from their youth centre in East London, the question was “what?”.&nbsp;</p> <p>Their knowledge of and confidence in Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®&nbsp;helped&nbsp;strengthened&nbsp;their resolve to act.&nbsp;They decided to launch a social media campaign that has gone viral. From the streets of London to cities across the U.S., “Notinmyname” has become a unifying focus for Muslims everywhere who share a sense of outrage at how ISIL has hijacked their faith.&nbsp; The<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYanI-zJes" target="_blank"> ACF’s “Notinmyname” YouTube video</a>&nbsp;has been viewed more than 250,000 times in just the first three weeks!&nbsp;</p> <p>President Barak Obama, in his recent address to the United Nations General Assembly, paid tribute to the work of these young leaders.&nbsp;</p> <p>"The ideology of ISIL or al Qaeda or Boko Haram will wilt and die if it is consistently exposed, confronted, and refuted in the light of day. Look at the new Forum&nbsp;for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies – Sheikh bin Bayyah described its purpose: “We must declare war on war, so the outcome will be peace upon peace.”&nbsp;<strong>Look at the young British Muslims, who responded to terrorist propaganda by starting the “notinmyname” campaign, declaring – “ISIS is hiding behind a false&nbsp;Islam.”</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>British Prime Minister David Cameron also has mentioned&nbsp;in the British Parliament&nbsp;the work of Hanif and the team from ACF&nbsp;as he described the importance of a credible counter-narrative to Islamic Fundamentalism coming from within their own community. And within the local communities in London, it most importantly has engaged both moderate and radical Muslims and Christians in a debate about the kind of community they want to build.</p> <p>These young leaders of ACF have found their voices and, even more importantly, have found the courage to speak up in a deeply divided community. No doubt there will be consequences, both good and inevitably bad. But this is exemplary leadership at its best—great leaders I think we all can learn something from.</p> <p>On a final personal note, my experience with this incredible group of young leaders has made me ever more thoughtful about what leadership will look like for the Y&amp;Z generations. We’ve seen a glimpse of that future over the last few weeks on social media and I believe it has profound implications for us as leadership educators.</p> <p><strong>Chris Nel</strong> is a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Every year, Seetec—one of the UK’s largest providers of government-funded employment and skills training programmes—helps thousands of people gain qualifications and find employment. &nbsp;Delivering a wide range of Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and Jobcentre Plus employment programmes, the company works closely with employers and partner organisations to empower individuals with the skills they need to move off benefits and into sustainable employment. With well-established roots in IT consultancy services, Seetec also supports employers with recruitment, training, and IT solutions, implementing customized, cutting-edge systems for businesses. </p> <p>Helping individuals develop the skills they need to succeed—in life and work—is at the very heart of Seetec’s ethos. So creating a People Development Department in 2012 to focus on the training and development of the company’s own talented staff was a natural progression for this innovative organisation. Within a year, a learning culture was taking root and the department had created a multitude of learning and development interventions to ensure that staff had a clear career path and routes for internal promotion. One of these successful programmes was the Leadership Academy that uses <em>The Leadership Challenge</em> as the foundation for empowering Seetec staff with the essential skills of effective leadership. </p> <p>Leadership Academy participants are nominated by Senior Management to attend The Leadership Challenge® Workshop—a two-day residential course where attendees have the opportunity to fully explore The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. Prior to attending, participants, their line managers, direct reports, and co-workers complete the Leadership Practices®360 (LPI®360) feedback questionnaire. Upon arrival at the workshop, attendees are provided with a full 360 report that helps identify their areas of strengths and those that need improvement. The following two days consist of a series of sessions, supported by <em>The Leadership Challenge</em> book and companion workbook, that explore in-depth each of The Five Practices so that participants can really focus on steps they can take to more frequently practice the behaviours of exemplary leaders in order to become more effective leaders themselves. </p> <p>Now into its second year, the structure of the Leadership Academy has expanded to include additional learning components (e.g., self-directed learning, a coaching course). Attendees follow up the two-day Leadership Challenge® Workshop with a management qualification component (L2-L7, relevant to the manager’s level) from the U.K.’s Chartered Management Institute. This additional course of study further supports <em>The Leadership Challenge</em> Practices and principles, and certifies participants as a qualified manager and leader.&nbsp; Going forward, attendees also receive continued support on their on-going leadership challenges and are encouraged to regularly put The Five Practices&nbsp; into action through email bulletins, coaching, mentoring and completion of reports where they recognise and record ways they have demonstrated a particular Practice. </p> <p>The Leadership Academy initially offered Manager-level staff the opportunity to take charge of their development and help them reach their career goals while also helping Seetec ensure that talented individuals remained within the business. Now the programme reaches across the entire organization—from the initial group of junior managers to executives and members of the Board of Directors—to include all levels of leadership. The Leadership Academy’s structure currently looks like this:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/workshoptable.PNG"><br> <br> </p> <p>Seven cohorts of 12 managers have attended the Leadership Academy to-date—that’s 84 managers at varying levels within the business! And feedback has been very positive, such as what one Spring Board participant wrote: </p> <p>“Imagine this: Your life is great. Everything is moving along beautifully. Then, out of nowhere, something unexpected happens. As a result, you feel inspired, motivated, enthusiastic, creative, supported, understood and, ultimately, you feel brand new—all in two days. That’s what <em>The Leadership Challenge </em>did for me.”</p> <p>The Leadership Academy has certainly delivered within its first year of implementation. Seetec has already seen a positive impact on the business and management retention rates have increased as program participants now feel supported and challenged and can see a clear career pathway. We hope to have all of our managers experience the Leadership Academy within the next year and look toward further embedding a culture of learning throughout the organisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Seetec-Logo_Blue_173.gif" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 70px; height: 100px;"><br> <br> <br> <p>To learn more about the Seetec Leadership Academy program, visit <a href="http://youtu.be/OewXgxrRy-w" target="_blank"><span>http://youtu.be/OewXgxrRy-w</span></a></p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Claire Maslan</strong>, AIEP, AlfL, is People Development Manager at Seetec where she oversees the management and delivery of all learning and development to members of the Seetec staff.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>When people are forced to leave their homes due to war, violence, or famine, they carry little with them but hope for a better future. Dotted across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and other parts of the world, there are refugee camps filled with families with a desire to improve their lives yet without the tools to do so. Many reside at these camps for years, struggling to get even the most basic necessities for their families. So, how can these families go from basic survival to improving their lives and communities? And what can mission-driven organizations do to help? </p> <p>The Society of Jesus, a religious order within the Catholic Church, is one of these mission-driven organizations trying to find solutions. Its members, known as Jesuits, are especially well known for their focus on education and social justice. Jesuit Commons: Higher Education at the Margins(JC:HEM) is an initiative of the Society of Jesus,&nbsp; dedicated to bringing higher education to refugees and others who live at the margins where they are unserved, or underserved by higher education. Open to people of all faiths, the JC:HEM program mobilizes the resources of the worldwide network of Jesuit and other universities to bring higher education to those who need it most. &nbsp;</p> <p>Understanding the challenges that refugees face is to understand the mission of JC:HEM. According to Dr. Mary McFarland, JC:HEM International Director, “We know there is a domino effect from low education to high poverty to high conflict. If we tip this equation in those regions by making higher education accessible, will that lead to a decrease in poverty and a decrease in conflict? Even though it may take 20 to 30 years, those of us who have worked with these students believe it is possible.”</p> <p>Refugee camps are filled with people of different races, ethnicities, and religions. Refugees arrive with little, if anything, and often from opposing warring tribes. They must find a way to live peacefully, side- by-side, leaving behind old prejudices while wondering about the fate of the homes, families, and friends. In addition, camp life has its own struggles. Basic needs—such as quality sanitation, plentiful food, and safe, potable water—are difficult to meet. Refugees face overwhelming odds, both physically and mentally. </p> <p>In the midst of all this hardship is where JC:HEM has stepped in to provide opportunities for learning that offers these survivors a chance for a brighter future—for themselves and their families. JC:HEM’s mission is to provide eager learners with the knowledge they need to thrive both as community members of the refugee camps and as skilled individuals capable of excelling in a variety of types of work. And it has built a curriculum focused on liberal studies and also on practical skills.&nbsp; The Diploma in Liberal Studies is awarded by Regis University, Denver Colorado, and several different universities award certificate-level programs. This education empowers students to reclaim their sense-of-self and take a leadership role in their communities. </p> <p>Faculty from over 36 universities—primarily from the U.S. as well as from Mexico, Spain, India, Europe, and Africa—work with JC:HEM to provide courses online to refugees at camps in Malawi, Kenya, Chad, and to urban refugees in Jordan. One online class, created specifically to help refugees develop essential leadership skills, uses <em>The Leadership Challenge </em>as the core text. And currently, professors from U.S. universities such as Georgetown and Boston College are using The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® model to teach cohorts of approximately 30 students each. </p> <p>Neil Sparnon, the JC:HEM Academic Coordinator, sees a strong connection between the JC:HEM mission and <em>The Leadership Challenge. </em>In his words, he views the leadership class as “one of the most important classes offered” as it prepares students to “apply and deploy skills in their own services.” The key link that he and others at JC:HEM see between their mission and <em>The Leadership Challenge</em> is the emphasis on leadership in action. </p> <p>As students learn leadership principles, they are able to apply them right away as leadership opportunities abound in these refugee camps. Domique, for example, is one individual who has taken a leadership role in his camp. After completing his JC:HEM program, he began to work as a water and sanitation monitor. He instructs others on how to prevent the spread of disease through proper use of hand washing and the correct way to obtain fresh, clean water. He encourages those he teaches to educate their families and neighbors (Enabling Others to Act) to make the camps safer and keep residents healthy. &nbsp;According to Domique, “Sanitation has improved in the community as the camp now has people who have been educated in that field. I feel more helpful in the community because I have something that I can give. Thanks to JC:HEM for assisting me and other refugees with more skills and improving our way of looking at life.”</p> <p>Peter, after completing his leadership course, started volunteering as President of the Dzaleka Sanitation Committee coordinated by the Office of the United Nations Higher Commissioner for Refugees. From increasing access to clean water to ensuring that new toilets were installed, Peter faced many challenges. But in his new role, Peter became a guide for others (Modelling the Way) to be both a member of a community and a leader. Peter is now employed as a health surveillance assistant at the Dzaleka Health Centre where he helps to immunize children and teach about water and sanitation in the community and camp. </p> <p>Inette, another JC:HEM graduate and the only female carpenter at her refugee camp in&nbsp; Dzaleka, Kenya, also found ways to quickly apply her new leadership skills to address challenges and Enable Others to Act. From a workshop that she opened, she makes furniture and sells wood to other carpenters in the camp. She also has taught business skills to other women, to help them create small businesses of their own. Of her new role, she says, “I feel that JC:HEM has given me more value in the community, and I have gained knowledge that helps me do something for community and my family.”</p> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Kakuma-Camp-graduatesKenya.png" class="image_Float_Right" style="width: 224px; height: 300px;"> <p> Last year, JC:HEM celebrated a momentous occasion: graduation of the first cohort of students. Extending beyond the graduates to their families, friends, and community, there was much to celebrate. As the program graduates take on leadership roles in their communities, life there improves. They find that their newly-gained wisdom is trusted and valued by their peers. Program graduates, who have studied side-by-side with those from different backgrounds, are natural peacemakers. They are invited to help solve inter-religious and inter-ethnic conflicts that emerge. And their new-found leadership skills and confidence ripple through the community, encouraging more and more people to focus on improving camp life and living peacefully together.</p> <p>JC:HEM students have now received the gift of knowledge and they want to use it to help themselves, their families, their communities. </p>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Research about and application of The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® remains vibrant and growing, as all of us who attended last month’s The Leadership Challenge Forum 2014 in New Orleans are aware.&nbsp; In fact, the focus of this year’s conference was specifically around the Practice of Challenge the Process. Recognizing, confronting and overcoming adversity were clearly key sub-themes that were addressed in nearly every breakout session, skill-building session, and the great keynotes. And everyone received a copy of Jim and Barry’s latest short-form book and e-book, <em>Turning Adversity into Opportunity,</em> which tied directly to the theme of the Forum (also providing evidence that, as usual, the authors had been doing their homework between conferences). </p> <p>Here are a few other highlights and personal reflections from my experience this year: </p> <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two things I most appreciate about Jim and Barry’s approach: &nbsp;they continue to do research to help us all keep learning; and then they provide us with relevant and actionable options—not impressive-sounding but unusable theory. The Leadership Challenge model and the annual Forums are truly geared toward Enabling Others to Act, not just providing interesting but non-applicable knowledge.</p> <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Symbolically, New Orleans was a perfect location given what the people there have had to overcome throughout the past few years. No matter how much all of us outsiders think we might know about Katrina, the people of New Orleans (and the Gulf Coast) have had a much different experience than we can imagine. A remarkable and heartwarming sense of history and pride exists in that city.</p> <p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Forum offered a number of terrific learning opportunities. Jim and Barry, once again, happily gave up the stage to a couple of other authors: Bill Treasurer, author of <a href="http://www.pfeiffer.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-813534.html" target="_blank"><em>Courageous Leadership</em></a>, shared lessons and insights from his ongoing work on leading with courage; Jennifer Robin, author of <em><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118352424.html"> No Excuses</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470596260.html"><em>The Great Workplace</em></a>, helped everyone learn about what it takes to create a great workplace. Courage is part of dealing with adversity and it takes courage to confront the unchallengeable norms in a workplace in order to make it better. I always appreciate being exposed to the additive work of other researchers and authors, which is so often a great benefit of attending The Leadership Challenge Forum.</p> <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The closing activity was an example of experiential learning at its best. To be in New Orleans and have a jazz ensemble rocking the room would have been grand enough by itself. But along with some great music, we were able to learn some powerful lessons about New Orleans traditions and music, songwriting, and collaboration. It was amazing to watch how the energy level continued to soar and how that energy, along with the lessons learned, was harnessed into an immediate result. We learned, we delivered, and we thoroughly enjoyed. Imagine that combination in your workplace every day!</p> <p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This may be my most important reflection. If there is one value that was immensely modeled at the Forum, it was generosity. Jim and Barry were very accessible and generous with their time and knowledge. All of the speakers, including the breakout session leaders, were generous in sharing what they know and what they have learned. Master Facilitators looked forward to sharing what they could with attendees who wanted and needed advice and knowledge. And our host, Wiley Publishing, continued to show great generosity in supporting the Masters Give Back program. &nbsp;Several leaders from nonprofit organizations in the New Orleans area were provided the <em>gift</em> of The Leadership Challenge® Workshop this year, thanks to the generosity of Wiley and the many Master Facilitators who donated time and money to support these deserving nonprofit leaders. It is a joy for me to see this value so abundantly displayed.</p> <p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My final reflection is this: The Leadership Challenge community is not just a group of people from around the world who enjoy common work and like to come together to socialize around it once a year. Rather, it is a well-intentioned, focused community whose members are all deeply committed to the work of leadership development. There is a real power in this community. For years, many of us have seen the impact The Leadership Challenge has had on individual people and organizations of all kinds. And this impact is expanding worldwide, including places like Asia, Africa, and Australia (to alliteratively name a few). There are members of the community devoted to helping students become exposed to leadership at earlier ages and, as a result, perhaps changing their futures forever. And consider this…there is Leadership Challenge work being done in the Middle East, which with time and its accumulating, visible results could actually become a factor for future peace and interdependence. It is a privilege to be part of a community that makes such a difference for so many people.</p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> &nbsp;In 2015, we will gather in San Francisco, June 18–19, to continue strengthening our collective desire to grow leaders and, yes, even change the world.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>For all those familiar with The Leadership Challenge, we know that the most important starting point for values-driven leadership (or any leadership, for that matter) is to have an awareness of self: the values that guide us as individuals which, ultimately, impact our organizations, our communities, our world.&nbsp; And it is that focus and learning that participants in a recent workshop, sponsored by the Hamilton County Leadership Academy (HCLA), experienced in a unique way. </p> <p>HCLA is a community leadership development program dedicated to helping those in leadership positions continue to develop their capabilities as leaders. Representing a variety of organizations from Hamilton County in Indiana, participants come to the program from various backgrounds—all seeking education and information about the Hamilton County community as well as opportunities to build on their leadership skills.</p> <p>As part of HCLA’s commitment to providing ways for both current participants and alumnae to stay connected and continue their development as leaders, one of the organization’s key offerings is a continuing education workshop held each spring for alumnae. Here, leaders return to the HCLA community to share their experiences, and spend a morning focusing on ways to more fully develop their leadership skills, both personally and professionally. </p> <p>While this Values-Driven Leadership Workshop, in many settings, may have focused only on organizational values, HCLA has always recognized the importance of individual leaders exploring their own personal values.&nbsp; That’s why this innovative session focuses first on personal values, and then turns to a panel of recognized local leaders to demonstrate the interplay between a leader’s personal values and organizational values.</p> <p>For example, during the most recent workshop held earlier this year, leaders spent the first several hours exploring personal values with an exercise adapted from the Values Card Sort provided in The Leadership Challenge Values Cards Facilitator Guide. Leaders identified the personal values that mattered most to them and created definitions for each that would help guide them in their daily leadership. This exploration was both illuminating and reflective. And when participants shared their values with each other, the room was abuzz!&nbsp; </p> <p>To our surprise, this first exercise went more quickly than we had planned—perhaps because these leaders were so committed to the community they were already very in tune to the values that truly mattered to them and were quick to narrow down their values. With extra time on our hands before the panel leaders arrived, we didn’t want to ignore the opportunity for more learning. So we added an extra bonus for this group’s participants and engaged leaders in developing a personal leadership philosophy.&nbsp; </p> <p>As many of us within the TLC community understand, having a leadership philosophy—one that arises from our values—often has more impact than we ever expect. This was the case with attendee Chris Owens, Director of Indiana Parks and Recreation Association, who was surprised that this simple process of exploring personal values and using those to create his leadership philosophy made such an impact. In fact, he was so excited that he posted about his leadership philosophy on Facebook, writing: </p> <p>“I wrote a leadership philosophy statement yesterday as part of the workshop I attended. Still needs some polishing, but happy with draft #1. I’m being highly challenged to follow that in several facets today.” </p> <p>Workshop participants also shared their leadership philosophies with others in the group before being treated to a panel discussion that included executives from Hamilton and nearby Marion counties who told stories and provided insight into the personal values that drive their behavior and actions as leaders, as well as how their organizations use values to positively impact results. </p> <p>Mike Strohl, VP of Client Service and Customer Relations at Citizens Energy Group in Indianapolis, for example, gave an excellent example of how employees, in the midst of a potentially serious crisis in the middle of the worst winter the Midwest had ever seen, brought the company’s organizational values to life:&nbsp; </p> <p>During the extreme cold of the Polar Vortex in January, on the coldest night of the year when the wind chill was -30 degrees, a valve broke on one of the liquefied natural gas tanks that provide gas into our system which, of course, is used to heat homes.&nbsp; And as employees from various divisions gather together to come up with a solution, the values of quality and teamwork were very evident. Each member of the team that night came in during off hours, bringing specific skills to collaborate on a solution that, ultimately, ended with three people climbing to the top of the 80 foot tank in the coldest hour of the coldest day to implement a fix.&nbsp; It was all hands on deck and, in fact, a temporary worker was brought into the conversation because he had an idea for fixing the broken valve based on an observation earlier in the day.&nbsp; This truly demonstrated the value of teamwork and illustrates the great lengths our employees went to in order to ensure customers had gas to heat their homes.</p> <p>Traci Dossett, Chief Operating Officer at SEP, a software engineering firm, also discussed the direct connection she has been able to make between her personal values and the organization’s—a value of service that has been apparent from the moment SEP was founded. </p> <p>“When we developed our mission and vision statements at SEP, we committed to making the world a better place.&nbsp; I know it sounds hokey, but we really took it to heart.&nbsp; This means making our clients better, making each other better, making life better for our families, making the technical field better and, finally, making our community better.&nbsp; We live these values out every day through our client training sessions, mentoring, wellness initiatives, technical community involvement and events, and our community involvement plan.&nbsp; </p> <p>A concrete example is our Pay It Forward Month. We provide a small stipend for each employee and ask them to help others in the community in some small, but meaningful way. Involvement in our community has become ingrained in who we are.&nbsp; I see our people taking it to heart and going above and beyond.”</p> <p>Leaders left the session energized about their personal leadership, and eager to help others explore their own personal values and help them make the link to their organizational values. Lisa Wissman of Community Health put it this way: </p> <p>“The workshop was valuable for me in multiple ways. I have applied what I learned, shared examples from the panel and networked with two new individuals who are assisting me with helping a young engineer build a professional network for his job search. I truly hit the jackpot!&nbsp; Thank you for creating the opportunity.” </p> <p>This most recent Values-Driven Leadership Workshop again confirmed the importance of the contribution that HCLA makes to the community by helping leaders further their development. Hearing stories from panel members, having the space and time to reflect on their own values, and getting an unexpected opportunity to reflect on their leadership philosophies, HCLA participants and alumnae are in an even better position to make a positive impact on the communities in which they live and work.&nbsp; </p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <strong><span>Jill Doyle</span></strong><span> is the Executive Director of the Hamilton County Leadership Academy.&nbsp; She has spent her entire career in the leadership development and non-profit management field.&nbsp; Her passion for lifelong learning and community engagement led her to HCLA four years ago. <strong>Renee Harness,</strong> Certified Master and principal at Harness Leadership, is also the author of support tools and a long-time contributor to The Leadership Challenge. She can be reached at 317-489-3335.&nbsp; Together, they partnered to develop and facilitate this half-day Values Driven Leadership Workshop for community leaders.<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></span>

It is a cause. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>For all of us at International Leadership Associates (ILA), we feel privileged to have been involved from the beginning in this important cause—to bring the power of The Leadership Challenge® to dedicated leaders of various nonprofit organizations in the Greater Cincinnati area. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>Our 2014 Gift of Leadership program was held in March, and for two full days ILA and our other collaborative partners hosted a dynamic group of managers and directors from such Greater Cincinnati area nonprofits as The Council on Aging, Girl Scouts, St. Vincent de Paul, and the Cincinnati Youth Collaborative, among others. The venue was once again provided by our partner, Camp Joy, a nonprofit organization devoted to experiential learning for over 75 years. Another partner in this year’s program was The Leadership Council of Human Services Executives, whose mission is to maximize the impact of nonprofit organizations, develop their leaders and strengthen the community. They generously provided scholarships for the program, and are deeply committed to providing more nonprofit members with ongoing, high</span><span>-</span><span>quality leadership development opportunities, such as The Leadership Challenge.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>Collectively, we have been working on a vision of making the Cincinnati community better by building up our nonprofit leadership. We have developed a plan and are already in the process of rolling out a strategy to seek ongoing funding from businesses and other donors, to make the gift of The Leadership Challenge the foundation of leadership for area nonprofits.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span>Certified Master Facilitator Valarie Willis is also part of this endeavor. She offers The Leadership Challenge for additional members of this nonprofit community, and has played an important role in developing the strategy for keeping the Gift of Leadership moving forward in Cincinnati.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span><img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/whiteboard.png" class="image_Float_Left" style="width: 250px; height: 185px;">In addition to The Leadership Challenge® Workshop—which included the Leadership Practices Inventory—this year’s program, again, offered a variety of outside experiential learning activities, including a high ropes challenge course designed to bring forth many of the lessons of The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. There were community-building campfires and “rustically elegant” cabin</span><span>-</span><span>style sleeping accommodations. New friendships were made and participants have begun sharing best practices—already raising their leadership capacity to better serve people in need throughout the Greater Cincinnati community. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span><br> <br> For participants at this year’s event, it was a remarkable experience. As one 2014 Gift of Leadership participant wrote: &nbsp;</span></p> <p> </p> <p><em><span>“Thank you for the opportunity to attend The Leadership Challenge and for taking the time to provide feedback on the assessment. It was unlike any other “workshop” that I have</span></em><span> attended </span><em><span>and has affected me both personally and professionally. I have made some commitments</span></em> <em><span>to myself that I intend to accomplish in the next 30 days that will benefit me and</span></em> <em><span>the organization. I have a partner/new friend that I will be meeting in 30 days to hold me</span></em> <em><span>accountable. Thanks again for thinking of me for this opportunity.”</span></em> </p> <p> </p> <p><span>Every day, people working with human services agencies must confront circumstances which seem virtually impossible, and often deeply heart wrenching.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p><strong><em>Q:&nbsp; Most good leaders seem to be good storytellers. Can you share your thoughts on why that is and some examples that illustrate the value of telling stories?</em></strong></p> <p><strong>A: &nbsp;</strong>Stories are a powerful tool for teaching people about what’s important and what’s not, what works and what doesn’t, what is and what could be. Through stories, leaders pass on lessons about shared values and the norms about how people should work together.</p> <p>In a business climate obsessed with PowerPoint presentations, complex graphs and charts, and lengthy reports, storytelling may seem to some like a soft way of getting hard stuff done. It’s anything but that. Research shows that telling more positive stories than negative stories enables individuals, groups, and organizations to recover more quickly from adversity and trauma.&nbsp; In fact, research indicates that when leaders want to communicate standards, stories are a much more effective means of communication than are corporate policy statements, data about performance, and even a story <em>plus</em> the data. </p> <p>For example, consider Phillip Kane’s experience. His dad was a great storyteller, and he used stories especially effectively to teach lessons. Phillip has carried the family tradition into his business life at Goodyear.</p> <p>When Phillip was named to head up a large team with previously poor engagement scores for communication, he needed to find a way to be more proactive about connecting with employees. So he began writing to the team every Friday, telling them stories in “The Week,” essentially a newsletter in the form of stories with life lessons in them. He carried the practice with him when he was appointed president of Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, a 2,500-person wholly owned subsidiary of Goodyear.</p> <p>Storytelling, Phillip says, accomplishes two things. It offers a framework for relating to the message—something that people encounter in their own lives that can bridge to the main point. It also offers him the chance to lead through an example rather than to come across simply as preaching.</p> <p>Telling stories forces you to pay close attention to what your constituents are doing. Peers generally make better role models for what to do at work than famous people or ones several levels up in the hierarchy. When others hear or read a story about someone with whom they can identify, they are much more likely to see themselves doing the same thing. People seldom tire of hearing stories about themselves and the people they know. These stories get repeated, and the lessons of the stories get spread far and wide. </p> <p>Storytelling is how people pass along lessons from generation to generation, culture to culture. Stories aren’t meant to be secret; they’re meant to be told.</p> <p><strong>Jim Kouzes</strong> is the Dean’s Executive Fellow of Leadership, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Using a proven, evidence-based approach to leadership—in the form of The Leadership Challenge—Presence Health is inspiring its nursing leaders to strengthen partnerships, value contributions, and create innovative solutions that are transforming the culture of the entire organization. </p> <p>As the largest Catholic health system in Illinois, Presence Health’s 150 locations state-wide include 12 hospitals and 27 long-term care and senior living facilities. What began in 2011 with the merger of two single ministries, Provena Health and Resurrection Health Care, is now a fully integrated health system consisting of five congregations:</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Franciscan Sisters of Sacred Heart</li> 
                <li>Servants of the Holy Heart of Mary</li> 
                <li>Sisters of the Holy Family Nazareth</li> 
                <li>Sisters of Mercy of the Americas</li> 
                <li>Sisters of the Resurrection</li> 
               </ul> <p>Collectively, these congregations represent a unified passion, capturing the essence of the Presence Health name: to be <em>present</em> with others. And it was through this desire for unified connection that Presence Saint Joseph Medical Center wanted to ignite change within its nursing staff. </p> <p>Presence Saint Joseph had a historical baseline turnover of 34.8% among its staff of RNs within their first year. While better than &nbsp;the national average of 49.0% (as of 2013), VP of Patient Care Services and Chief Nursing Executive Officer Jackie Medland, RN, PhD, sought to Challenge the Process to improve the organization’s turnover rate and&nbsp; create a sustainable development program that would help engage each nurse as a leader. </p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>To achieve this, Jackie began working with her team to create a new leadership initiative: <strong>Every Nurse a Leader</strong>, a program that<strong> </strong>would<strong> </strong>establish a new philosophy and mindset for emerging nurse leaders at the point of care and fundamentally transform the culture long-term. &nbsp;They started by looking for the root cause of the high turnover rate among RNs. What they found was a lack of structure—a framework that could provide guidance for new graduate nurses and help them understand more clearly what it would take to be successful in their work.&nbsp; Jackie’s goal was to provide that kind of guidance and also promote an environment of affirmation. To do that, she and her team turned to The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® —a living model for exemplary leadership in the nursing staff.</p> <p>By helping new nursing leaders live each of The Five Practices through their daily work, Jackie and her team sought to create a culture where “everyday leaders” would become the new standard. &nbsp;One important goal also was to reinforce Presence Saint Joseph’s mantra, Today Counts, the organization’s value-based message that seeks to empower everyone to make a difference. To deepen the practice of that value, they designed components into the program that would cultivate interdisciplinary partnerships by nurturing nurse/physician collaboration. They also emphasized developing inter-organizational relationships and holistic teams to focus on the common mission of patient care.</p> <p>At the heart of the <strong>Every Nurse a Leader</strong> program is a two-year Transition into Practice residency, set up in stages to allow everyone to grow and become a leader within the organization. Focusing on clinical, technical, interpersonal, and leadership skills, each participant is involved in a series of projects and roles throughout their residency. To build self-awareness, all nurse participants complete The Leadership Practices Inventory 360® (LPI 360), based on The Five Practices model. The first LPI 360 is administered during their orientation period, after their cohort begins. &nbsp;A follow-up assessment is completed at the end of the first year of practice and, again, at the end of the second year—and beyond.</p> <p>Residents in the program Model the Way with hands-on clinical training in a Simulation Lab where they receive real-time feedback on their clinical and critical thinking skills as well as a full debrief to help analyze and reflect on their performance. Taking the challenge one step further, each cohort spends a full day at an outdoor teamwork facility where they learn how to take risks, to overcome fears, and to trust each other as they work as a unified team.</p> <p>Jackie and her team at Presence Saint Joseph have found that Enabling Others to Act through these collaborations creates a supportive infrastructure that encourages key stakeholders to make a meaningful investment in the process and strengthens engagement and shared decision-making. More experienced Nurse Managers actively participate in interviewing, onboarding, and providing transitional support during the residency period for new RNs. In addition, interdisciplinary partners, including the nursing leadership team and executives, are involved in the Transition into Practice Program through cohort educational sessions. &nbsp;As a result of this shared investment,&nbsp; quality decisions are aligned more closely with the values of the organization, and decision making is &nbsp;more timely and efficient. Presence Saint Joseph has seen an increased commitment to goals and those involved in the program have also reported an increased capacity to attain goals.</p> <p><strong>Every Nurse a Leader</strong> has already produced stellar results through six program cohorts. Presence Saint Joseph has decreased its turnover rate for RNs in their first year: down to 9.6% (a 70% drop from a historical rate of 34.8%). And although the program currently accounts for only about 12% of the overall Presence Saint Joseph nursing staff, it has reduced the organizational costs associated with overall RN turnover—current annual cost savings are estimated between $435,000 and $775,000.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>The <strong>Every Nurse a Leader </strong>program at Presence Saint Joseph Medical Center continues to grow and reach more and more aspiring leaders within the organization. We, at Integris Performance Advisors, are proud to have played a part in their success. We congratulate Jackie Medland and her team for leading the charge and showing so clearly what it truly means to liberate the leader within.</p> <p><strong>KJ Jenison</strong> is Leadership Advisor with <a href="http://www.integrispa.com/">Integris Performance Advisors</a>—Platinum Sponsor of The Leadership Challenge Forum 2014—and a Certified Master-In-Training of The Leadership Challenge.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Honesty with yourself and others produces a level of humility that earns you credibility. People don’t respect know-it-alls, especially when they know that the know-it-all doesn’t know it all. People like people who show they are human. Admitting mistakes and being open to accepting new ideas and new learning communicates that you are willing to grow. It does something else as well. It promotes a culture of honesty and openness. That’s healthy for you and for others. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Hubris is the killer disease in leadership. It’s fun to be a leader, gratifying to have influence, and exhilarating to have scores of people cheering your every word. In many all-too-subtle ways, it’s easy to be seduced by power and importance. All evil leaders have been infected with the disease of hubris, becoming bloated with an exaggerated sense of self and pursuing their own sinister ends. How then to avoid it?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Humility is the way to resolve the conflicts and contradictions of leadership. You can avoid excessive pride only if you recognize that you’re human and need the help of others, and that’s another important reason for leaders being great learners. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Excerpted from the <em>Leadership Practices Inventory Planner, 4<sup>th</sup> edition</em>, James M.

The coach might be someone from inside or outside of the organization. This person might be a peer, a manager, a trainer, or someone with specific expertise in what you are trying to learn. Coaches can play a number of roles. The most obvious is to watch you perform, give you feedback, and offer suggestions for improvement.

When you return to work after training, your initial enthusiasm can be quickly crushed if there is no one around to offer words of encouragement.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Many organizations have an honest desire to develop more and better leaders. Yet despite the noblest of intentions many, if not most, also fall short. While some individuals may show improvement, the collective effort either never takes hold or fizzles out after a relatively short time. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In our work at International Leadership Associates (ILA), we’ve come to identify four common flaws that most frequently derail these leadership development efforts. Although none will come as a complete surprise to many of our colleagues in the field, there are some key lessons we’ve learned. And as you read along, consider from your experience what the biggest culprits you have found that get in the way of leaders developing to their full potential. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Let’s begin with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fatal Flaw #1</span>:<span>&nbsp; </span>Managers, from senior level on down, simply fail to tell their people they expect them to lead. Few managers look each of their people directly in the eye and tell them, “I expect you to be a leader in this organization. It is a fundamental part of your job, which must be done well”. Instead, managers walk their people through annual performance metrics, usually stressing financial or quantifiable results—a component that can determine as much as 70% of an individual’s pay. There are typically a few other categories, e.g., self-development or community involvement, and then something about living the organization’s values (assuming there are some). Finally, there may be an add-on category about leadership development, frequently embedded somewhere in the self-development objectives. This, unfortunately, is how too many managers rationalize that they are, in fact, clarifying their expectations around leadership. But the communicated message is clear: make your numbers and, in your spare time, continue to improve yourself and work on becoming a better leader. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Compare that messaging from the ineffective manager with the leader who tells her people, “I expect you to deliver on the results we have agreed to, and I expect you to be a great leader for others throughout the entire organization.<span>&nbsp; </span>It doesn’t matter how good your numbers are, by themselves. If you’re not providing the leadership this company needs you to provide, your pay and your opportunities for advancement will be severely limited. It’s that important!”</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Everything is a high priority these days. And everyone is expected to meet ever-growing expectations. As a result, it’s more important than ever to be very clear about how important leadership is. Otherwise, those development efforts will inevitably slip between the cracks. So the question for leaders is this: Does everyone on your team view stepping forward as a leader a “must do”, or do they think it’s an option? </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fatal Flaw #2</span> is a bit seductive—giving the appearance that it’s been tended to when, in fact, it hasn’t. Assuming the expectation to lead is clearly made, there is a great deal of confusion about what it actually means. For those individuals who <em>do</em> become inspired and committed to improving their leadership, too often they discover they’re not quite sure what they are supposed to do, how they will know they are leading in the way the company desires. The reason? Because many organizations have not adopted a clear, concise, definable, model of leadership.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite what some organizational leaders seem to believe—that leadership is an esoteric, philosophical list of academic concepts—a well-grounded leadership model allows everyone, in any position throughout the organization, to know exactly what leadership looks like, what people do when they are leading, and how it differs from other activities. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Almost all companies with whom I’ve worked have developed a competency model, describing capabilities managers at various levels are expected to demonstrate in order to be deemed ‘effective’. While some competencies are more directly tied to leadership than others, they generally cover broad knowledge areas such as financial acumen, strategic agility, business savvy, and communications. But having a competency model in place is just a starting point. For example, being competent at people development and having a cross-boundary mindset will no doubt be tremendous assets to rising leaders. However, those descriptors fail to explain what the leader must be doing on a day-to-day basis to fully develop these competencies. And for all of us at ILA, that’s where The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® model has helped to take our clients to the next level of leadership development. With its evidenced-based research and its immediate, hands-on applicability, the model is like an instruction manual for creating higher performing teams, increasing employee engagement, and inspiring people to do their very best work – all key outcomes of leadership. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fatal Flaw #3</span> is a lack of context—context that establishes the importance for leadership, explaining why it’s a crucial expectation. Unfortunately, context is often assumed to be known by everyone in the organization when it’s not. And with constantly changing circumstances, it must be reinforced time and time again.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One ILA client organization has done a remarkable job emphasizing the importance of leadership. Like many, they suffered financially during the 2008 downturn. But they weathered the storm and learned an invaluable lesson: in order for them to be a great company—especially in our constantly chaotic, unmanageable world—they would need to have great leaders in every department, at every level of the business. This meant developing leaders, regardless of title or position, who were willing and able to tackle tough problems, proactively respond to uncontrollable changes, and develop innovative solutions or breakthroughs ideas. They now view leadership development as a key strategy that will help ensure continued prosperity and future success. And as a result, when people hear that they are expected to be leaders, they understand why it’s so important and why the company is making such an effort to develop more leaders. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Without an established context, you’ll likely hear people refer to leadership development efforts as “the flavor of the day,” or just another self-promoting initiative from someone at the top. If that’s the case, I encourage you to continue to help your aspiring leaders communicate effectively the context of leadership, to help their people understand the business problem that leadership development is addressing and why it is a necessity for the organization going forward.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fatal Flaw #4</span> - the last of the culprits impeding leadership development efforts is the most obvious—and the one receiving the most attention. It is the lack of ongoing follow-through. To ensure that people grow and develop as effective leaders, there must be an intentional, purposeful, and sustained effort that is a key organizational strategy. It has to be more than an annual self-development objective to read a book or attend a workshop on the subject. It has to be something for which people are held accountable every single day.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Many organizations have invested heavily in systems and processes designed to keep people constantly focused on financial or project performance objectives. Formal meetings or casual drop-ins throughout the day focus on project status and problems, new opportunities to increase sales, or innovative steps to overcome obstacles. Plenty of reports also help keep key performance indicators and goals on everyone’s radar.<span>&nbsp; </span>In retail organizations, the first morning email for many managers is a spreadsheet featuring the previous day’s results and comps for the same period a year ago. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The good news is that when it comes to financial or project performance, people don’t need to tie a string around their finger to remember to do this kind of work. It’s embedded in their DNA. But can the same be said about the focus on leadership? For example, the movement of prospects and opportunities through what some sales-driven companies call the “sales funnel” is a topic of daily conversation. Yet, the movement of up and coming leaders (or other key talent) through the development funnel might be discussed once or twice a year.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Many of the best performers with whom I’ve worked still have to remind themselves to lead, because those behaviors have not yet become unconscious habits. So in much the same way organizations keep everyone mindful of the importance of financial and operational essentials, it is equally important to help everyone remain mindful of some of the most important aspects of leadership. In order that strategic leadership development efforts take hold, organizations must be thoughtful and intentional about the systems and support mechanisms needed to reinforce its value. Of course, individuals are still responsible for continuing to learn and practice more effective leadership behaviors. But organizational support is essential. Setting clear expectations about leadership, clearly defining it, establishing context, and providing ongoing support are the fundamentals for a successful organization-wide leadership development process. </p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Steve Coats</strong>, a Leadership Challenge® Workshop Certified Master, is a managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a leadership development education and consulting firm.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>“I am sorry, Justin. What is this <em>leadership</em>?”<em><span>&nbsp; </span></em>This was the unexpected reply I received when I asked Urbano Chavez, a long-time friend and Cabecar Indian, how his indigenous group might describe exemplary leadership.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>It was the 27<sup>th</sup> of December 2010 and we were camped under the corrugated roof of a derelict house in the tiny village of Paso Marcos, in the Cartago Province of Costa Rica. Cartago lies in the Central Eastern belt of the country, running from the central mountainous spine toward the Caribbean and the Province of Limon. At the time, I was halfway through a foot and kayak crossing of the country, from the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea - a journey I’d devised during my three previous expeditions as I searched for different perspectives from which to understand this country I had grown to love. For this adventure, I had put together a team of four people including Urbano and myself, Martin Veregas, a local farmer, and Henrietta Stavely from England. At this time, our team had trekked 104 kilometres through rain and cloud forest, crossing the Talamanca mountains at an altitude of 3,300 metres whilst often staying in Cabecar settlements and hunting camps along the way.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>As the rain beat a thunderous rhythm, I explored with Urbano the values and concepts at the core of the Cabecar, a population of around 20,000 whose culture has remained little changed for 1500 years. Despite knowing Urbano for a decade, I had made assumptions about Cabecar leadership that my friend quickly dispelled. He explained that there was no word for leadership in the Cabecar language, and no word for love either. The word used for both was ‘<em>respect</em>’. This described the relationship between <em>Caciques</em> (chiefs) and their communities, husbands and wives, as well as parents and children alike. The more we chatted, it became clear that there was little, if any, conceptual understanding of leadership and I became even more intrigued. Every spare moment for the rest of the trip Urbano and I discussed the values and structure of the Cabecar. By the end of our journey, I had already arranged to return and live with Urbano’s Jameikari community in order to conduct field research.</p> <p>Just eight months later, I was met by Urbano and his wife, Jami, at the edge of the Nawari reserve near Siquirres in Cartago Province—an indigenous reserve that contains<span>&nbsp; </span>thousands of hectares of primary rain and cloud forest, and runs westward from the Pacuare Valley all the way to the Talamanca mountains. Some of the settlements that lie within the reserve are four day’s hard<span>&nbsp; </span>walking from any vehicle accessible track, so any<span>&nbsp; </span>movement is restricted to foot, with mule or horse support. Loading my gear onto the horse Urbano and Jami had brought, we were soon striding through the rainforest on the way to the area of the Pacuare Valley in which the Jameikari community live.<span>&nbsp; </span>We stopped off to greet Doña Silvia, the community <em>Caciqua</em> (chief) and also Urbano’s mother, before climbing up the final hill to Urbano’s home. Soon we were sitting by his palenque<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>, discussing the days ahead that were to include my real first-hand introduction to important aspects of Cabecar traditions.</p> <p>The next day passed quickly as I attended a community gathering before packing the few things I was allowed to take with me for my tribal initiation. In order to understand the fabric of the Cabecar culture, I had asked to experience elements of the initiation that teenage boys complete for a month at a time as part of their transition to manhood. This tradition centres on living in the forest, within clearly defined rules, whilst being guided by a mentor. Urbano would be my mentor for my truncated initiation. He explained that we could bring knives, machetes, a bowl, cups and spoons, along with<span>&nbsp; </span>head torches, candles, matches, and fishing hooks and line. The only food we could bring was coffee and bananas and I must leave all modern conveniences and pleasures behind, even books. In fact, I had to be given express permission to bring a mosquito net as I had contracted malaria on a previous trip.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>Leaving Urbano’s home the next morning, we hiked to the area of my initiation, occasionally cutting our way through fresh growth and deadfall. Urbano showed me places special to his father and the Jameikari and began to explain the traditions, beliefs and structures that have supported the Cabecar over the centuries. It was during this walk that he introduced me to the core values of <em>Madre Tierra, fuego, agua y ninos </em>(Mother Earth, fire, water, and children). And later on, whenever I asked any Cabecar about the <em>valores </em>of the Cabecar, everyone gave me the same answer, whether child or elder.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>After a couple of hours we arrived in a small clearing by a swampy creek and immediately began to<span>&nbsp; </span>build our palm frond thatched shelter, before collecting palm hearts, and starting the fire; This would be home for the next three days.</p> <p><span><img alt="" style="width: 300px; height: 201px;" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/photo%20insert%201.JPG"></span></p> <p>During this time, I was taught to hunt and fish, and to identify edible and medicinal plants and fruits--important technical skills but seen as secondary to understanding the relationship of self and the Cabecar to the forest.<span>&nbsp; </span>The most essential lessons I learned after each day’s hard hiking around the area when Urbano would teach me about the belief system and narratives that support his people’s view of the world. Through the blackness of night, we sang Cabecar songs to the forest around us and I was strongly encouraged to reflect upon my identity, my relationship with the forest and the ecological web that wound through it and what that relationship might be in the future. Although highly rational and non-spiritual by nature, I found the process deeply affecting and effective in bringing clarity around my motives and values.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>Despite minimal equipment and reliance on the forest for food, our time passed too quickly and soon we were singing the <em>Cerabo </em>(armadillo) song as we walked back toward the part of the valley in which Urbano’s palenque stood. While my mentoring during this brief initiation may have been informal and unstructured, I reached a profound understanding that I believe other forms of inquiry could not have delivered. In fact, just before walking into Urbano’s home clearing, he said, “Justin, you are different now<em>.”<span>&nbsp; </span></em>And I was. </p> <p>The next day, Doña Silvia hosted a large fiesta to celebrate my visit to the Jameikari community and to welcome me to her clan. It was a gentle but lively affair with dustbins full of fermented banana or maize alcohol, called <em>chicha</em>, being consumed. Finally, after some very ragged dancing and singing, virtually every man was asleep around the fire in the large palenque.<span>&nbsp; </span>Slowly, I walked up the hill by starlight and began the sense-making process by stroking the jaguar tooth I had been presented by Diego, Urbano’s youngest brother to mark my passage into his tribe</p> <p>The next morning I began my interviews with members of the Jameikari and two neighbouring communities. I began with Doña Silvia who explained that her principle role as Caciqua was to ensure the Cabecar were sustainable by helping them adapt to meet the needs of future generations. </p> <p><span><img alt="" style="width: 300px; height: 201px;" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/photo%20insert2_Dona%20Silvia%20-%20Caciqua.JPG"></span></p> <p>Promoting the Cabecar language was essential to the tribe’s survival and teaching the language in primary school for the last eight years had made a significant contribution. Doña Silvia explained that if the Cabecar remained connected with their culture, they would be in a better position to make strategic decisions beneficial to their tribe in a future Costa Rica. By way of example, she shared the story of the Cabecar of the Peje Valley. When considering whether to accept a government offer to provide electricity within their reserve, the community asked the children and young adults to make the decision as they would be the ones who would be living with the consequences. In the end, they asked for a pylon line to be run to the school but no further, explaining that if they were to treat this resource as <em>infinite</em> then they might treat their environment and its resources in the same way, leading to erosion in the natural web of which they are part. This sense of sustainability and clarity of understanding remains an exceptional example of <em>Inspiring a Shared Vision </em>in practice.</p> <p>The Cabecar vision is informed by their values and the more I spoke with members of the community, the more compelling these values became. <strong>Mother Earth</strong>, for example, represents the environment in which the Cabecar operate and the requirement for sustainability. <strong>Fire</strong> is both security and comfort, while <strong>Water</strong> is the element that connects all communities and the ecosystem of which they are part. <strong>Children</strong> are central to all aspects of Cabecar life, making succession planning of paramount importance.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>Every Cabecar I met intuitively <em>Modelled the Way</em>, a discipline that has been shaped by the forest as much as by the tribe itself. And I found a concentrated effort in each community to develop every person within it through individual and group coaching and by encouraging learning through a sense of exploration, adventure, and experimentation—fully embracing<em> Challenging the Process, Enabling Others to Act,</em> and <em>Encouraging the Heart</em>. </p> <p>After three weeks of being enveloped in the spirit and warmth of the Cabecar people, it became very clear to me that The <em>Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® </em>are central to their culture. Indeed, the consistent understanding of the community’s vision and values has been achieved over centuries without the benefit of a written language but, rather, through traditions of storytelling and intuitive coaching. For the Cabecar people, there is no need for the use of terms such as leadership or followership as these behaviours are the responsibility of all Cabecar, not just their Caciques. As Doña Silvia’s daughter, Ruby, explained when asked what the Cabecar look for in their leaders, </p> <p>“They (caciques) provide care and demonstrate how respect should be shown. Not just within, and between the communities and clans but also to other indigenous (people), Ticos<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>, Siboh<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a> and the environment. Leaders teach and show but do not dictate.<span>&nbsp; </span>They create frameworks for learning through experimentation. They encourage children and adults alike to make their own decisions and understand the nature of responsibility but they are always there as the final safety (net) and to dispense wisdom when asked.”</p> <p>There are no Cabecar words for leadership or love. And there’s a very good reason for that, as these concepts are wholly bound in the collaborative and adaptive precepts that serve as the very foundation of Cabecarship.</p> <p><strong>Justin Featherstone</strong> MC, FRGS, delivers leadership development programmes, leads expeditions to the mountains, rainforests and whitewater rivers of the world and is an occasional academic lecturer, documentary presenter, and public speaker.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>One of the reasons the best leaders are highly self-aware is that they ask for feedback from others. In fact, the best leaders ask for feedback not only about what they’re doing well, but about what they’re <em>not</em> doing well. They want to know the negative as well as the positive. But that also explains why being able to manage your emotions is so important. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Who in their right mind is going to give negative feedback knowing that you’re going to get angry? But if people know you genuinely want the feedback, that you’ll thank them for it, and that you’ll do something with the feedback they give you, then you’ll benefit, and so will they. The more specific you can be with your request, the more likely that others will have something to share with you.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When people are learning, others tend to be very forgiving. So tell your constituents what you’re trying to do and that you want their honest feedback. Afterward, ask, “How’d I do?” Have a conversation. Then say thanks.</p>

In addition, we also incorporated other leadership development tools and strategy components, including personality typing using the MBTI® assessment and conflict resolution communications skills training.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At the 10-month mark, positive results were achieved in each of The Five Practices—between 10 to 20 percent! Elevated leadership levels have been documented within the entire group, which has inspired them to begin working toward a complete leadership culture change. In addition to continuing to develop current and future leaders, the group is now using The Leadership Challenge with individual contributors. The goal is to begin to develop a common leadership language that will, ultimately, create a better communication bridge between leaders and their teams. And because frontline employees know and understand The Leadership Challenge, at least at a basic level, leaders will be able to make an even bigger impact.&nbsp; Plus, these individual contributors are learning how they, too, can develop their own leadership thumbprint.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The remarkable results this company’s Technology Group realized are a tribute to participants’ hard work and perseverance, using The Leadership Challenge and the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI) as primary development tools.&nbsp; </p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>Craig Haptonstall</strong> is president and CEO of Leadership Mechanics LLC and a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge® Workshop.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>The horrific terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 may have occurred 12 years ago, but the memory of those events remain emblazoned on our minds and hearts to this day.<span>&nbsp; </span>And no organization embodies the mission of honoring those who were affected more than the September 11th Families’ Association and its work with the 9/11 Tribute Center. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The September 11th Families’ Association is managed by a group of dedicated professionals located in the shadow of the World Trade Center, and supported by hundreds of volunteers who were personally affected by the events of that day—family members who lost loved ones, survivors, uniformed services (e.g., FDNY, NYPD, PAPD), and residents of Lower Manhattan. Welcoming over 500,000 visitors annually, these dedicated volunteers contribute hundreds of hours of their time and their deepest emotions to fulfill the mission of the organization: </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>To support victims of terrorism through communication, representation and peer support… to unite the September 11th community, present evolving issues, and share resources for long-term recovery.<span>&nbsp; </span></em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Just this year, on October 21st, members of the Loeb Consulting Group were honored to have an opportunity to dedicate our time and resources to lead their management team through a customized half-day introduction to The Leadership Challenge and experience, first-hand, the spirit and passion of this group of dedicated professionals. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our own life-changing experience began when Natalie Loeb, Founder of Loeb Consulting Group, was touring the 9/11 Tribute Center offices for the first time with Lee Ielpi, President and Co-Founder of the September 11th Families Association.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lee, who lost his son, a firefighter, on September 11, was showing Natalie a tray of semi-precious stones that he had personally polished and brought into the offices so that each employee could select one for his/her own.<span>&nbsp; </span>As they discussed the courage and dedication it requires for the team to come to work and contribute with enthusiasm each and every day at this special place, Lee asked Natalie to choose one of the stones for herself.<span>&nbsp; </span>Honored and grateful, she chose a rough stone with a crack as a memento of her first visit. That crack made Natalie’s choice unique and memorable, and she carries it with her every day as a touchstone when she’s feeling stressed or anxious.<span>&nbsp; </span>It reminds her that life is not perfect; yet, at the same time, it is beautiful.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lee encouraged Natalie’s heart that day.<span>&nbsp; </span>He made the experience special with his gift. It was his way of saying “thank you” to Natalie for being there while offering her a handmade memento that would always remind her of this special place filled with courageous people dedicated to a common cause.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After that first visit and as we began planning our work with the group’s management team, a natural fit evolved. Rather than facilitate our Leadership Challenge program in its traditional order, we decided the cornerstone should revolve around the Practice that truly exemplified the association’s mission: Encourage the Heart.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Unlike many other organizations Loeb Consulting Group works with, the September 11th Families Association confronts challenges that are unique. Many of the volunteers the organization’s management group oversees have been dedicating their time, energy, and hearts to this effort for as long as eight years. And the emotions they confront almost daily are far more dramatic than what we would typically deal with in a more traditional for-profit or non-profit environment.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition to volunteers, the September 11th Families Association itself enjoys great stability among its employees with an average tenure of five years. As a result, in many ways, Encouraging the Heart was an ideal complement to the association’s culture and mission. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>With COO Gordon Loeb as co-facilitator for this event, participants wasted no time in sharing personal stories of those who had significantly influenced their careers and lives. It was quite apparent that the lessons passed on from others helped shape their lives in ways that created a natural fit in how each of them contributed to fulfilling the organization’s mission. For example, the awareness of how their daily interactions impact others, in some cases for years to come, was immediately realized.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>While we introduced The Leadership Challenge program with Encourage the Heart, we seamlessly moved through each of the other Five Practices: Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, and Enable Others to Act. As the program progressed and participants explored how to live out the Practices, they consistently, either obviously or subtly, referred back to the essential principles of Encourage the Heart. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We also employed the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI) with the group and, true to form, they quite naturally received feedback in the appropriate spirit—as a gift. Without defensiveness, there was an openness to address the feedback they were given and a real commitment to leverage their strengths in order to improve their effectiveness as leaders and to help develop the leadership capacity of their volunteers as well. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As is always the case, the power of The Leadership Challenge to help the September 11th Families Association increase its capacity to serve is just beginning. The work and dedication of the group’s leadership team and its volunteers have encouraged OUR hearts and Loeb Consulting Group is honored to be able to continue to donate our time and resources as we work with the association to follow through on its commitments.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>People who practice more often are more likely to become experts at what they do.</p> <p>To be the best you can be, you must not only apply what you learn on the playing field, but you must also hone your skills on the practice field. We know this is true in the performing arts and in sports, but somehow people do not always apply the same idea to leadership. <span>&nbsp;</span>Professional leaders take practice seriously. The practice may be role playing a negotiation, rehearsing a speech, or a one-on-one dialogue with a coach. Whatever it is, practice is essential to learning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Practice fields also offer the opportunity to try out unfamiliar methods, behaviors, and tools in a safer environment than on-the-job situations. You are more likely to take risks when you feel safe than when you feel highly vulnerable. Since the stakes are higher on the job than on the practice field, give yourself the chance to run some plays in practice before rushing into the game.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>You can also treat every experience as a learning experience, even when it’s for real.</p> <p>Whether you consider the experience a raving success or a miserable failure, step back and ask yourself and those involved, “What went well? What went poorly?” “What did I do well? What did I do poorly?” “What could we improve?” The best leaders are the best learners, and learning can occur anytime, anywhere. Take advantage of that fact. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Excerpted from the <em>Leadership Practices Inventory Planner, 4<sup>th</sup> edition</em>, James M. Kouzes and Barry Z.

How does dialogue Inspire a Shared Vision and Enable Others to Act?</span></strong></span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A: &nbsp;</span>Leadership is a relationship, and strong relationships are built on mutual understanding. You can get to that <em>mutual</em> understanding only through conversation and dialogue. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This means that you can’t adopt the view that visions come from the top down. You have to start engaging others in a collective dialogue about the future, not delivering a monologue. You can’t mobilize people to willingly travel to places they don’t want to go. No matter how grand the dream of an individual visionary, if others don’t see in it the possibility of realizing their hopes and desires, they won’t follow voluntarily or wholeheartedly.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To become an exemplary leader, you must develop a deep appreciation of the collective hopes, dreams, and aspirations of your constituents. Constituents come to believe in their leaders—to see them as worthy of their trust—when they believe that the leaders have the constituents’ best interests at heart. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Leaders who are clearly interested only in their own agendas, their own advancement, and their own wellbeing will not be followed willingly. You have to reach out and attend to others, be present with them, and listen to them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This isn’t just theory. We know from our research that when leaders seek consensus around shared values, constituents are more positive. People who report that their managers engage in dialogue regarding common values feel a significantly stronger sense of personal effectiveness than individuals who feel that they’re wasting energy trying to figure out what they’re supposed to be doing.</p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong><span>Jim Kouzes,</span></strong><strong> </strong><span>cited by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Wall Street Journal</span> as one of the twelve best executive educators in the U.S., is the Dean’s Executive Fellow of Leadership, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>During the four years of my undergraduate studies, I worked on annual festivals of 10-minute plays written by students in the Introduction to Playwriting classes. The festival was the culmination of three months of writing, and the students were responsible for rewriting and revising their plays over the course of the week leading up to the festival. We had limited human resources, so everyone had multiple jobs: while students perfected their own scripts, they were also acting in, directing, and script managing the plays of their peers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everyone was forced to work for not only the success of the play they had written but the success of every other play that would be performed during the festival. The success of the festival as a whole became the shared vision of each group of students.</p> <p>I loved the energy of collaboratively creating with other artists to bring together one final product. Each year, the students left the class and the festival feeling bonded—and with a thirst to work in a collaborative context again.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The festival was a microcosm of what it is like working on a major theatre production. Working in theatre is all about the shared vision of the end result: the success of the play as a whole. In working on these 10-minute play festivals and other theatre projects, I learned a few things about what it looks like to Inspire a Shared Vision in the context of a community. <br> <br> </p> 
               <ol> 
                <li>No one works alone. Whether you are a lighting designer, an actor, a playwright, or a director, every member of the team experiences a moment of dread: I am not good enough. The costume I designed looks sloppy. That line of dialogue I wrote is awkward. I will make a mistake and then everyone will see what a failure I am. For me, this line of thinking inevitably led to pulling away from the community to hide inside my own wounded ego or fear of embarrassment. But a play is never about the contributions of one person, no matter how important they believe their role to be. Dramatic lighting is nothing without fabulous actors on a stage; a few good lines of dialogue are meaningless without a set designer creating a physical world for the characters to inhabit. In theatre, the talents of dozens of people come together to make an extraordinary product—a product that could never exist if it was the work of only one person.</li> 
                <li>Failure is not to be feared. The process of collaboration is vulnerable because not every idea that pops into your head is a good one. No matter how brilliant you are, you will present an idea in rehearsal that nobody likes or experiment with a line-delivery that falls utterly flat. But the stage during rehearsal is a safe place to try and fail. The point is to play. Bounce ideas off of other creative minds. Take your idea, explode it, and piece it back together from someone else’s perspective. When you can fail in a safe place, it becomes that much easier to come back from the failure, say “What did I learn?” and then take another risk. </li> 
                <li>There is no One Leader. &nbsp;It takes someone with vision to inspire a team of people to see the beautifully-finished piece instead of the unfinished moving pieces. A leader is able to put one person’s contributions in the context of the vision as a whole. But in rehearsals, there is never just one leader. Leadership crops up from different members at different times. The set designer who was feeling overwhelmed yesterday encourages the uninspired actor today. Everyone learns from each other’s creativity, mistakes, and energy. When the end result is in everyone’s best interest and no one is focused only on their own self-interest, everyone has the opportunity to be a leader. Each member of the team has the ability to breathe life back into the project for someone else. </li> 
               </ol> <p>The success or failure of any piece of theatre never falls on the shoulders of one artist. At the end of the festival every year, each writer, actor, director, and designer went up on stage and bowed together—because everyone was responsible for the finished product. Everyone had staked a claim in the outcome. Each student was committed to the success of every 10-minute play, whether he/she worked on it directly or not. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To me, Inspiring a Shared Vision implies community, one that breathes and grows to incorporate diverse voices. Working together, failing in a safe place, and leadership from multiple sources binds the community together so that everyone can take ownership of the piece as a whole. When the vision is shared, and everyone is committed to keeping the vision alive, no one person succeeds alone. No one person fails alone. And everyone leads each other.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Jordan Henry</strong> is a Client Care Specialist with Fine Points Professionals, <span>The Leadership Challenge®</span> Authorized Service Center.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>The quest for leadership is first an inner quest to discover who you are. Through self-development comes the confidence needed to lead. Self-confidence is really awareness of and faith in your own powers. These powers become clear and strong only as you work to identify and develop them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Learning to lead is about discovering what you care about and value. About what inspires you. About what challenges you. About what gives you power and competence. About what encourages you. When you discover these things about yourself, you’ll know what it takes to lead those qualities out of others.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Every leader has to learn the fundamentals and the discipline, and to a certain extent there’s some period during which you’re trying out a lot of new things. It’s a necessary stage in your development as a leader. The point is that you have to take what’s been acquired and reshape it into your own expression of yourself.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Sometimes liberation is as uncomfortable as intrusion, but in the end when you discover things for yourself you know that what’s inside is what you found there and what belongs there. It’s not something put inside you by someone else; it’s what you discover for yourself. </p>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp; I recently was listening to a broadcast interview on National Public Radio (NPR), <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/08/10/210686255/a-sense-of-power-can-do-a-number-on-your-brain?ft=1&amp;f=1007"><em><span>When Power Goes to Your Head, It May Shut out Your Heart</span></em></a>, featuring a discussion about new neuroscience research on the relationship of power with fame or promotion.&nbsp; Given that the connection between head and heart is such a fundamental principle in <em>The Leadership Challenge</em> and a key component of the Enable Others to Act practice, I’m wondering if you might weigh in on this discussion.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp; </p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Thanks so much for sharing news of this research on the relationship of power with fame and promotion. I found the NPR interview and the original article, <a href="http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/06/Hogeveen-Inzlicht-Obhi-in-press.pdf"><span>Power Changes How the Brain Responds to Others</span></a>, featured in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>, very intriguing. This latest research sheds light on why people in positions of authority can be less empathetic than others. I was also reminded that the more we learn about our brains, the more fascinating this field becomes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>My only caution is that having "power over someone" is not the only way to view power. There is other behavioral science research on power that looks at it from the perspective of "feeling powerful" or "feeling powerless." The type of power the NPR interviewee refers to is of the over/under, top/down variety.&nbsp; Other researchers—for example, the late professor of psychology at Harvard, David McClelland—equate feeling powerful with ability and competence. They use the phrase "socialized power" to differentiate it from the "personalized" or "self-serving power." Keep in mind that the root origin of the word "power" is "to be able." When people talk about "empowerment," for example, they are literally meaning, "to make others able." This is the perspective on power that we take in The Leadership Challenge.</p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p>In The Leadership Challenge, when we talk about how exemplary leaders make others feel powerful, we are in no way suggesting that leaders make others feel like they have "power over others" and should use it in self-serving ways. Rather, we are saying exemplary leaders use their own socialized power to make others feel strong and capable.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Thanks for stimulating the brain cells and getting us to think more deeply about words and their meaning…as well as about power!</p> <p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p> <p><strong>Jim Kouzes, </strong>cited by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Wall Street Journal</span> as one of the twelve best executive educators in the U.S., is the Dean’s Executive Fellow of Leadership, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>In addition to being a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge® and a member of the TLC community for many years, I have long been a supporter of our military, law enforcement, and emergency responders. As the granddaughter of a WWII Army paratrooper, daughter of a U.S. Air Force Captain, and the wife of a U.S. Marine and volunteer state trooper, part of my vision for life is to continue to find ways to honor and thank the men and women who are currently serving, or have previously served, our country and communities. And this past June I was privileged and blessed to have an opportunity to give back, introducing The Leadership Challenge® Workshop to a number of these courageous people. This eclectic group of men and women included Wounded Warriors injured in the line of duty, active duty Marines about to enter civilian life as well as veteran Marines who have already made the transition, and a gentleman who volunteers his weekends as a law enforcement officer for the Florida Highway Patrol. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Over two days, all of the participants eagerly embraced this opportunity to develop their personal and professional leadership capabilities as we explored The Leadership Challenge, including the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI) and experiential activities around The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. Individual LPI reports provided valuable feedback on current leadership behaviors and helped them uncover insights into the steps they could take to improve their effectiveness as leaders. It was personally fulfilling to watch as they realized how their past experiences could assist them in writing the next chapter of their leadership legacy. <span>&nbsp;</span>And the experience was equally powerful for everyone involved, as one participant said, “This has really helped me see how I can more effectively navigate the obstacles in my life and helped put me on a path to being a better leader in my home, workplace, and life.”</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Cooper_MastersGiveBack.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 188px;"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I was humbled and honored to be part of the leadership journey these brave men and women traveled. And as much as they benefited, I also came away with a deeper appreciation for the challenges they have encountered and, for many, continue to face.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>My introduction to the culture and spirit of Nigeria came just a year ago when I first met the engaging Oritseweyinmi Jemide. As my co-facilitator, Mary Cooper, and I were preparing for one of our annual Leadership Challenge ®Workshop and Facilitator Training events in Orlando, Florida, Weyinmi (his preferred name, pronounced Ware-Yin-Me) contacted me and expressed interest in attending.<span>&nbsp; </span>To help him prepare, we shipped a Facilitator Manual to Lagos (not an easy feat) so that he could complete the required pre-work before making his way to Central Florida and his first experience with The Leadership Challenge.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Other than a few email exchanges, I didn’t really know much about this smart, slender man who was traveling all this way to attend our workshop. Fortunately, several years ago, Mary and I adopted the practice of hosting a nightly dinner at a local restaurant as a way for us to get to know more about our workshop participants and adapt the subsequent two-day program based on what we learn. And during that first meeting, we learned much more about Weyinmi: his love of photography and his wonderful sense of humor that was augmented by a hearty laugh. He was already an accomplished trainer and business consultant and had a strong and evident value system that included a spiritual focus and orientation to family.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This pre-workshop dinner also proved important for a number of other reasons.<span>&nbsp; </span>As part of our group we not only had Weyinmi from Nigeria, but two other attendees from Singapore as well, which provided us with a unique opportunity to learn more about some of the cultural challenges involved in delivering The Leadership Challenge® Workshop around the world. And although I wasn’t aware of it at the time, this insight would come in handy a few months later as I headed to Nigeria to help Weyinmi bring The Leadership Challenge to Africa.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Having never been to Nigeria—or any country in Africa, for that matter—I was transformed by the experience. From the first, I was surprised to learn that Nigeria is the largest country in Africa (by population).<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, Nigeria has more than twice the population of the second largest African country, Ethiopia.<span>&nbsp; </span>And Lagos, the city where Weyinmi resides and we would deliver the workshop, has a population of over 7 million—roughly the size of New York City.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p dir="RTL"><span dir="LTR">&nbsp;</span></p> <p>On my first full day in Lagos, I was immediately transported into the Nigerian culture and Weyinmi’s world as pastor of the City of David, a congregation of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. I was graciously welcomed to what became a surprising and wonderful combination of education and celebration. In addition to it being Father’s Day, this was the one Sunday of the year that is dedicated to teaching and preaching on medical and health-related topics.<span>&nbsp; </span>For many Nigerians, church is where they go to learn (as well as to praise) and the City of David specifically provides members of its congregation with information they need to live a healthier lifestyle.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Other differences were also striking. In the U.S., for example, I’m used to a church service lasting about an hour. This service was three hours long, yet it never dragged.<span>&nbsp; </span>The music was phenomenal with a 15-person choir and a full band accompaniment.<span>&nbsp; </span>They sang and danced to one song that lasted over 25 minutes!<span>&nbsp; </span>I was completely enthralled by the dancing, the singing, and everyone in their Sunday best—complete with beautiful hair wraps of extraordinary color.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Fully experiencing the people of a different culture was an important reason why I was excited to make the trip to Nigeria. And this church experience—on my first full day, no less—offered the perfect opportunity to be welcomed into a different country by the hospitality of its people.<span>&nbsp; </span>From there, I was ready to get down to work with Weyinmi to finalize plans for the workshop and get ready to meet our group of aspiring leaders. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>From the experiential activities to the Leadership Practices Inventory coaching sessions, the first-ever The Leadership Challenge® Workshop held in Lagos, Nigeria was a terrific success—a testament to the global nature of Jim and Barry’s work. It is truly amazing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our 30 participants—bankers, teachers, and mid-level managers of community organizations—arrived very eager and willing to learn more about The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. They were especially interested in hearing about the issues leaders in the U.S. face, and to realize that the challenge of getting people engaged and motivated in the workplace is the same the world over, whether you’re in Nebraska or Nigeria.<span>&nbsp; </span>Despite any initial concern I might have had about whether the Personal Best activity would work or the stories we shared would make The Five Practices clearly evident, the workshop produced a wonderful two-day experience. During the presentation of certificates at the end of the second day, for example, each participant took time to briefly share with the group the impact the workshop had on them, including one leader who described it as “a deep, soul-searching, fulfilling, enriching, and rewarding time well spent.”<span>&nbsp; </span>And the recognition table was empty!<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span><img alt="" style="width: 300px; height: 225px;" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Hoel_LagosWksp.JPG"> </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Because my consulting philosophy combines the elements of diversity and leadership, helping organizations create an atmosphere where everyone can do their best work—<em> because </em>of differences not <em>regardless </em>of differences—this inaugural Leadership Challenge® Workshop in Lagos was an especially enlightening and rewarding experience for me. Weyinmi and I made a great team: I presented the fundamental concepts of The Five Practices from a Certified Master’s perspective and Weyinmi provided the essential cultural context that fully integrated the model directly into the Nigerian experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>And we both look forward to future collaborations. The Leadership Challenge community welcomed Weyinmi at this year’s Forum in Scottsdale and he’s already planning to make his way to New Orleans in 2014.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, we have a second workshop scheduled for Lagos in October 2013 with hopefully three or four more in 2014.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Thank you, Weyinmi Jemide, for the opportunity to experience the vibrant Nigerian culture and to manifest collaboration with you and the extraordinary leaders from Lagos, Nigeria! </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Stephen Hoel</strong> is president of Diversity Leadership Consultants.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>“What differentiates a credible person from a credible leader is that leaders have a point of view.” And with that succinct clarity, Barry Posner opened the recently concluded Leadership Challenge Forum 2013 in the welcoming Four Seasons Resort in Scottsdale. Amid the breathtaking beauty of the Pinnacle Mountains, nearly 200 eager learners came together to explore, define, and articulate a collective vision for the future of leadership and for our own practice as leaders. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Opening with the first-ever Vision Workshop, Barry and Jim Kouzes facilitated a powerful, interactive experience that truly set the stage for the next two days—48 hours jam packed with case study, activity, and skill-building breakout sessions, plenty of community building, networking opportunities, and two truly memorable keynotes that seamlessly connected all the ways in which to envision the future: reflect on your past, attend to the present, prospect the future, and feel your passion. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>With acclaimed photojournalist Steve Uzzell, for example, we traveled the open road through a series of stunning photographs that helped open our minds to the various ways we can renew, refresh, and restore our vision. Along the way, Steve shared insights from his experience as a photographer and inspirational speaker as he challenged us to clarify our own images of leadership and to nurture that clarifying skill in those we train and lead. And he reminded us all that “Knowing where you want to end up lets you know where you need to start.”</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Truly a model of the notion that “leaders believe they are here for something to do”, influential activist, author, and co-founder of Vital Voices Global Partnership Alyse Nelson took the stage to take us on an even more global—yet equally awe-inspiring—journey to explore how brave and visionary women around the world are living The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® as they risk everything to promote change and improve the lives of others.<span>&nbsp; </span>As our world becomes more connected and nations around the world work to define visions for progress, Alyse and the stories of Vital Voices provided inspiration to consider new ways to tap into everyone’s full potential, to fuel both economic growth and a new model of leadership. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Even more inspiration and learning is in store for 2014. Plans are already underway for New Orleans, June 19 – 20, 2014.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>For the past three decades, the rise of land trusts throughout the U.S. has been a remarkable movement in environmental protection and citizen engagement.<span>&nbsp; </span>Over 1,500 land trusts now operate to protect local landscapes using a variety of sophisticated tools, including purchase, easements, and agricultural preservation.<span>&nbsp; </span>To-date, these grass-roots efforts have placed more than 10 million acres of land in permanent protection. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to being a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge and a long-time member of the TLC community, I’ve been engaged in the environmental field for many years, including a rewarding 8 years as Director of Staff Development for the Trust for Public Land. While my work then focused on the development of the dedicated professionals currently working to protect our land and all that live on it, my passion these days is to help develop the next generation of leaders who will carry on this immensely important work.<span>&nbsp; </span>And in March of this year, I sought out a wonderful opportunity that allowed me to continue to strengthen a movement that is shaping the American landscape in significant ways and is so very important to me. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As part of a three-day conference sponsored by The California Council of Land Trusts, I had the privilege of leading a group of up-and-coming land trust leaders through The Leadership Challenge® Workshop.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was truly inspiring to help prepare these folks for the challenges they will face as they strive to make a difference in the world. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Using The Leadership Challenge® Workshop agenda as a framework (adapting it to the work environment of these young conservationists), I also incorporated the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI).<span>&nbsp; </span>Individual LPI reports generated insight into their current leadership practice and also helped broaden our discussion around the role leaders play in land protection efforts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All the participants expressed great appreciation for being given this opportunity to develop their leadership abilities.<span>&nbsp; </span>For Angela Hartman of the Muir Heritage Land Trust, for example, “The workshop was an eye-opener. It showed me that I DO have the capacity to make a positive impact with my work and my life. I’m now more confident in my abilities and more aware of the potential we all have to be leaders.” </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Any leadership class brings new insights—and this one was no different.<span>&nbsp; </span>Like Angela, I know that each of these young leaders will become more adept in leading others as a result of their Leadership Challenge experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, I gained fresh insight, too. I have a greater understanding of how to successfully engage younger people in the workshop, using examples from their own experience as well as mine. The new perspectives we all gained will allow us to see the future in a new way, and provide us with skills we’ll need to navigate the uncertain waters ahead.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/thankyou.jpg" class="image_Float_Left">When we consider the need to “inspire a shared vision” in our society, it’s hard to imagine a more essential cause than land preservation—how we understand, protect, and care for our environment.<span>&nbsp; </span>By introducing The Leadership Challenge to this group of high-potential young conservation professionals, we made one small step toward ensuring a healthier world—a sentiment perfectly captured by Sarah Pilkington of the Northcoast Regional Land Trust, who said it best: “I have been fortunate to be both a student and facilitator of many leadership trainings in the past. This particular Leadership Challenge® Workshop was one of the more useful and impactful experiences I have had. It brought together leaders from the conservation field with shared passion, challenges, and dreams. It was validating and empowering to view leadership from this context and to see how our growth as leaders can impact the work we are currently engaged in.”</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Dan Schwab</strong> is a Certified Master and a 20+-year veteran working with The Leadership Challenge.

So along with the goals that you set and the measurement system that you put in place, make sure to create some ways to reward yourself for achieving your goals. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Take yourself out to lunch—and ask a good friend to go with you. Mark the achievement in red pen in your calendar, knowing that every time you look at it you’ll get a big smile on your face for accomplishing something. Brag about it to a colleague. Use one of your regular meetings to announce your progress to your team. They will applaud. It’s okay to toot your own horn every now and then. By the way, it’s also okay to ask others for positive feedback: “Tell me something I did well today.” You need that, too.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Excerpted from the <em>Leadership Practices Inventory Planner, 4<sup>th</sup> edition</em>, James M.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>“I want you to grow up to be leaders, whether in church…or as President of the United States”—Maria Arias Evans, Principal, <img alt="" width="255" height="169" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Washington_Assembly_896.jpg" class="image_Float_Right">Washington Elementary School<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Located in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the San Jose Unified School District, <a href="http://www.sjusd.org/washington">Washington Elementary School</a> serves a community that struggles daily with undocumented status, drugs, gangs, prostitution, and other crimes. With a student population of 500 in grades K to 5, 95% of the children are Latino, 95% receive free or reduced lunch, and 75% are English Language Learners. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite what may first appear as overwhelming educational challenges, over the years school administrators and teachers have championed parent and community involvement, and have made tremendous headway in creating more positive and hopeful futures for many of the school’s first-generation Americans. In fact, last year Washington Elementary moved from the lowest possible State of California ranking among schools with similar demographics and characteristics (a score of 1) to a 10!</p> <p>Thanks to a connection with Barry and Jackie Posner through Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business community engagement initiative, school principal Maria Arias Evans is now a wonderful exemplar of The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. <span>&nbsp;</span>“How lucky I was to meet Jackie last year,” Maria says. “She has opened so many doors for the children of Washington Elementary.” And after receiving a copy of Barry and Jim Kouzes’ book, <em>The Truth About Leadership</em>, Maria continued, “I noted that its 10 chapters made 10 great monthly themes for the school calendar and have proceeded to work with students, teachers, and parents on how to increase the leadership potential of our school community.” </p> <p> All Washington Elementary staff and teachers have now read the book and use one new “Truth” each month to guide lesson-planning. Working together they are translating each of the 10 truths into a meaningful statement for both students and the greater community. For instance, they have translated Truth #1—You Make a Difference—into A Can-Do Attitude. They talked about this concept with the kids, creating contests, writing projects, and other activities that helped demonstrate what a “Can-Do Attitude” means to them. <span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dedicated Washington Elementary volunteer Brian O’Halloran is another strong advocate of The Five Practices. A semi-retired senior executive with a major construction firm based in the community, Brian attended a Leadership Challenge program many years ago which he now draws upon in his volunteer work with both students and parents. He currently hosts a leadership club for about 50 fifth-grade boys, and a similar leadership club for fifth-grade girls. In addition, he recently started a leadership training program for parents—mostly non-English speakers, with grade school-only educations. </p> <img alt="" width="306" height="205" src="http://www.webany.net/Sites/wiley-tlc/UserFiles/Washington_Assembly_11H.JPG" class="image_Float_Right"> <p>And this past April, Barry was the featured guest at the school-wide assembly held to help motivate students in advance of their standardized testing period. Greeted by posters and cheers, Barry opened his presentation with an inspiring story culled from <em>The </em><em>Truth About Leade</em><em>rs</em><em>hip</em>: the story of Melissa Poe that clearly demonstrates how an elementary school student can make a difference. After fielding questions, Oprah-style, from Maria and a number of students (including a discussion on how exactly one writes a book), the focus shifted to acknowledging a student from each class who had demonstrated a Can-Do Attitude—for the extra time they have put into preparing for their upcoming tests. Special recognition also was given to a wide variety of special-interest clubs supported by the school, which give every student the opportunity to make a difference.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;As Jackie Posner observed, “While The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® was initially developed with and for the corporate sector, it certainly is inspiring to see how this powerful leadership model now is inspiring and driving an entire community to develop our next generation of great leaders.”</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Marisa Holland Kelley</strong> is an Associate Editor for The Leadership Challenge® brand, focusing on training and assessment products, web content, and community programming.</p>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>As an intent observer of human behavior, two merging observations have led me to detect a dip in the level of self-confidence people have these days. First, I hear very few people describe their work as a slam dunk (or another similar term). Work these days is a struggle, with plenty of question marks. &nbsp;And as a result of the amount of ongoing change that is impacting our lives, I also hear greater uncertainty about whether the job can even be done, let alone one’s own capability to do it. &nbsp;The end result is that while people are feeling more exposed by the constant onslaught of change, coupled with tentativeness about the job itself, their performance expectations still continue to rise. Metaphorically, people question how they can possibly run faster, when the track has turned to quicksand.</p> <p>We all know that confidence is an important factor in delivering outstanding performance. Top performers may not be 100% certain about closing the big deal or winning the championship game, but they are genuinely confident in their abilities to always be in a good position to win. Likewise, the very best leaders are those who act with confidence even while staring in the face of uncertainly (which there seems to be plenty of in the crazy world today).</p> <p>Fortunately there are a couple of things we all can do as leaders to combat the growing self-doubt in others (and in ourselves, for that matter). </p> <p>First, pay close attention to your own and others’ feelings of self-confidence. Don’t assume it is still high just because it once was. Check in occasionally to see how others are doing. Because of its importance, you should monitor levels of confidence as closely as you do many of your other strategic assets.</p> <p>My second suggestion: Encourage, Encourage, Encourage. And then, Encourage some more. This may be the leader behavior with the greatest leverage. At International Leadership Associates, we learned from our work with Motorola years ago about the impact of recognition during change. Greg William, a VP in the semi-conductor division at that time, did his homework and proclaimed during a video documentary that the reason change was much slower to take root in some areas compared to others was because of a lack of recognition. From research and personal experiences, we also know that one of the key failures of change is the failure to finish. The key culprit in this failure is the lack of recognition of progress, and reinforcement of skill or performance improvement. Encouragement works.</p> <p>In addition to research, the most powerful examples are often right with us in our everyday world. For example, I began sensing a great deal of self-doubt in a young woman with whom I work—for the first time in her career. When I approached her about what I was observing she said her boss never, ever acknowledged her efforts in any way. And that vacuum of validation left her wondering…Is she living up to expectations? Is her worth in the company going down? Should she be concerned about her future there? The seed of doubt was planted in a previously very confident and solid performer. Think about the amount of turmoil in her head, and the impact it could have on her results. Sadly, it was not uncontrollable external changes that upended this woman’s belief in herself; it was the completely controllable (and disabling) behavior of her boss.</p> <p>So, remember how powerful encouragement is in building confidence and how detrimental the absence of it can be, and make strengthening the self-confidence of others an intentional part of your leadership agenda. Helping your people through the quicksand of doubt might be one of your most essential roles you will play this year. </p> <p><strong>Steve Coats</strong>, a Leadership Challenge® Certified Master, is a managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a Platinum Sponsor of The Leadership Challenge Forum 2013.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Named one of “150 Women Shaking the World” by Newsweek, Alyse Nelson, president and CEO of Vital Voices Global Partnership, will take the stage at this year’s <a href="http://www.leadershipchallengeforum.com" target="_blank">Leadership Challenge Forum</a> for what is destined to be a profound and memorable experience. An influential activist working to empower women around the globe, Alyse will provide a truly rare and awe-inspiring opportunity for attendees to hear first-hand how her dedication to helping others find their voice, to become agents for change, has made a profound difference in the lives of individuals, families, communities, and countries. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>From her tenure as deputy director of the Vital Voices Global Democracy Initiative at the U.S. Department of State (under the auspices of then-First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright) to leading Vital Voices Global Partnership, Alyse has made it her and the organization’s mission to identify, invest in, and bring visibility to extraordinary women (and men) around the world.<span>&nbsp; </span>More than 14,000 emerging leaders in over 144 countries have received vital support, training, and mentoring.<span>&nbsp; </span>And they, in turn, have ‘paid leadership forward’—training and mentoring an additional half-million more women and girls in their communities. With the vision and passion of an exemplary leader, Alyse has helped unleash the leadership potential of women leaders and social entrepreneurs worldwide, enabling them to transform their lives and accelerate peace and prosperity in their communities.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Frequently featured in international and national media, Alyse recently blogged at <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alyse-nelson/malala-fund_b_2617475.html"><span>HuffingtonPost</span></a> an article profiling15-year-old Malala Yousafzai who survived an attempted assassination because of her outspoken advocacy of education and empowerment of girls in Pakistan. Capturing the feelings of many who have been inspired by the bravery of young Malala, Alyse wrote, “Malala is a leader. She reminds us that leadership is not about title, position, or age. It's about the actions that you take and the decisions that you make on a daily basis. It's about values that endure, uncompromised. It's about conviction and sacrifice, about the resolve to take risks if they bring you closer to the shared progress you envision.”</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It is that powerful and strong voice for change that participants at this year’s Leadership Challenge Forum will have the joy of experiencing. From working with global leaders to put an end to human trafficking to helping entrepreneurial women in the remotest regions of Africa create self-sufficiency and economic independence, Alyse’s fully-realized global perspective will engage everyone in exploring what it means to be a strong, inclusive, cause-driven leader—a leader who will stand up and take action to achieve the extraordinary.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p> <p>Learn more about Alyse Nelson at <a href="http://www.vitalvoices.org/">VitalVoices.org</a>.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>For two full days this past March, I was privileged to offer The Leadership Challenge® Workshop to a number of leaders from various nonprofit organizations in the greater Cincinnati area. It was a wonderful experience for all of us. They enjoyed and benefited from the opportunity to come together with many of their brethren, and to focus on themselves, as individuals and leaders, for a few days. And I was inspired from meeting them and having the opportunity to work with people who unselfishly give so much of themselves in service to others. They are the true role models of servant leadership.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Attending were people from agencies that serve the elderly, the developmentally disabled, struggling families, the homeless who need a meal, and so many others. They face the same leadership challenges as every other organization, but for most, every spare penny they raise goes to providing care to those in need. Little is ever left over for personal or organization development. And that’s where our program, called The Gift of Leadership, made such a profound difference.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our long-time partner, Camp Joy, donated their venue for this endeavor—a truly magical place for The Leadership Challenge. It offers a wide array of outside experiential activities, including a high ropes course, which we have found anchors in the lessons of The Five Practices better than any other methodology we have ever discovered. The evening camp fire and cabin style sleeping arrangements also add a terrific relationship building opportunity. There is one other extremely special reason we have used this venue for over 25 years. Camp Joy is itself a non-profit whose original mission continues to focus on providing a life-changing camping experience for underserved or at-risk children. That mission is significantly funded by the for-profit companies whose leaders attend our The Leadership Challenge® Workshops there. It is a heartwarming feeling for our clients and all of us at ILA to know that thousands of children, in very difficult circumstances, have benefited from this partnership. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Although cold and snowy outside (inclement weather did not dampen our outdoor learning experiences), there was amazing warmth among the participants. Great friendships were made and there are already signs of new, collaborative relationships. Since the program, many have shared interviewing and hiring practices, performance management and other processes. They are generously sharing what they can to help each other out. And they are continuing to encourage each other's hearts. We are already working to nail down a date in October for a reunion and "booster shot”.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There is one last piece of the story yet to unfold. My vision, now being shared by more and more, has always been to provide The Leadership Challenge to agencies like these on a somewhat regular basis. The Cincinnati community can only benefit as the nonprofits become better. And leadership development is one of the key strategies that will enable these agencies to grow, flourish, and serve more people in need. The unofficial name for one of our ongoing initiatives is being called the "Chump Change Challenge”. With just a handful of corporate sponsors, providing an amount of money they won't even miss (chump change), we can offer this program twice a year, to more and more deserving and aspiring leaders. We already have a few long-term clients who have signed on to help. Fingers are crossed!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our deep thanks to Singapore-based Certified Master Martin Tan for challenging all of us to give back. Thanks also to our friends at Wiley for enthusiastically donating the materials as part of our<strong> </strong>Masters Give Back initiative, and to everyone at Camp Joy for generously providing the perfect place. Together, these partners have already made a positive impact on a number of servant leaders in the Cincinnati area, and the individuals and families they serve.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Steve Coats</strong>, a Leadership Challenge® Certified Master, is a managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a leadership development education and consulting firm.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>For many years, I have been interested in the work of Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, Professor Emeritus and founder of the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.&nbsp; Only recently, however, have I come to fully realize the incredible impact that mindful practices can have for leaders—especially when used to identify and adhere to our core values as we Model the Way for others.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What is Mindfulness? </strong></p> <p>As described by Dr. Kabat-Zinn, Mindfulness is as if we are “falling awake”. It is a discipline that focuses on the body and the mind in a way that can help keep us fully aware—in the moment.&nbsp; It is about slowing down our automatic, knee-jerk reactions to people and events and taking time to consider what’s truly important.&nbsp; The regular practice of mindfulness can be key to helping leaders stay on course and avoid falling victim to “auto-pilot” decision making.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>While running on auto-pilot might be okay while riding a commuter train or performing some other routine task, it can have serious consequences when we’re functioning in a business environment where the stakes are often high—both financially and ethically.&nbsp; In the financial industry, for example, I’ve spoken with high- level leaders who survived the economic turbulence of the last several years only to find themselves far removed from their core values.&nbsp; They may have started out with the best intentions to act ethically but when it was over realized they had been “riding the wave” too long, unable to say “STOP!” at the right time.&nbsp; Somehow making that “one and only exception” led them down a path to make “just one more” exception and then another. Along the way, they lost what former Medtronic CEO Bill George in his best-selling book calls their “true north”…..and we all know how the story ended. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In today’s world, it is difficult to stay focused and mindful.&nbsp; There is so much stimulation and so many demands to easily distract us. These distractions into all kinds of directions make it easy to miss the “off the wall” suggestion that could bring real innovation to our business model.&nbsp; Opportunities to Encourage the Heart might pass us by because we are operating so completely in our “auto-pilot” mode that we miss seeing and appreciating moments of individual excellence. While we are focused on the important issues of tomorrow and the day after that, we are missing the important issues of NOW, which can have a serious impact on our vision for tomorrow. That’s why I so firmly believe that moment-to-moment awareness is such a critical leadership skill, and why engaging in mindfulness practice can increase every leader’s ability to “deliberately” put into action Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Mindfulness to enhance our use of The Five Practices </strong></p> <p>How can a leader achieve the ability to observe the working of their own mind and deepen their understanding of how they make decisions?&nbsp; Just as Jim and Barry have so often said, “The key is deliberate practice, practice, practice.”&nbsp; Mindfulness takes discipline and practice but, in the end, can help leaders distinguish the important from the unimportant, identify their core values from which to set an example and, ultimately, establish greater credibility with all those who choose to follow. Mindfulness allows us to gain a clearer vision about where we want to go (and even more importantly, where we don’t!).&nbsp; And by focusing attention on our mutual “here and now”—with direct reports, colleagues and everyone important to our cause—we are able to more effectively communicate and enlist others in bringing our shared vision to life.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As Bill George described it, after engaging in mindfulness practice himself, he “was able to stay calmer and more focused in my leadership, without losing the “edge” that I believe made me successful.” A practice we can all benefit from—even if we’re not the CEO of a major Fortune 500 firm—Mindfulness can help us discover fresh contributions by team members that went unnoticed before, and find more meaningful ways to encourage their hearts. Perhaps we will become much more aware of the moment and, therefore, discover new ways to improve our lives, the lives of our teammates and colleagues, as well as the organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Mindfulness might not be for everyone, but there is an important place for it in helping leaders identify their own values, establish credibility, and make simple and effective the art and science of exemplary leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;

This is why I believe that leadership development lends itself so well to parables and metaphors, as in <span>The Lantern</span> and <span>The Lighthouse.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span>In our work in the Asian region, we find that one of the greatest stresses leaders face</span> is the tension between their goal and the journey they must travel to achieve their reality.</p> <p>And this leadership parable often helps, ahem, throw some light on this tension.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the concerns participants in our Leadership Challenge® Workshop have is how to ‘set the direction’ for the way ahead and also how to communicate that path, especially when the way ahead is not clear We hear these comments most often during the extended sessions we conduct that focus on the two Practices, Model the Way and Inspire a Shared Vision.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>The Lantern and the Lighthouse</strong></p> <p><strong>1. The Lighthouse.</strong> In most cases we have some idea of the direction we are expected to go. We have, in the distance, some reference point or Lighthouse that we can refer our followers to. Our job as leaders then is to make that light as clear and vivid as possible. This is why we need to Inspire a Shared Vision. But first, we must point out the path or way ahead. In this case, we need to create a clear strategy, and in our work we use a strategic thinking <a target="_blank" href="http://www.talent-technologies.com/new/2013/01/strategic-thinking-model/"><span>Model</span></a> to do that.<span>&nbsp; </span>By creating a strategy and communicating it effectively, we can be more confident that our team will go in the direction we need them to go.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>2. The Lantern.</strong> But what if the way ahead is not clear? What if it is foggy and there is nothing we can do about it? This is when we use The Lantern. Sometimes we can’t see where a path is leading. In this case we need simply to push on, communicating as much as possible, in order to throw enough light to see a few feet ahead. The Chinese call this ‘<span>wading across the river, feeling the stones along the way’</span>. While this may be more stressful than having a Lighthouse to guide our way, your followers will feel less stressed if they are engaged in the process. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We can look to tools used in project management as another way of seeing how this might be applied. For example, the Lighthouse is more like a methodology using GANTT in which we articulate our end goal and work backwards from that. The Lantern is more similar to Agile in which we work forward, iteratively—learning as we go, not sure exactly what the end result may be. As a leader, the key thing is to use one or the other. (Or following the model set by such exemplary leaders as polar explorer Ernest Shackleton, we use both.) <span>&nbsp;</span>If the fog remains without the leader providing either a Lantern or a Lighthouse, that’s when followers begin to doubt, when confidence drains, and when stress levels rise. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Leadership is <span>Both</span> Strategy and Struggle</strong></p> <p>As Kouzes and Posner tell us in The Leadership Challenge, “Leadership is the art of mobilizing others to want to struggle for shared aspirations”. The word ‘struggle’ is self-explanatory (and very familiar to all of us, I’m sure!) The word ‘aspiration’ is imbued with the concept of an end result or goal.<br> <br> <img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/settingthedir.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 151px;"></p> <p><a href="http://www.talent-technologies.com/new/2013/01/leadership-parable-the-lantern-and-the-lighthouse/"> </a></p> <p>Leadership is essentially both. Five-Star General and U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower said that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable. With leadership, it’s always <span>the process that matters</span>.</p> <p><span><input type="hidden" value="4c25e4ec94" name="akismet_comment_nonce"></span></p> <strong>Nick Talent</strong>, CEO of Talent Technologies (Asia) Co.

Believe it or not, it wasn’t chocolate! It was “Ladies Day” at The Leadership Challenge Workshop®.&nbsp; On a bitterly frigid morning, members of The Leadership Council of Human Services Executives, a coalition representing nonprofits serving the Greater Cincinnati area, gathered together to look at their organizations and themselves through the lens of leadership.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It gave me great joy to invite this distinguished group of leaders to a two-day workshop filled with opportunities to explore and discover what it takes to be an exemplary leader—especially in these difficult times of funding cuts to many social service nonprofits. Thanks to the 25<sup>th</sup> Leadership Challenge Anniversary Masters Give Back initiative and the support of Pfeiffer, we were able to equip these leaders with the knowledge, skills, and tools they need to “achieve the extraordinary’ in their organizations. For me to be able to give something back to this illustrious group was a privilege. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Collectively, these extraordinary women faithfully serve the community in various ways. Although they may offer very different social service programs, the representatives of these nonprofit agencies came together like a symphony. There were many different voices, but with one common purpose: to serve.&nbsp; The missions of these agencies blended together like the colors of a kaleidoscope. You could see how their working together created a beautiful aura. The leaders spent two days focusing on the future of their communities and how to achieve excellence in their work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Who were they and why did they come? They represented faith-based organizations that provide food and assistance to those in need, and agencies that support the needs of our senior citizens. They came to help ensure that Cincinnati area youth graduate from high school. They came to find new ways to inspire visions that would allow senior citizens to live their lives with meaning and purpose. They came to learn how to more effectively help willing and capable people living in poverty. The nurses came, who wanted to bring quality healthcare to those in their nursing homes. These leaders came to bring justice and equity to our communities. They came to change the world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Each organization came with its own unique challenges but shared what nearly every nonprofit in the U.S. faces: nonprofits live on an economic fiscal cliff as they compete for dwindling resources. Life in the nonprofit world is much like an inverted pyramid: the need for services continues to expand as financial support to fund the essential resources continues to decline, getting smaller and smaller, narrower and narrower. Finding balance is a leader’s most daunting challenge. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our unique Leadership Challenge Workshop® offered this group an opportunity to share: &nbsp;how they were challenged to lead their organizations through tremendous change as they experience mergers, layoffs, and new levels of accountability; how they Challenge the Process frequently, creatively figuring out how to deliver great services in spite of deep and drastic budget cuts.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When we listened to the stories and struggles of these leaders, we also heard their deeply rooted commitment, passion to serve, and a need to care.&nbsp; At the end of the day, this esteemed group of The Leadership Council clearly believed that they had to be great leaders who work together for the good of all the community.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When asked what they wanted to accomplish over the two days, they told us they wanted:</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>To be a more inspiring leader</li> 
                <li>To enhance their community leadership</li> 
                <li>To demonstrate positive leadership </li> 
                <li>To foster positive relationships</li> 
                <li>To foster accountability</li> 
                <li>To build great cultures</li> 
               </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>While it may have been frigid outside, the energy generated by these executives kept our room quite toasty.&nbsp; As we delved into The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® they found new inspiration, new hope, new challenges, and new friends. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Without a doubt, nonprofit agencies today are challenged by funding cuts and higher demands of their services. Yet, these leaders persevered because of their unwavering passion to serve others. They were challenged to think differently about leadership and the changing environment of social services. And in the end, they challenged themselves to become more effective and better leaders.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One participant summed up the two days best by saying, “I have finally found a leadership workshop that shows me step by step what I need to change in order to become a more effective leader.”</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Leadership Council participants send their special thanks to Pfeiffer for their generous donation of materials. Without their support, this opportunity would not have been affordable to many. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>How do you change the world?

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Here we are already in March of the New Year. And the question is…Have you stuck to any of the resolutions you made a few months back? Perhaps you set a goal to get to the gym more and eat healthier? Or was it something loftier, even inspirational: a desire to improve yourself, professional growth, or to develop your leadership abilities? </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Whatever your goal may be, you already know that you can’t simply SAY you want to do something and it magically happens. You have to have strategies and tactics to make change a reality. So what can you do to change behavior and make change stick this year, and for many years to come? Here are three keys to behavior change to get you going:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> 
               <ol> 
                <li>Be Specific – Focus on behavior you can see and count</li> 
                <li>Be Accountable - Create opportunities for feedback</li> 
                <li>Set a Timeline – Track your progress and readjust the plan</li> 
               </ol> <p>By way of example, let’s suppose that you want to focus on one of The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®, to improve how you Inspire a Shared Vision with others. What are the strategies and tactics you could use to change your behavior and improve your effectiveness in this area? </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> 
               <ol> 
                <li>Be Specific </li> 
               </ol> <p>One of the keys to successful and lasting behavior change is to be very specific about what behavior you want to change. In fact, the first critical error we often make in setting a New Year’s Resolution is that it is too vague. So we recommend that you first choose a behavior you can see and count; identify how often you are engaging in the behavior currently; and then set a goal for yourself. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Leaders inspire others with their vision for the future and empower others to participate to make that vision a reality. A shared vision moves companies forward. If the goal is to Inspire a Shared Vision, be specific and define what behaviors you want to increase to make it happen. Do you find it challenging to create and describe images of what the future may look like? If so, start there. Or, do you have a harder time communicating with others about why they should be energized by the direction you are headed? Perhaps the first step is to outline your vision for the future and identify the key concepts to share.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Let’s assume it’s the latter that you want to work on – helping others understand where you are headed and what that means for them? Here is a clear and specific way you could state that goal:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>“I want to increase the frequency with which I talk with others about the company’s vision and how their needs will be met as we make progress toward this vision. To do this, I will include the company vision in our weekly staff meetings and talk with each team member at least weekly about their goals, giving them feedback on how I believe their goals can be met by achieving our vision.”</em></p> <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Now that you have set a specific behavioral goal, your next step is to identify how frequently you talk about, write about, or prompt others to explore this vision currently. This is your baseline data. If you want to see progress, you need to be realistic about how frequently the behavior is currently happening. Ultimately, you want to choose a behavior that you can track for progress, so that you can clearly see when progress is made.</p> <p>&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Be Accountable<br> <br> </p> <p>Once you have identified a behavior you want to change, how do you track progress? Are you going to be tracking your own progress? Are you going to do this daily, weekly, or monthly? If you are serious in your desire to make progress, perhaps you should consider an added layer of accountability. People often act very differently when they know that they must be accountable to another person. When someone else is going to be checking in on your progress you may be more likely to stay true to your goal. Is there a colleague, supervisor, or coach you could let in on your goal to help keep you motivated and accountable? Can an aspect of your goal be added to a daily task list, weekly staffing meeting or even a company newsletter?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Focusing on our example of Inspire a Shared Vision, explore who might be appropriate to give you some feedback. It may be a direct report. Or, better yet, let your whole team know that you are working on this for your own leadership development and ask for their feedback. Personal growth and improvement can be infectious, motivating others to share their own goals while supporting you. Consider scheduling check-ins with team members for feedback. This can even be done by email to keep things simple. </p> <br> 
               <div style="text-align: left;">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Set a Timeline
                <br> 
                <br> 
               </div> <p>Of course, setting a timeline for success—with deadlines—is essential to help keep the end-goal in mind. Intermediate or short-term benchmarks can help you stay on track. Include dates to check in with yourself, your coach, or others. Make realistic benchmarks for success, focusing on doing more of what’s working while discontinuing strategies that are not. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Remember to take time to assess your progress and take pride in your accomplishments. As you work to be more effective in Inspiring a Shared Vision, perhaps you are finding it more comfortable to talk with people one-on- one, but struggle when it comes to inspiring the team as a group. By all means, continue those one-on-one conversations. Also ask yourself if there is a way to add that comfort you feel to the larger group? Would different tactics work better for you? Writing out what you want to say? Asking the group to identify group goals that mirror their own personal goals? </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Mark your calendar! Somehow work your changes into each day on your calendar. Set up meetings to talk with constituents about their goals. Emphasize the shared vision in regular meetings or brainstorming sessions. Daily practice is essential to success. Change requires constant reassessment and maintenance until the goal is accomplished and the new behavior becomes integrated into your natural repertoire. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Behavior change as a leader can be difficult. When all eyes are on YOU, a change in your behavior can feel painfully obvious. We don’t like to feel we’re on stage, displaying our failures. However, successful leaders take risks (Challenge the Process), Model the Way, and Inspire a Shared Vision for future growth and development—both personal and professional. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For additional support along the way, check out <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/leadership-challenge-mobile/id485416164?mt=8">The Leadership Challenge Mobile Tool</a> where you can set daily reminders, personalize your Action Plan, ask for feedback, and much more.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>“Great leaders make great workplaces.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I heard Barry Posner say this last year in a session in Glendale, CA. Now, I’m fortunate to be watching it happen in real time with The Leadership Challenge<span>®</span> helping to make engagement a reality in my organization.</p> <p>I know that in this post-“great recession” world, we are all working harder with fewer resources. But here, our people truly work hard. The industries in which we operate (trade shows and hospitality) demand long days, nights, weekends and holidays to get the job done.<span>&nbsp; </span>In order to maintain our competitive position and continue to be successful as an organization, employee engagement is critical. And that’s why the vision of our human resources team is to build an engaged and fully effective workforce—and to accomplish that in an environment where stress is high, schedules are tight, and work life balance sometimes seems like myth.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>While we know it is a challenge, we also know there are quantifiable benefits to creating a work environment where people are highly engaged.&nbsp; According to the <a href="http://www.towerswatson.com/research/7177">Towers Watson 2012 Global Workforce Study</a>, companies with an engaged workforce experience:</p> 
               <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"> 
                <li>6.5 fewer days absent</li> 
                <li>41% lower retention risk</li> 
                <li>3X higher operating margins</li> 
               </ul> <p>These are huge bottom line business benefits.<span>&nbsp; </span>But engagement isn’t just good for companies. It’s also good for employees. People who are engaged are just happier at work. For us, the profile of an engaged employee that we use is the one described by Paul Marciano, Ph.D., in his book <a href="http://www.paulmarciano.com/thebook/"><em>Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work</em></a>.<span>&nbsp; </span>He writes that an engaged employee:</p> 
               <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"> 
                <li>Brings new ideas to work</li> 
                <li>Is passionate and enthusiastic about work</li> 
                <li>Takes initiative</li> 
                <li>Actively seeks to improve self, others and the business</li> 
                <li>Consistently exceeds goals and expectations</li> 
                <li>Is curious and interested; asks questions</li> 
                <li>Encourages and supports team members</li> 
                <li>Is optimistic and positive; smiles</li> 
                <li>Overcomes obstacles and stays focused on tasks; is persistent</li> 
                <li>Is committed to the organization</li> 
               </ul> <p>This is the type of workforce we are working hard to create. Unfortunately, according to the Towers Watson data, only 37% of employees are actively engaged which means we all have a lot of work to do, in my own company as well as in many, many others around the world. </p> <p>As we journey to create an environment where everyone is engaged, we are fortunate to have the CEO, who from the outset was heavily influenced by the data, as our biggest supporter. Like many CEOs, he needed to see the evidence. And that’s one of the many reasons we selected The Leadership Challenge<span> as our primary approach to developing leaders, using the</span> Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI) assessment as the foundation for the course<span>. </span>Since its inception, the LPI has been used to obtain feedback from over 3 million individuals. And the evidence from 30 years of research continues to make it clear that when leaders increase the frequency of the LPI behaviors, they are more effective. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p>But, what about the link between leadership and engagement?<span>&nbsp; </span>Going back to the Towers Watson research, it identifies specific focus areas that help enable and energize employees. Interestingly, the top drivers of sustainable engagement are not big paychecks or luxury corporate campuses. Rather, leader behaviors are the key to an engaged workforce. And there is a clear link between many of the leader behaviors identified by the research that help engagement and <span>The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership</span>®.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example:</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Good understanding of organization’s business goals and steps needed to reach those goals (Inspire a Shared Vision)</li> 
                <li>Understanding of how job contributes to the organization achieving its business goals (Inspire a Shared Vision)</li> 
                <li>Treats me with respect (Model the Way)</li> 
                <li>Encourages new ideas and new ways of doing things (Challenge the Process)</li> 
                <li>Acts in ways consistent with his or her own words (Model the Way)</li> 
                <li>Effective career development discussions (Enable Others to Act)</li> 
               </ul> <p>Our senior leaders have completed The Leadership Challenge® Workshop and we are currently working with them to strengthen their understanding of how their learnings from the workshop and their LPI results connect with our corporate goals to increase employee engagement. We are very pleased to be seeing progress: leaders who have completed the workshop and are focused on increasing the frequency of their LPI behaviors already saw an improvement in their 2012 Employee Engagement Survey Scores!</p> <p>While we still have many leaders to train—and I have many, many more times to talk about the link between leadership and engagement—we’ve already reaped an unexpected benefit. Our entire HR team is truly excited and committed. We believe that anyone can learn to lead an engaged and energized team. And although we know it’s a journey, we are well underway.</p> <p><strong>Melissa Lanier </strong>is a Certified Master-in-Training of The Leadership Challenge® and The Director of Global Talent Management at an S&amp;P Small Cap 600 company.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>"Think global, but act local" is not just a phrase for sustainability; it also can be applied to how we behave as leaders. It turns out our most important role models are "local". They are the people with whom we interact and have contact with the most. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner continually want to know who leaders view as their role models for leadership. What is striking about their collected data is that given categories from which to choose, most leaders over age 30 report that a family member has had the most influence on them (46%). Business leaders or direct supervisors account for 23%, followed by teachers or coaches at 14%. These are the people we learn from.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Carol Dweck, a social psychologist at Stanford, adds to this inquiry in her studies on the difference between individuals who have a growth mindset compared to those with a fixed mindset. If we see leadership as something we can learn and a skill we can acquire, our role models have a greater positive influence on our behavior. One of the basic foundational beliefs of The Leadership Challenge model is that extraordinary leaders are constant learners and that this mindset is necessary for effective leading.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We can draw two conclusions from these observations: 1) Our role models from our youth continue to influence our values and behaviors as leaders, and 2) they become integrated into or compared with those in our professional world who also affect us most closely, our managers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As a leader, do you believe that you continue to learn from your role models? The questions below may prompt some thought and discovery.</p> 
               <ol> 
                <li>The most important role model from my past or present is:</li> 
                <li>The lessons or messages about leadership that I learned are:</li> 
                <li>Is leadership something I can learn?</li> 
               </ol> <p>By reflecting on these inquiries, you'll likely be thankful for people who have inspired and motivated you along your developmental path. Sometimes our role models taught us lessons that were not spoken but observable—they modeled the way by "walking the talk." Kouzes and Posner's research would concur: "The life you lead is the legacy you leave."</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span>Holly Seaton, Ph.D.,</span></strong><span> is a Coaching Practice Leader and Leadership Challenge® Workshop Facilitator with Sonoma Leadership Systems.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p><strong>Giving back through love and the lessons of Mahatma Gandhi </strong></p> <p><img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/HoelGandhiPhoto200.gif" class="image_Float_Right">Following this year’s Leadership Challenge Forum in San Francisco, I had one of the most rewarding and life-changing experiences. During the traditional post-Forum event for members of the Certified Master Network, our colleague from Singapore, Martin Tan, shared with us a brilliant program that truly got me excited. </p> <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p><span>Masters Give Back</span> is a cooperative program between Publisher (Pfeiffer, A Wiley Brand and publisher of this newsletter as well) and members of the Certified Master Network that promotes the donation of time and resources to presenting The Leadership Challenge Workshop® to a non-profit or charitable organization—to those who couldn’t otherwise afford the expense. With Masters Give Back, they would now have that chance. The exciting and rewarding aspect for me was that it totally fit into my yearly commitment to do something to give back to the community.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Leaving San Francisco and the Forum behind, I went in search of the right opportunity where I could make a difference with my donation. And I found just what I was looking for one Sunday when the Spiritual Leader of our Christ Church Unity of Orlando, Reverend Cynthia Alice Anderson, made an announcement. She was planning an eight-week series called “The Season for Nonviolence”. Based on the wisdom of India’s Mahatma Gandhi, the program would focus on the inner work of spiritual transformation and culminate with a visit and presentation by Dr. Arun Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi’s grandson. The flyer indicated that the church needed a major sponsor to make the “Evening with Dr. Arun Gandhi” happen and, although it wasn’t an easy decision, ultimately I realized that I was called to do this as another way of giving back. So I wrote the check for the sponsorship.<span>&nbsp; </span>An additional benefit, I thought at the time, was to get further exposure for my company, Diversity Leadership Consultants, and advertise an upcoming open enrollment of The Leadership Challenge Workshop®.<span>&nbsp; </span>Only later was I to realize a deeper purpose for my decisions and action and the even stronger connection to the purpose of our work at Diversity Leadership Consultants: to manifest collaborations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As our weekly Sunday Lessons continued, based on the book, <em>Gandhi the Man </em>by Eknath Easwaran, I learned that Gandhi became spiritually awakened throughout his life to his own spiritual transformation. And out of those lessons, I made two significant connections to the Sanskrit words <em>ahimsa</em> and <em>satyagraha</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Loosely translated <em>ahimsa</em> is unconditional love and <em>satyagraha</em> is love in action.<span>&nbsp; </span>Gandhi believed that the strongest love in action is to love your enemy and was the basis for his non-violent movement.<span>&nbsp; </span>He taught hundreds of millions of his followers how to channel anger into love through non-violence.<span>&nbsp; </span>He saw this as a way of thinking and living to put love to work in resolving problems, healing relationships, and generally raising the quality of the lives of his followers.<span>&nbsp; </span>This philosophy made a real impact because when I did my values card sort as a first-time participant in The Leadership Challenge Workshop®, my #1 value was love.<span>&nbsp; </span>It still is.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now it was finally starting to make sense, why I was motivated to spend the money to sponsor Gandhi’s grandson’s visit. But it wasn’t until a week prior to the event that I came to fully understand the true reasons. I was reading <em>Gandhi the Man</em> when I came across a passage that explained it all. During the latter part of Gandhi’s life he was asked to attend a Round Table Conference in London to represent the cause of Indian freedom.<span>&nbsp; </span>The book says that,</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>“On one occasion during the conference, Gandhi spoke eloquently before the assembled delegates for over two hours on behalf of the people of India.<span>&nbsp; </span>After he had finished, the London reporters clustered excitedly around Gandhi’s secretary, Mahadev Desai.<span>&nbsp; </span>‘How is it,’ they demanded, ‘that he is able to speak so well for such a long time without any preparation, without any prompting, without even any notes?’<span>&nbsp; </span>Desai replied, ‘What Gandhi thinks, what he feels, what he says, and what he does are all the same.<span>&nbsp; </span>He does not need notes.’<span>&nbsp; </span>Then he added smiling:<span>&nbsp; </span>‘You and I, we think one thing, feel another, say a third, and do a fourth, so we need notes and files to keep track.’”</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There was my connection!<span>&nbsp; </span>We know the foundation of leadership is credibility and doing what you say. Model the Way is all about being clear on your values and aligning actions with values.<span>&nbsp; </span>Gandhi was the epitome of that.<span>&nbsp; </span>What he believed he lived.<span>&nbsp; </span>People want to follow a person like that—someone, like Gandhi, who lived his values and had a clear higher purpose that connected with millions of others as a shared vision.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We teach in our work with The Leadership Challenge that people want to follow leaders who live their values and are transparent about who they are. That’s why I was drawn to sponsor this visit from Gandhi’s grandson. I was humbled to have been part of it and to hear stories of how Mahatma Gandhi passed on his teaching of non-violence.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was truly a cosmic and enlightening experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>And upon further reflection, I also realized that one of our most famous 20<sup>th</sup> Century American visionaries—Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who for years we’ve recognized for how his life aligned with his value system—was a student of the teachings of Gandhi.<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I think there is one last lesson here, and that is to follow your heart.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I consider what Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner have shared with so many of us—their values and enduring beliefs—I realize that they, too, have a connection here.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is a connection of shared values, of Love, Accessibility, Liberation, Collaboration, Possibility Thinking, Credibility, and Evidence. I see many parallels here to the life of Mahatma Gandhi.<span>&nbsp; </span>No wonder I am motivated to follow and embrace the teachings of Jim and Barry. Their values align with my value system. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now through the <span>Masters Give Back<em> </em></span>program, I’ll have other opportunities to give back, to present The Leadership Challenge Workshop® to a deserving group of people who otherwise would not be exposed to it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can’t wait.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Stephen Hoel</strong> is president of Diversity Leadership Consultants, a leadership development organization focusing on improving the effectiveness of leadership and team skills.

               </table> <br> Of the 2.5 million people who visited the Olympics in London this year, few would have been aware that within a javelin throw of the main gates was one of the most culturally-diverse, economically-deprived, and violent neighborhoods in Great Britain. It was here, in 2006, the majority of arrests were made of people suspected of terrorism after the 7/7 bombings in London. And at its epicenter is Waltham Forrest, now home to the Active Change Foundation and Hanif Qadir.<br> <br> Born in 1965 in the predominantly Christian community of Cleveland, UK, Hanif was still a child when his family moved to East London and the more culturally-diverse area of Walthamstow. Here he spent his most impressionable years as a teen and young adult, and later went into the motor trade with his two brothers, Imtiaz and Abad. <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But in 2002, Hanif took a detour from what appeared to be his chosen path toward a fairly traditional life. He sold what was by then a very lucrative family business and bought a one-way ticket to Pakistan. Like so many young British Muslims at the time, Hanif was angry. Incensed by what he saw happening to the innocent victims of the ‘War on Terror’ in the Middle East, his mission in leaving home was to relieve the suffering. </p> <p>The experience of being in Pakistan, however, forced Hanif to examine his own conscience and while still determined to make a difference, Hanif saw a new and more authentic path for himself. He returned to Waltham Forrest on a more personal <em>Jihad</em>: to support the vulnerable people of East London. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Hanif had found a way to refocus his anger—from a destructive force into one of constructive purposefulness. He had chosen to leave behind the world of hate-fuelled fighting and, instead, take on a different challenge: to replace despair and alienation with hope and personal growth for the young people in urban East London. He had found his leadership voice. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Within a year of Hanif’s return, the Active Change Foundation (ACF) was born. Supported by his two brothers and Mike Jervis, an authority on London gang violence, they created nothing short of a magnet for kids ‘on the street’. The tangible fruit of their hard work is a youth club, complete with gym, boxing club, prayer room, canteen, quiet areas, TV room, Internet access, a domestic violence refuge, and car workshop.&nbsp; </p> <p><img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/mural.jpg"> </p> <p>In addition to the support that the physical structure provides, the impact of Hanif’s leadership goes much deeper.&nbsp; All the members of the Active Change Foundation leadership team know first-hand the social, cultural, and faith- based challenges faced by young people in the East End. They understand how the isolation, alienation, and lack of opportunities that are endemic in that part of London lead to religious extremism, gang violence, and street crime. Hanif and his colleagues have been there, and they make no bones about their previous involvement on what they describe as <em>“the dark side”. </em>They are credible. The young people they want to reach out to and support listen to their counter-narratives for religious extremism and gang/street violence.&nbsp; They are well-networked in the local neighborhood, the media and the corridors of power. They have an uncanny <em>feel</em> for where unrest is brewing and know what needs to be done to prevent it. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Perhaps most important to the success of ACF is that the strong convictions Hanif and his team hold give them the courage to take action, and to enable others to take action as well.&nbsp; For example, through regular ‘scenario’ rehearsals, and debrief and personal mentoring, outreach workers are prepared to confront those intent on fueling and recruiting these vulnerable and susceptible young minds to violent extremism. These outreach teams can often be found on the streets of East London, engaging groups on street corners and in parks to challenge prejudices, to talk through what appeared on the evening news,&nbsp; or to debate the harassment or arrest of a friend. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Hanif also has an extraordinary ability to foster collaboration between groups of people who would otherwise struggle to work together. That’s what really defines Hanif’s leadership: his ability to act as a bridge between those in power and those outside the system, and bring both sides together to address serious social concerns. In fact, the successful work of Hanif and ACF recently caught the attention of the Forward Thinking charity and, in particular, one of its Trustees, Chris Donnelly, former advisor to NATO’s Secretary General for 16 years and well-known and well-respected in UK government circles.&nbsp; As a result of Hanif’s leadership, the ACF has received much-needed financial support and has raised awareness and concern among mainstream authorities of what people were starting to recognise as a significant domestic issue in the UK.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One very successful initiative at the ACF has been its Young Leader Programme, an ongoing series of workshops and activities based on Kouzes &amp; Posner’s The Five Practices of Exemplary LeadershipÒ framework. Started in 2008, this initiative is designed to challenge personal and collectively-held beliefs, with a goal to increase understanding and tolerance, by bringing together young people with violent and religious extremists, firemen, rape victims, police commissioners and community liaison officers, knife crime victims and perpetrators, Army Generals and Muslim Clerics &amp; Christian Bishops. All of which has led to many extraordinary educational moments for all involved. Physical group challenges, (e.g., caving, climbing, first aid training, firefighting, canoeing) are mixed with serious debate on subjects that tend to polarise opinion: The London Riots, British foreign policy, and the education of women in Pakistan.&nbsp; Specific topics are also introduced to defuse current street-level tensions (e.g., the treatment of Muslims in Gaza by Israeli forces). People are encouraged to take part as human beings—not as a representative of a particular agency or role. Meals are cooked and dishes are washed together. Human cultures, concerns and hopes are shared.</p> <p><img alt="" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/Dec12mountain.jpg"> </p> <p>We’ve watched the Young Leader Programme grow year-after-year under Hanif’s continuing guidance, reaching out with hope and purpose to those without either.&nbsp; And what we have discovered is that disaffection, alienation, and hopelessness in deprived urban environments is not restricted to only young Muslims. In fact, since 2009, we’ve come to see non-Muslim youngsters increasingly drawn to the uplifting work of ACF because the fact is that violent extremism, in all its ugly forms, is a consequence of lost hope and a lost sense of community rather than driven by any religious doctrine. There will always be extremists who prey on vulnerable youngsters to further their cause—whether&nbsp; it be religious fundamentalism, criminality, or gang warfare—by appearing to offer what many young people seek: a sense of belonging, purpose, excitement, adventure, and discipline.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Hanif’s mission, and that of the Active Change Foundation, is to ensure that youngsters living in London’s East End are not open and vulnerable to those extremist influences in the first place. ACF offers all that young people are seeking—belonging, purpose, discipline—but with a very different purpose! Hanif and his colleagues are replacing fear with hope and actively engaging people from all walks of life in building the kind of community they want to grow up in and live in. In so doing, they are converting these potentially divisive and destructive forces into constructive common purpose. Which is, after all, what all leaders do…</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Who knows how many lives Hanif and his team have changed for the better? Like most extraordinary leaders, he is not busy quantifying his impact, merely paranoid that it is inadequate. I can, however, guarantee you that he has changed at least one … Mine!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Chris Nel is a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Those who are the best at leading are also the best at learning. Exemplary leaders don’t rest on their laurels or rely on their natural talents; instead, they continually do more to improve themselves. So if you want to be the best you can be, you need to become a great learner. </p> <p>Here are some tips on how you can get the most learning out of the LPI process.</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Accept the feedback as a gift. Feedback may not come wrapped in a package with a bow, but it’s still one of the most valuable gifts you’ll ever receive. Why? Because we know from our research that leaders who are the most open to feedback are far more effective than leaders who resist hearing other people’s perspectives on their behaviors.</li> 
               </ul> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Take the feedback seriously. You might wonder, “Will it really make a difference if I increase the frequency of the behaviors measured by the LPI?” It will. Research consistently shows the same results: The more frequently you demonstrate the behaviors included in the LPI, the more likely you will be seen as an effective leader.</li>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Q:<span>&nbsp; </span>Last month I participated in The Leadership Challenge® Workshop through work and loved it. I did the Values Cards exercise during the class and then did the exercise again this month. The selections I just made turned out to be somewhat different than the ones I chose during class. Is this significant? Has there been research done as to why values might change, and what that might mean to an individual or organization?</p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p>A:<span>&nbsp; </span>Thanks for your important question.<span>&nbsp; </span>We know from our research that values drive commitment, so it’s vital to spend time getting clear about our own values and the values of our constituents. Spending the kind of time that you did on values clarification is essential to your leadership development and the engagement of your constituents. Our data indicates that when leaders are highly clear about their leadership philosophy—the values and beliefs that guide their actions and decisions—their constituents are 40% more engaged in their work compared to constituents whose leaders are not clear about their leadership philosophy. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Renowned social psychologist Milton Rokeach, creator of the widely-used Rokeach Value Survey, spent his career exploring the subject. He refers to values as<em> enduring beliefs</em> and finds that values are preferences that last over time and across most contexts. In other words, your core values are likely to be mostly the same at home, at work, and in the community.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>That said, it may take several iterations of a values clarification exercise to truly uncover your enduring beliefs. Doing the exercise in a workshop is a valuable first step, but we’d encourage you to repeat the exercise several times, asking yourself not only “what are my values?” but also “why is this important to me?” Sometimes asking that second question helps you clarify which values are more enduring than others.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There is a possibility that the 5 to 7 Value Cards you selected during your workshop exercise may not have completely represented the full spectrum of your values. Because there are between 150 and 250 values words in the English language, depending upon the research one is looking at, it’s possible that the values that were different for you the second time around were simply those other values you left off your list the first time. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Additionally, context can influence certain values we select at any given time. For example, if you are asked to select “values that should guide decisions at work" you may choose one set of cards that doesn’t include a value that you chose when asked about "the values that should guide decisions and actions in your family." We find this is quite common. It suggests that we have many values that are important to us, and that some are more important in one context than in another. In addition, consider what could happen if there was some life-altering event—either positive or negative, such as winning the lottery or getting a dream job…or getting fired or a spouse passing away. Any of these types of circumstances could influence the words you select to represent your most important values at that moment in time.</p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p>We encourage you to continue your exploration until you feel that the values you select are the ones that truly represent those “enduring beliefs” that should guide you in making decisions in your life regardless of context. It’s not necessarily an easy exercise—and it may require several iterations—but it is a very important and rewarding one. </p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>Jim Kouzes</strong>, cited by The Wall Street Journal as one of the twelve best executive educators in the U.S., is the Dean’s Executive Fellow of Leadership, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Shortly after senior leadership participated in The Leadership Challenge Workshop®, Citizens Energy Group in Indianapolis embarked on a huge undertaking: the acquisition of the city's water and wastewater assets. The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® and Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI®) provided a context through which leaders drove a successful integration and continue to keep the company on course as it embarks on its new future.<br> <br> </p> <p>Acquisitions and mergers can be tremendously daunting—blending systems and processes, people and cultures, vision and values. They also can represent a golden opportunity to fuse new energy, ideas, and viewpoints into a fully redesigned business enterprise that delivers far more combined than either organization was capable of delivering on its own.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Just over one year ago, when Indianapolis-based Citizens Energy Group acquired the community’s water and wastewater utilities, it proved to be a watershed moment in the non-profit’s long history of improving the quality of life in the community while fueling economic development for the greater Indianapolis area it serves. With a clear vision, excellent communication, active participation by all stakeholders, and exemplary leadership throughout the transition, Citizens Energy Group has successfully integrated more than 400 new water and wastewater employees, created combined billing and call center functions, significantly expanded its public outreach and customer service capabilities, and increased the overall transparency of its operations to its customers. At the same time, synergies available through the acquisition have achieved more than $80 million of savings that will be passed on to customers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For a company that in 2012 was honored for the second straight year with a J.D. Power Award for customer service, Citizens Energy Group takes seriously its commitment to its employees, customers, and the community. With strong leadership at every level—beginning at the very top with President and Chief Executive Officer Carey Lykins—the organization took steps right from the start to prepare both utility groups for the merger, communicating clearly with customers and staff and celebrating milestones along the way. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Anticipating that the acquisition could create anxiety for staff, a Change Management Team was established to thoughtfully plan the integration, oversee the implementation and operational details and, most importantly, maintain the focus on involving employees in defining what was needed to make the transition as easy and successful as possible.<span>&nbsp; </span>Employing one of Citizens Energy Group’s core values—teamwork—also was important to the company’s success in rolling out this integration process in such a short period of time. A dozen teams made up of more than 100 employees from across both organizations contributed ideas about the process and were critical to solving whatever problems or challenges arose. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span>“Our vision for this acquisition was compelling and clear,” Lykins said. “This was a unique opportunity for us to greatly expand our mission and to have an even greater impact on the affordability of life in our community by providing a variety of reliable, affordable utility services. It was easy for employees to see value in that and it was easy to communicate. In fact, we worked very hard at communicating in as many ways and at as many times as possible to keep everyone informed. We reinforced messages about being open to change, to doing things in new ways at every opportunity. We were doing things we’d never done before.”<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To mark communication around the integration, Citizens Energy Group created its own brand </p> <p><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"><img alt="" style="width: 300px; height: 95px;" src="http://www.leadershipchallenge.com/UserFiles/CSI_Indy.png"> </span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p>Employees came to know that communication bearing the CSI: Indy logo was important—to the organization and to each individual. It served as a way of flagging information employees needed to know about the acquisition that would help them understand how changes would impact them and their role in the new organization. </p> <p>Citizens Energy Group also created a variety of two-way dialogue opportunities for the transition team and others to listen to employees and customers alike—from officer coffee talks to site visits by senior leaders who gathered insights and questions from those in the field. Answers to employees’ questions were then published in newsletters, memos, and in other media.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To support the organization’s ambitious communication strategies, Human Resources Director Jodi Underwood took charge of equipping leaders with change management tools and techniques, including specific training around change management and Key Messages cards to help maintain a focused approach to communication. “We made sure that our managers and senior leaders met regularly with our soon-to-be new employees at their sites,” Ms. Underwood recalled. “Our main objective was to have our new employees feel welcome. We wanted to make sure they knew that they were coming into a company that truly wanted them and respected their opinions. As a result, we made a very strong effort to treat them with dignity and respect, and to listen carefully to what they had to say.” </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>“What we learned during this monumental transition is that leadership is foundational,” she added. “You cannot wait until change is going to occur to start leadership training or start preparing leaders for the next phase. Our leaders were prepared to step up and do what they needed to do because we already had a very focused approach that was based on The Leadership Challenge and The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership<span>®</span>.” </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Through the lens of the integration, Citizens Energy Group incorporated The Five Practices into essential messages that came to help drive its success: </p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>“People follow first the person, then the plan” - Model the Way </li> 
                <li>“The vision is the force that invents the future”- Inspire a Shared Vision </li> 
                <li>“The work of the leader is change – the best leaders are the best learners”- Challenge the Process </li> 
                <li>“Exemplary leaders strengthen everyone’s capacity to deliver on the promises they make” - Enable Others to Act </li> 
                <li>“Encouragement is, curiously, serious business” - Encourage the Heart </li> 
               </ul> <p>Reflecting on the important lessons learned throughout the transition, Lykins concluded, “While there are many things that contributed to our success, at the end of the day it was leadership—I don’t mean my leadership but the leadership on those 12 teams that were so dedicated and the perseverance of every employee throughout the organization. Failure was never an option. I don’t think it even occurred to anyone along the way. We stayed the course and, as a result, now have an exciting and bright future ahead of us.” </p> <p><a href="http://youtu.be/LiNemRl0a2A">&nbsp;Watch the Citizens Energy Group ™ Story. </a></p> <p><strong>Terri Armstrong Welch</strong> is an independent writer and editor contributing to the marketing and editorial programs at Pfeiffer, including The Leadership Challenge product line.<span>&nbsp; </span>A former member of the Jossey-Bass team, she can be reached at <a href="mailto:booksmatter@comcast.net">booksmatter@comcast.net</a> and at <a href="http://yourrockstarwriter.wordpress.com">http://yourrockstarwriter.wordpress.com</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">. </span></p>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Coach your leaders with these tips as you help them identify actions they will take to practice or improve their effectiveness in Modeling the Way, specifically the LPI behavior, “I am clear about my philosophy of leadership.” Ask your leaders to: </p> <p>? Review their personal values; in one paragraph that begins with “I believe….” write down what they believe is important about their leadership. </p> <p>? On an index card, write down one point of their leadership philosophy. At the end of the week, write on the back of the card how they lived this out.</p> <p>? Write a short personal leadership mission statement and hang it in clear sight.</p> <p>? Schedule a time to record their philosophy of leadership; listen to it again to ensure it is clear and concise.</p> <p>? Create a wiki that outlines what they believe are the shared values of their team or constituents. Have members of the team or organization create, amend, or improve the published content. Use the feedback to test the leaders’ notions of leadership clarity.</p> <p>Excerpted from the <em>Leadership Practices Inventory Planner, 4<sup>th</sup> edition</em>, James M. Kouzes and Barry Z.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>As I move along in my journey to become a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge®, the more I realize that one of the most important things I can do is to help others make the connection between The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® model and an organization’s shared values.<span>&nbsp; </span>In my role as Executive Vice President at Kaneka—a specialty chemical manufacturing company—and Site Manager of the Kaneka-Pasadena, TX facility, I have taken that responsibility to heart. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img alt="" class="image_Float_Right" src="http://www.webany.net/Sites/wiley-tlc/UserFiles/kaneka150.png">Over the past five years we have made great strides in crafting and implementing an operating philosophy of leadership that drives the focus of our work at the Pasadena facility. Working with The Leadership Challenge and The Five Practices among my senior management team, we began by coming together to consider our shared values.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition to our mission and vision, the Pasadena plant leadership team wanted to create a set of core values that would bring everyone together to achieve the same goals. After collecting input from as many employees as possible, we settled on the four most frequently selected that we now refer to as our CORE VALUES:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>SAFETY</li> 
                <li>HONESTY</li> 
                <li>CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT </li> 
                <li>TEAMWORK</li> 
               </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner write in The Leadership Challenge, “Values influence every aspect of our lives: our moral judgments, our responses to others, our commitments to personal and organizational goals.”<span>&nbsp; </span>And our leadership team wanted to spread that message and The Five Practices to others, including front-line supervision and professional staff.<span>&nbsp; </span>So to that end, I recently shared the following in hopes of helping others make a meaningful connection between The Five Practices, our Core Values, and the Kaneka North America leadership culture.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>1.<span>&nbsp; </span>MODEL THE WAY<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong>»<strong><span>&nbsp; </span>HONESTY<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>»<span>&nbsp; </span>SAFETY</strong></p> <p>In Modeling the Way we must be HONEST in finding our voice by reflecting on our own personal values. By sharing our values with others, we allow them to know us better. By aligning our actions to support our core values, we demonstrate that we are committed. For Kaneka, our strongest example is in our SAFETY culture. When everyone is open and HONEST about incidents, investigations, and behaviors related to corporate social responsibility, we increase our CREDIBILITY with both our Kaneka team and our watchful community.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>2. INSPIRE A SHARED VISION<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>»<span>&nbsp; </span>HONESTY</strong></p> <p>In a similar way, when we create a vision and attempt to engage and inspire others, we must be HONEST in the content and the approach. Creating a vision requires us to think about the future AND be realistic about where the team is going.<span>&nbsp; </span>Remember that as a leader others are expecting you to DWYSYWD:<span>&nbsp; </span>Do What You Say You Will Do.<span>&nbsp; </span>So be HONEST with yourself and others by choosing short- and long-term targets that your team can commit to achieving.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>3. CHALLENGE THE PROCESS<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>»&nbsp;<span> </span>CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMNT</strong></p> <p>Kaneka is a company fueled by technology and innovation. In order to feed that fire, we must always be looking for ways to improve. The CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT spirit needs to be encouraged throughout the organization, not just in operations. Every person has good ideas on how to be more effective in their daily tasks. Let’s create a safe environment for everyone to “experiment and take risks”—to Challenge the Process.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>4. ENABLE OTHERS TO ACT<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>»<span>&nbsp; </span>TEAMWORK</strong></p> <p>None of us are really ever successful without the help of others. Throughout our lives others are “enabling” us to achieve our goals.<span>&nbsp; </span>As leaders, one of our primary responsibilities is to FOSTER COLLABORATION by building strong teams and to STRENGTHEN OTHERS by ensuring that they have the proper training, resources, etc. to be both competent and efficient. In addition, we have to encourage teamwork across the site between departments and functional groups.<span>&nbsp; </span>I believe that these “super teams” will truly set us apart from our competitors in driving efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>5. ENCOURAGE THE HEART<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>»<span> </span>SAFETY<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>»<span>&nbsp; </span>HONESTY<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>»<span>&nbsp; </span>CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT&nbsp;</strong><strong>»<span>&nbsp; </span>TEAMWORK </strong></p> <p>We must find opportunities to recognize others when they are behaving in ways that support and promote any or all of our core values. In fact, I believe that we do.<span>&nbsp; </span>I look at the GEM (Going the Extra Mile) recognition certificates I’ve received. And behind each one is a story of how an individual or team supported me by taking actions that promoted our values. By helping others “see” that recognition is firmly connected to all four of our Core Values we can reinforce those positive behaviors and together move closer and closer to our shared goals. </p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>Now it’s Your Turn…..</strong></p> <p>Connecting your organization’s mission, vision, or values to The Five Practices in a similar way may be a good exercise for your leadership team.<span>&nbsp; </span>You could use it as an opportunity to tell stories about significant events and experiences that your team has faced.<span>&nbsp; </span>Making it personal for them will reinforce their connection and make The Five Practices that much more meaningful. </p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>*Going the Extra Mile (GEM) is an internal peer-to-peer recognition program that is successfully building employee engagement, camaraderie and teamwork at Pasadena site. </p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Steve Skarke</strong> is a Certified Master-in-Training of The Leadership Challenge and Executive Vice President of Kaneka North America LLC.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p><strong>Be Self-aware</strong></p> <p>There’s solid evidence that the best leaders are highly attuned to what’s going on inside of them as they are leading. They’re very self-aware. They’re also quite aware of the impact they’re having on others. In fact, self-awareness may be the most crucial learning skill of all.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Think about it this way. Let’s say you begin to hear an odd sound every time you start your car. You ignore it, and pretty soon you don’t even notice it any more. You just keep on driving. Then one day your car won’t start at all. The mechanic tells you that it would have been a simple, inexpensive problem to fi x if you had paid attention when it first started, but because you ignored it for so long, it’s going to cost a bundle.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The same is true in leading. Self-awareness helps you receive clues about what’s going on inside you and in your environment. Your emotions are messages. They’re trying to teach you something. Don’t be afraid of them, and don’t become self-conscious about them. Just listen and learn. Take time to reflect on your experiences. Keep a journal of some kind, or record your thoughts and feelings on tape. As you go through your developmental experiences, look within yourself and pay attention to how you’re feeling.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Excerpted from the <em>Leadership Practices Inventory Planner, 4<sup>th</sup> edition</em>, James M.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>I just returned home from the 2012 Leadership Challenge Forum, celebrating the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of this extraordinary leadership model, along with the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of the book. Whether you were there or not, I thought you might appreciate a few personal reflections from the time with authors Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner, and the community of practitioners and supporters.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p> <p>1. Story telling was a key theme throughout the conference, with the focus less on technique and more on modeling the importance and impact. Stories are a powerful way of communicating lasting lessons and values. This caused me to think about the overwhelming amount of communication exchanged today in cryptic text or confusing email messages. In the attempt to be fast and efficient, maybe we are losing the meaning of many key messages. Maybe that contributes to “poor communication” perennially ranking atop the list of problems in organizations.</p> <p>2. The so called “back story” is important for context. This refers to parts of a story which the listener does not know about. I assume that there are always parts of another person’s life which contribute to his/her behavior in the moment. Starting a book at chapter five will leave one very confused, and so will interacting with new people without understanding some of their history. Remember the quote attributed to Henry Ford: “Why is it when I want to hire a pair of hands, I get a whole person.” Be willing to share your own and understand others’ back stories.</p> <p>3. Great leaders lead from a foundation of clear core values. As ordinary as this sounds, never forget its importance. Values help leaders understand the subtle differences between success and significance: success defined as being the best <strong><em>in</em></strong> the world, rather than being the best <strong><em>for</em></strong> the world. Knowing and acting on those kinds of differences are what lead to truly meaningful changes in the world. There is more to success than shareowner value or being number one on the <em>Global</em> <em>Fortune 500</em> list. Values are essential. Be clear on yours.</p> <p>4. Each year at the Forum, I meet more and more people whose names I have trouble pronouncing. That is because more and more people from countries far away–with unfamiliar names to me–are coming together to share important experiences and stories about the impact The Leadership Challenge model is continuing to have around the world. Very cool.</p> <p>5. One of the key differentiators of the work of Kouzes and Posner is their ongoing research. Every year they present more evidence that clearly demonstrates the direct relationships between The Five Practices and important outcomes such as higher performance and more positive work attitudes (or engagement levels). I appreciate their diligence in pursuing and finding the truth about the ways more effective leadership does make a real and measurable difference.</p> <p>6. My final reflection is that conferences such as these are usually very inspiring to those attending. I believe part of the reason is attendees let go—if only for a short while—some of the daily distractions to focus on a vision of more noble outcomes, such as renewed hope and promise, or how to really make a difference. I often wonder in our multi-tasking obsessed world, how often people actually do check out to reconnect with the purpose and meaning of their work – and lives. Who knows, maybe you do not have to be a Martin Luther King Jr. to inspire others. Maybe you just need to provide an environment that promotes and encourages people to take time to find and explore those uplifting connections for themselves.</p> <p><strong>Steve Coats</strong>, a Leadership Challenge® Certified Master, is a managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a leadership development education and consulting firm.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>We never quite know where inspiration will come from. Everywhere we look—in the workplace, in the classroom, among our friends and family—there are dozens of opportunities each and every day to see true, authentic leadership in action. And we know it when we see it! Remember your first professional mentor who generated such warmth, understanding, and compassion that you were inspired to reach above and beyond expectations? Or the outstanding teacher who willingly shared his intellect, resources, talents, and time—the one who set the example and inspired your passion for a career as an educator or trainer? Regardless of status or title, we can feel the self-confidence that genuine leaders exude; they know who they are, what they stand for, and are willing to step up and take the moral high ground. And that perception of self-confidence easily rubs off on us. </p> <p>At the same time we are looking outward to spot exemplary leadership practices and behaviors in others, we may be unaware of when we are the ones serving as an inspirational model to someone else. When we live our lives with authenticity, we don't necessarily think deliberately about what we're doing. We just <strong>do</strong> because it's the right thing for us. Our behaviors are natural—and genuine—and that's when others take notice. </p> <p>In the case of graduate student Donovan McFarlane, he found inspiration and motivation from his personal encounters with, among others, our own Barry Posner. And in a recently published article entitled <a href="http://www.leadingtoday.org/weleadinlearning/Winter2011/Article%203%20-%20Mcfarlane.pdf">"Impressed and Inspired"</a> he offers a reminder to us all that what we do makes a difference. Even if we aren't aware that anyone is paying attention, how we Model the Way matters. </p> <p><strong>Terri Armstrong Welch</strong> is an independent writer and editor contributing to the marketing and editorial programs at Pfeiffer, including The Leadership Challenge product line.

               <!-- July 2011 --> <p><strong>Q: There has been so much written about leadership. Do you think leaders are better as a result or are there still typical stumbling points or common mistakes that you see leaders make?</strong></p> <p><strong>A: </strong>The question of whether leaders are "better" is intriguing. Our entire careers have been devoted to developing better leaders and it can be humbling to look at how we've done over the years. For example, when we compare the most recent LPI scores to the average of five years ago, we see a very slight decline. Taken at face value, the numbers suggest that leadership may have gotten worse, or at least not gotten better. But the truth is that there is greater awareness and more sophistication about leadership. Constituents are now tougher graders; they're looking for even more effective leaders. And if that's the case, we could even say that leaders have actually improved. It's not unlike what's happened in sports—tennis, golf, track, team sports, and so on. We've raised the bar higher and expect more. We're tougher. And as a result, it's more difficult to attain higher levels of performance. </p> <p>And yes, there are a few common stumbling points for many striving to become the best leaders they can be. According to our data, inspiring a shared vision is an area in which leaders have the poorest performance. Of all of The Five Practices, consistently over time, that's been the most difficult for leaders to master—despite all the emphasis on how important it is for leaders to have and convey a vision. Leaders come up short in their ability to make their vision compelling to their constituents—to communicate it in such a way that other people want to join in and see that it's in their interests to further that vision. The way to enlist others is not through facts and figures. What we imagine or recall when we think about an exciting place or idea is the senses it evokes—the sights, smells, tastes, and feelings. That's what leaders need to communicate to Inspire a Shared Vision.</p> <p>The second weakness that the majority of leaders share is failing to ask others for feedback. It's an area in which people consistently score the lowest, both in their own opinions and in the opinion of others. And yet the most fundamental way to improve performance is by getting feedback on how we're doing. At some level, we're all uncomfortable with feedback. As leaders, we often don't ask for it until HR mandates a 360-degree assessment. And then we cringe before we receive that written report. The best leaders are the best learners, and they invite feedback. For some people, that's scary, but absolutely essential if we hope to improve our effectiveness as leaders.</p> <p><strong>Jim Kouzes</strong> is the Dean's Executive Fellow of Leadership, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University. <strong>Barry Posner</strong> is the Accolti Professor of Leadership at SCU's Leavey School of Business, where he served as Dean for 12 years.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> The U.S. Army has been developing leaders since the birth of our nation in 1776. And given the intense situations our soldiers often find themselves, leadership is critical. When there is a failure of leadership, the results are not just lost profits or economic disaster. It is the loss of lives. That's why an authoritarian leadership style often works best, especially under extreme duress and hardship. When orders are given, soldiers must respond—without question—because lives depend upon the speed of their response and how well they carry out orders. <p>More and more, however, the Army is finding that this authoritarian leadership style may not be completely effective in all circumstance and can actually impede the accomplishment of the mission. So, the question is: Is there a place for The Leadership Challenge model within the Army mindset of leader development? The answer, I believe, can be found in a recent study conducted at one of the Army's premier senior leader development institutions: the Army War College. </p> <p>In the study, subordinates of highly-regarded major generals in Iraq were asked to respond to the question, "What makes a good leader?" Listed below are the study subjects' responses, in order of importance. Consider how closely aligned these responses are to The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. </p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Keeps cool under pressure (Model the Way) </li> 
                <li>Clearly explains missions, standards, and priorities (Enable Others to Act) </li> 
                <li>Sees the big picture; provides context and perspective (Inspire a Shared Vision) </li> 
                <li>Makes tough, sound decisions on time (Model the Way) </li> 
                <li>Adapts quickly to new situations; can handle bad news (Challenge the Process; Enable Others to Act) </li> 
                <li>Gives useful feedback; sets a high ethical tone (Model The Way) </li> 
                <li>Is positive, encouraging, and realistically optimistic (Encourage the Heart) </li> 
               </ul> <p>The study's authors suggest that although technical and tactical competence are both necessary, those competencies are insufficient for long-term effectiveness as a leader. What is critical is developing interpersonal skills, along with technical and tactical competence. Interpersonal skills include developing credibility and building teams, in particular. The authors also state their belief that it is much easier to teach technical/tactical skills than it is to teach people how to gain trust (credibility) and build teams. Nonetheless, their message is unambiguous: in order to be a complete leader, developing what are often considered to be 'soft' skills are critically important to long-term leader success.</p> <p>It is apparent to me that The Five Practices are well suited to developing leaders in the U. S. Army. In fact, in workshops we conduct within the U.S. Army Medical Department we find that The Leadership Challenge model makes intuitive sense to the officers, non-commissioned officers, and government civilian employees alike. They can easily relate to how The Five Practices can be used to provide the leadership necessary for their people and organizations to succeed, regardless of whether they are providing healthcare services in a hospital or on the battlefield.</p> <p>Adapted from <em>What Makes a Good Leader?

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p><a name="nov2011"></a>It is easy to lead.....poorly. While leadership content is easy to understand, implementing leadership concepts can be extremely challenging and, unfortunately, too difficult for some. </p> <p>We all know leadership is hard—rewarding, but hard. However, leadership in a Third World country is more difficult than we can even imagine as part of the Western world. Issues caused by systemic poverty provide challenges at every turn. Lack of education, infrastructure, and empowerment can breed hopelessness and doubt that things can ever be different. </p> <p>But leadership springs up in unlikely places through unlikely people. It turns out you don't have to have a degree in Leadership Development to effect change in this world. You can grow up scavenging in the city's garbage dump and still find your voice and have a vision to change things. That's just what my friends, Yemamu Ahmed and Sisay Teni, have done. Since our first meeting in 2010, when I went to bring my adopted son home from Ethiopia, I have been impressed with their desire to make a difference in the lives of the people most vulnerable living in their community. When I returned recently to Ethiopia to spend two weeks with their organization, I was especially pleased to find The Five Practices very much alive and well.</p> <p>Yemamu and Sisay grew up in a leper colony called Korah (meaning "cursed"), which sits on a garbage dump in Ethiopia's capital city, Addis Ababa. Yemamu's mother has lost her leg and his father most of his eyesight due to leprosy. Sisay lost his father to the disease at a young age, leaving his widowed mother to care for him and his siblings with no means of income. In order to help sustain their families, Yemamu and Sisay spent their days and nights scavenging in the city's garbage dump for food or for metals and plastics they could sell for a small amount of money. They did this for years until someone sponsored them to go to school.</p> <p>Now, they are giving back to the community they grew up in. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Where does one start to effect change when looking at a 100,000 person community that is barely surviving, whose members have been labeled as outcasts in their society: the poor, those living with HIV, the uneducated, diseased, and homeless? How do you Inspire a Shared Vision when no one wants to be inspired or feels there's nothing to be inspired about? In the case of Yemamu and Sisay, you Model the Way until people catch the vision and see the potential for change. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Yemamu knew what it was like to be hungry. And having identified the need, he put together a business plan for a center that would feed some of the most vulnerable children in Korah and applied for a NGO (non-government organization) status. He knew that hunger impacted so many other facets of a child's life. A hungry child is often weak and tired, making it extremely difficult to focus on school and learning. For children who are HIV+, it is crucial that their ARV drugs are taken with food in order for their bodies to absorb the medication. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As Yemamu began to seek out children who met the criteria for the program, he started where for him it all began: back at the garbage dump.</p> <p><img alt="" src="http://media.wiley.com/assets/5031/42/Ethiopia_175.gif"> </p> <p>From the start, Yemamu established credibility with the children by seeking them out, coming to them in a place where no one else wanted to go—the 'messy' places of leadership, so to speak. Because of Yemamu's years at the garbage dump, they responded to him and willingly came with us to the Center to be registered for the program. Since then, others have accompanied Yemamu, to visit the children and create relationships with them. And as Yemamu and Sisay have invested in people and exposed them to the vision, they have become engaged, willing participants in changing the future for these children. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the things I've always loved about The Five Practices model is how interconnected each of the practices are. When one is implemented, there seems to be a natural progression into the others. For example, as Yemamu began to truly Encourage the Hearts of the people he wanted to lead and to Modeled the Way for them, his actions inspired others to believe that the vision of improving the community was possible. And once they saw the possibility, Yemamu could Enable Others to Act. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Others became engaged once they received encouragement from Yemamu. It all started there. People wanted to know that they were cared about. One striking example of what I observed was Yemamu's relationship with one particular family. We met a mother with five children who had recently lost her husband—a blind man who earned money begging on the streets to feed his family. Over a year ago, her 17-year-old daughter, Etanaite, was raped and bore a child as a result. Due to the stigma associated with rape in this area of Ethiopia, the entire family was outcast. No one spoke to them, helped them, or cared about them. Having heard of this family's struggles, Yemamu went to meet them to see if he could help (there it is...Encouraging the Heart). The family was incredulous that anyone would be concerned about their well-being. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When I accompanied Yemamu on a visit to the family, their living conditions were unimaginable. Seven people lived in a 6' x 8' room, with one single make-shift bed.</p> <p><img alt="" src="http://media.wiley.com/assets/5031/43/Ethiopia_225.gif"> </p> <p>The baby was drinking out of a bottle that had been found in the garbage dump. The mother was wearing rags. And the now 18-year-old Etanaite was commuting daily to work in the countryside earning $26 a month—half of which went toward her long transportation to work. The rest of her income paid the rent. Nothing was left for food. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Yemamu and Sisay continued to visit the family. They enrolled the children in the feeding program and helped Etanaite see that despite the tragedy of her rape, there was reason to hope. She truly could have a future. They offered her a job cooking and cleaning at the Center, paying her twice what she was making before. Etanaite now can provide more for her family and contribute in a meaningful way by giving back to her own community. And her mother will no longer have to go scavenging in the garbage dump to make ends meet. Yemamu and Sisay gave Etanaite an opportunity for work that will literally transform her life and the lives of her family members. They also gave her something else: they fully engaged her in the possibilities for the future and enabled her to act. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In just two short weeks in Ethiopia, there were hundreds of examples of The Five Practices in action. Maybe not in the traditional business settings we are accustomed to but, rather, in the city garbage dump, the small homes of the socially outcast, and on the streets of Addis Ababa. It was a privilege to watch the humility with which Yemamu and Sisay led the people in their community toward hope. Children's very livelihoods and futures are being forever changed because two young men are willing to go where no one wants to go and to do the hard work of helping people see that there is another way—that poverty does not have to define them.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p><a name="apr2011"></a>It is easy to lead.....poorly. While leadership content is easy to understand, implementing leadership concepts can be extremely challenging and, unfortunately, too difficult for some. </p> <p>Becoming an effective, if not <em>great</em>, leader takes focus, a well thought-out plan, and determination. It requires a strong foundation of self-knowledge—e.g., personal values, principles, vision, and goals—and a clear understanding of one's strengths and weaknesses in addition to a solid understanding of one's emotional intelligence. </p> <p>As important as the leader's foundation is, creating or strengthening it isn't that difficult. It starts with asking a few critical questions, engaging in introspection, and through consistent feedback. When facilitating or coaching leaders wishing to enhance their skills, I always start by asking them to take several days to answer: Who am I?, Who are you?, and Who are we? Answers to these basic yet powerful questions will go a long way to solidify a leader's foundation. </p> <p>The importance of answering the first question, "Who Am I?", cannot be overstated. Without a clear understanding of who the leader is, future leadership effectiveness is often short-lived and superficial; the ability to accomplish great goals will be severely weakened. Do you know your passions? Your vision, values, and beliefs? Your level of compassion for the organization and mission? How much are you willing to sacrifice for the organization? Answering these questions helps leaders understand their future role and the potential difference they can make.</p> <p>The recent edition of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ltl.v2011.60/issuetoc">Leader to Leader</a> magazine (Spring 2011) reinforces the importance of self-discovery and introspection in developing our effectiveness as leaders. Included are two articles: one written by Richard Daft, the other by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner that addresses the importance of leader authenticity. Both articles focus on the importance of knowing yourself and advocate for one of Jim and Barry's key tenets of leadership development: one's leadership journey starts with an inner journey. </p> <p>The second question aspiring leaders must ask is, "Who are you?". Once leaders have a solid understanding of who they are and what they plan to contribute in their leadership role, they must turn to understanding those they are leading. The most effective leaders know their people intimately, not superficially. They remember names—including those of family members. They learn what their colleagues' goals and desires are. They understand everyone's roles, and they work hard to ensure everyone knows the importance of their contribution to the organization. While it is often not advised to become friends with those we lead, a leader must always strive to be friendly with co-workers, direct reports, and all others with whom they work. Being "friendly" means getting to know people and working to support the dreams and aspirations of others.</p> <p>The third and all-important question is, "Who are we?" Once we know who we are and who our colleagues are, as effective leaders we must begin the process of creating a team capable of meeting and/or exceeding job requirements. Leaders must see where everyone fits to form a highly functioning team that together accomplishes far more than what anyone could do individually. Creating such a team requires a leader who clearly articulates a vision, helps everyone understand their role, demonstrates what it will take to do the job well, ensures that all team members know how they will be held accountable, and determines how the team will be recognized and rewarded when the mission is accomplished. Team members who know their work matters and that their leader appreciates their contributions will work harder and longer than someone who thinks their contributions are not appreciated or valued. Having a clear understanding of and the ability to use The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® (Model The Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge The Process, Enable Others to Act, Encourage The Heart) is critical to defining "Who We Are." </p> <p><strong>Jody R.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Whether your organization has less than ten employees or more than ten thousand, never underestimate the importance of trust. Trust is the true hallmark of healthy relationships inside and outside of the business world. Trust can be examined at the micro level—in how employees trust their immediate leader—or at the macro level in how employees trust the organizations they work for. In either case, trust plays a powerful role. Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner's research tells us that trustworthiness, expertise, and dynamism are crucial to establishing what they call source credibility and, ultimately, that credibility is the foundation of leadership. Simply stated, without trust there is a lack of leadership credibility.</p> <p><strong>What can leaders do to build more trust with others?</strong></p> <p>The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines trust as "assured reliance on the character, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something." The Great Places to Work Institute has determined that for leaders and organizations to build trust and inspire performance, leaders must focus on the elements that build credibility: communication, competence, and integrity. Sound familiar? These elements are closely aligned with Jim and Barry's findings related to source credibility. </p> <p>Take a moment to answer these questions: </p> 
               <ol> 
                <li>Do you consistently ensure that all communication is open, honest, accessible, and constructive? </li> 
                <li>Do you proactively use your background and expertise to explore solutions to both small and large problems? </li> 
                <li>Do you follow through with your commitments and promises? (Remember, DWYSYWD*!) </li> 
               </ol> <p>If you answered yes to all three questions, you have leadership credibility. But, how do you establish leadership credibility on a bigger scale? </p> <p>Meridian Health, a large health care system in Central New Jersey with more than 11,000 employees, continually focuses on sustaining themselves as a workplace of choice. This organization has been recognized as a Best Places to Work in New Jersey for seven years in a row, and a Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For in America for 2010 and 2011. The Gallup Organization has also measured Meridian's employee engagement as world class. How do they do it? Meridian Health takes leadership seriously. They have an organizational culture that is—by design—well-defined, clear to all, and goal oriented. It is called The Meridian Way. </p> <p>Meridian Health's formula for success aligns leadership excellence, team member excellence, and service excellence together, which equates to a strong organization that pays significant attention to the selection, training, communication, and care of its employees. These efforts do not go unnoticed by employees and, in fact, aid in developing trusting relationships between employees and their leaders.</p> <p>Through either lens—small or large—credible leadership is built on trust. The true measure of trust is reflected in many ways, such as employee retention, employee engagement, or customer satisfaction. As we continue on our own leadership journey in this ever-changing, fast-paced world, becoming a credible leader who is capable of creating a culture of excellence starts with the often simple, positive, thoughtful behaviors that promote trust: providing open and honest communication and feedback, being willing to share our expertise, and following through on our commitments.</p> <p>* DWYSYWD = Do What You Will Say You Will Do — An acronym discussed in The Leadership Challenge® Workshop.</p> <p><strong>Patrice Ventura</strong> is a Certified Facilitator of The Leadership Challenge® Workshop and director of the Meridian Leadership Institute, a consulting firm that provides dynamic, experiential training and coaching programs to grow leaders and teams throughout organizations.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> Check this out. In one five-day period, the following four major stories were covered in my local newspaper. 
               <ul> 
                <li>a local flagship company was being fined millions of dollars for price fixing </li> 
                <li>the role model coach of a football powerhouse was being fined and suspended for NCAA violations </li> 
                <li>a well-known former county commissioner pled guilty to fraud and other offenses </li> 
                <li>teachers were virtually giving answers to students in order to boost standardized test scores </li> 
               </ul> <p>Notice anything common about these examples? That's correct, they all represent stepping over the line in some fashion. </p> <p>Unfortunately, you do not have to look very hard to find other similar examples, as they are very prevalent. I do wonder how much the depressed economy during the past couple of years has exacerbated the issue, at least in business. </p> <p>The topic of cutting corners is getting a lot of attention these days, and those articles got me thinking about it even more deeply. My main question is whether or not people are becoming more lax in their standards about what constitutes cutting a corner. I have heard people passionately argue that one should never cut corners of any kind, even during tough times. Others attempt to build a convincing case that there are circumstances which make it acceptable. A great deal of this lively debate occurs with little time spent defining what cutting a corner actually means. </p> <p>Apparently it can be any kind of deviation from an established process to a major lapse in values or ethics. Regardless, there are strong opinions on whether cutting corners is ever justifiable. </p> <p>Where are you on this issue? Do you have a clear sense of what it truly means to cut corners?</p> <p><strong>Factors for Consideration</strong></p> <p>There are a number of factors most prominent in these discussions. One of them is the dialogue about the reason for even considering it. There are those who take the position that the means (of cutting corners) often do justify the ends of a greater good. For example, might it be acceptable to slightly fudge some non-essential data in the FDA approval process in order to get a phenomenal new cancer drug to the market quicker? Would it be OK to turn a bit of a blind eye toward the regulations, if the "less valid" information has nothing to do with the drug's effectiveness or side effects, but is more bureaucratic in nature? Would that really be dishonest? </p> <p>What do you think? Would your judgment change if it was you or a loved one who needed the drug, and needed it right now, in order to survive?</p> <p><em>What does cutting a corner really mean? Does it always imply stepping onto a slippery slope?</em> </p> <p>One controversial matter worth mentioning about this factor is, who decides what is the greater good? Short cutting a regulation to rescue people from a life-threatening disaster is one thing. But are next quarter's profits a worthy enough end to jeopardize a value of quality or safety? Would you be willing to postpone required aircraft maintenance if you needed to reduce costs—in order to keep your job, when unemployment is running out of control? </p> <p>There is no doubt that many reasons can cause people to cross the line. Survival in tough times, for individuals and corporations, may certainly be one of them. </p> <p>Unfortunately, so is the drive to satisfy more selfish interests. The real question to address is, are there any valid reasons? </p> <p>Consistency (or lack thereof) of rules or regulations is another factor that has contributed to some spirited debate regarding cutting corners. Consider this purely fictional example. Imagine you operate in-store medical clinics in grocery stores. You have operations throughout the Kansas City area. Let's assume that Missouri law requires a licensed physician to be on the premises at all times, but Kansas law requires only a physician assistant. Let's go even further and say that there are two clinics which are virtually right across the street from each other, and the street happens to be State Line Road. </p> <p>You are the manager that operates these two clinics, and one day your physician staff gets strained and there is no available doctor for this particular Missouri clinic. Do you take a chance and open the door anyway? After all, it is perfectly fine to do that in the store 300 feet to the west. What if there is a terrible outbreak of the flu, and the Kansas clinic is already overflowing? Would you deny people who need the care, especially when your staff of PAs and nurses can do the job?</p> <p>Do you see how one could easily make a case for violating this perceived "silly" restriction which is obviously more politically than medically driven? Come on, the legal corner you would be cutting is a non-issue, a football field away. Why should you be penalized because of inconsistent government? Actually, it is not hard to imagine how the decision to open the clinic could be rationalized, is it? </p> <p><strong>What Are the Consequences</strong></p> <p>One final factor, which is virtually always in the forefront of the corner cutting discussion, is the need to intensely evaluate all of the consequences of your actions, even if it seems the corner is very minor. Never forget the impact of cutting what may have appeared to be an insignificant corner on the USS Forrestal, where one small deviation in the missile firing sequence resulted in 134 crewmen losing their lives, along with millions of dollars of damage to the ship. </p> <p>Might cutting corners on quality to meet a shipment deadline result in dissatisfied or lost customers? How about intentionally reporting positive study findings on research which was never done? There are always consequences, regardless of how noble the cause may appear to be. </p> <p>The world is full of slippery slopes and leaders must be thoughtfully vigilant about actions which will bump up against their lines in the sand. This is why it is so important for leaders to be clear on their values and principles, as these help define and reinforce those lines in the sand. </p> <p>Leaders need something they can count on to guide them in making very difficult decisions. And often the most difficult decisions, where corner-cutting is considered, are matters that directly confront or conflict with values. </p> <p>Think about how you might respond in the following situations. Would you be willing to risk paying a fine for opening your clinic doors, in the earlier example, to reduce human suffering? Would you be willing to immediately deploy critical resources to a natural or man-made disaster, if you are a government agency or contractor that is prohibited from incurring any kind of cost without prior budget approval? Would you conveniently overlook an under-aged worker in an overseas plant, if this job was the sole means of support for her family? These could all be perceived as examples of cutting a corner.</p> <p><strong>What Does This Mean</strong></p> <p>Leaders face dilemmas such as these every single day. Let me just say it is much easier to write about them than to deal with them. Likewise, it is easier to simply talk about the high road than it is to actually take it.</p> <p>So what does this tell you about the right or wrong of cutting corners? First be aware that this decision is different than choosing between several potential right answers. Whether bumping up against company policies, social values or ethics, or even a broader legal system, corner cutting decisions are frequently between something right and something else acknowledged to be wrong. Although an objective risk-reward analysis might point you toward stepping over the line, know that there will usually be unintended or unexpected consequences. Something other than a better bottom line might be at stake.</p> <p>Next, be especially mindful about the size or scope of the corner in question. One could easily get the impression that is never OK to cut a big corner, but a little one—well, how bad could that really be? And given the fact that no one will likely ever know anyway, what's the big deal? Can you visualize this conversation? Have you ever been part of one? It is not wise to let size, by itself, determine the decision.</p> <p>Finally, cutting a corner is different than streamlining a process, although some may not see much difference. Most businesspeople with whom I have worked are quick to point out how important it is to continually improve processes, by eliminating redundant steps which add no value. Achieving a big goal in a tight timeframe sometimes requires one to create new processes. Success and growth requires new and innovative ways of getting things done.</p> <p>So, continue to challenge, examine, test and experiment with new ways of operating and adding value for your customers, associates and others. And if it feels like corner cutting, get a variety of perspectives and opinions on your options. This will contribute to more thoughtful deliberation about reasons and consequences, and will give everyone involved a moment to reflect on the actions you are considering.</p> <p>But think very carefully when considering sidestepping the laws of the land, ignoring your own company or external regulations, or compromising, even ever-so-slightly, the values you preach as un-compromisable. You may find just how quickly that slippery slope will take you to a place you really do not want to be.<br> © Steven C. Coats</p> <p><strong>Steven C.

               <!-- March 2011 --> <p><strong>Q: It's fine to live out our values in good times, when business is up. But how do you maintain the focus on values in tough times, when financial results become the most important thing? </strong></p> <p><strong>A: </strong>If you look at the business scandals that make the headlines, you'll find case after case of profits trumping ethical behavior. Look a bit deeper, however, and you'll find the financial consequences of these actions turned out to be disastrous—for investors and employees. A focus on profits at the expense of doing the right thing is a sure way to economic decline. </p> <p>Of course, there are times when leaders have to make tough decisions about layoffs. But it's important to remember that only the most credible leaders can make these kinds of tough decisions and sustain credibility. You have to build your credibility over time so that when you do have to make the tough decision, you can say, "You'll have to trust me on this one." You have to accumulate and invest capital before you can withdraw. That's what's called "having a good credit rating." </p> <p>In fact, it is precisely in tough times when we most need to focus consciously on values, because it is so easy to cut corners to make the numbers. For a manager, making the numbers might be enough, but financial success is not enough for a leader. A leader must also ensure the organization will survive over the longer term, even after a downturn. A company's reputation is tested in tough times. The winners never compromise their values. Instead, they discover innovative ways to prosper. </p> <p><strong>Jim Kouzes</strong>, cited by <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>as one of the twelve best executive educators in the U.S., is the Dean's Executive Professor of Leadership, Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p><a name="mar2011"></a>It is encouraging to come across people who are enthused about the subject of leadership and are seeking to improve their capabilities as a leader. With overwhelming schedules, many don't want to over-commit so they will proclaim their intention with something safe like, "I just want to be a better leader tomorrow than I am today." They might even go so far as to acknowledge the skills or behaviors they are committed to working on. Sounds promising, doesn't it? </p> <p>Yet, we all know how much harder it is to develop ourselves than it is to merely utter a profound statement of intention. As one who is devoted to helping others make progress as leaders, I like to follow up such clichéd pronouncements with my favorite question: "Tell me one thing you have done today that has made you better as a leader than you were yesterday." As you might expect, the most common response is a blank stare.</p> <p>It takes more than reciting an aspirational goals to get better. While it's easy to talk about development and the need for small, even daily, improvements, it's just not so easy to follow through. Nietzsche once wrote, "The most common sort of lie is the one uttered to oneself." Have you ever tried to trick yourself and others into thinking that you are taking steps to grow, when you know deep down all you are really doing is talking about it? My hand is raised.</p> <p>I like to suggest to others a simple and memorable little model: Plan, Practice, Polish and Perform. (Ah yes, another clever series of words that all begin with the same letter!) Use whatever words you like, but here are a few key things to remember: </p> <p>Getting better at anything takes practice. It is through practice that you test, tinker, make mistakes, learn and, ultimately, polish your skills. This ongoing practicing and polishing equips you to perform at your best when called upon to do so.</p> <p>Don't forget, however, that practice seldom occurs unless you plan it. You likely have too many things on your plate today, so you must make a commitment to set aside specific time — and honor that commitment — if you expect to follow through. From taking music lessons or playing sports as a kid, you know that if the practice times had not been set up in advance, something else would have squeezed them out. Unless you plan, you will find your daily life feels like an endless series of interruptions, all of which are high priority. And we wonder why so many of us feel overwhelmed!</p> <p>So, if you want to be better tomorrow than today start working on it right now. Plan how you can continually make progress. Then follow through on what you can do to turn boring meetings into productive planning sessions, listen more carefully to the "hard to express" needs of individuals, constantly clarify your messages so they are better understood, and improve in the many other areas in which followers and colleagues are counting on your leadership. </p> <p>That trusted friend DWYSYWD (do what you say you will do) will serve you well. Don't let well-intentioned words be a substitute for the real work that needs to be done.</p> <p><strong>Steve Coats</strong>, a Leadership Challenge® Certified Master, is a managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a leadership development education and consulting firm.

               <!-- January 2011 --> <p><strong>Q: I don't consider myself a very imaginative person, so how can I be a better idea-generator? </strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Many leaders struggle with feelings similar to yours, feeling that others are so much more creative and innovative than they are. But in reality, studies show that leaders are not necessarily any more or less creative, imaginative, insightful-or intelligent, for that matter-than any other group of people. What leaders do excel at is what my co-author, Barry Posner, and I call 'outsight'. This is the ability to look outside of yourself and your experiences. So I have a couple of suggestions for you: </p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Try looking in what may seem like strange places-places you would never expect to find fresh ideas and others who may have insight you never considered. </li> 
                <li>Listen to people who are not like you and who have had experiences that you have never had. </li> 
                <li>Take advantage of all of the ideas that already exist-out among your colleagues, your manager, your direct reports, and your professional or industry peers. </li> 
               </ul> <p>Gather together whatever you can find, sifting through the lot until you find one or adapt one to fit your particular challenges and opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Jim Kouzes</strong> cited by The Wall Street Journal as one of the twelve best executive educators in the U.S., is the Dean's Executive Professor of Leadership, Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University.

               <!-- October 2010 --> <p><strong>Q: I realize recognition is important to keep my staff motivated, but can it be overdone? I see other department heads coming up with all kinds of "rewards" programs that, frankly, just look plain silly to me. And I'm not sure they even work! </strong></p> <p><strong>A: </strong>Certainly recognition can be overdone, even made trivial. However, there really is no denying that the need to be 'recognized' is essential to all of us. While every leader has his or her own approach to acknowledging the work of others—whether direct reports, colleagues, or teammates—the important thing to remember is that the recognition you offer needs to be genuine, sincere, and comfortable for you as the 'giver' of praise. It also must be personal and meaningful to the recipient. No silly "rewards" programs if that doesn't fit who you are and what your direct reports find important. However, the fact remains that the need to be recognized for who we are is part of our basic human nature. </p> <p>Do others NEED praise and encouragement to do their work? No, probably not. But in research that Barry and I have conducted, when we asked respondents, "When you get encouragement, does it help you perform at a higher level?" about 98 percent said yes. Consider that against other research that reports about one-third of North American workers who say they <em>never </em>are recognized for a job well done while slightly more (44 percent) report that they receive little recognition for a job well done. Only 50 percent of managers say they give recognition for high performance. If you are working in an industry (which is nearly every industry these days) where loyal talent can mean the difference between staying viable through good times and bad, this could represent a powerful competitive advantage for you to positively impact your organization's bottom line. </p> <p>Whatever approach you take to acknowledging others, keep a lookout for actions to recognize. Make it a habit to show your appreciation at least twice a day to two different people. Chances are you'll never hear complaints of being thanked too much.</p> <p><strong>Jim Kouzes</strong> is the Dean's Executive Professor of Leadership, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University.

               <!--<p><a name="dec2010"></a>December 2010: by Mary Cooper</strong></p> --> <p>Leaders today are facing the most complicated workforce in history. For the first time, four generations are working side-by-side, each at different life stages and each with conflicting needs. The members of each group have largely been shaped by the social and economic events that occurred during their lifetimes. And when it comes to jobs and leaders, each group comes to the workplace with different perspectives and expectations.</p> <p>Adding to the complexity that a generationally diverse workforce creates is the rapid growth of ethnic and cultural workers in America. Leaders today are discovering that they must learn new skills: strong human relations, communications, and diversity skills and knowledge are essential. They must know how to motivate and inspire in order to get work done and create success for the organization, for themselves, and for their team.</p> <p>Leading within this complex environment can be challenging and rewarding, with plenty of opportunity to capitalize on diverse ideas and work styles that bring innovation to the organization. To succeed, great leaders will need to learn to tap into the resources of this multigenerational and multicultural workforce, handle misunderstandings and misperceptions effectively, and leverage the varied talents and worldviews of each and every employee.</p> <p>While there may be all types of differences in needs, perspectives, and expectations—between and among generations and cultures—there are several strategies that flow from The Five Practices model that leaders can employ. Together, these approaches can help create an environment that will engage employees, enhance their talents, and maximize productivity:</p> 
               <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1"> 
                <li><strong>Treat others with respect. </strong>&nbsp;Whether differences are social, economic, generational, cultural, religious, life and work experience, or lifestyle, think of each person as a first-edition, collectible book. We must treat each with respect as it is only when we get to know who is inside—beyond the cover—that we can truly understand and appreciate every one for the unique individuals they are. </li> 
                <li><strong>Make it easy for others to express their ideas.</strong> Doris Kearns Goodwin said "Good leadership requires you to surround yourself with people of diverse perspectives who can disagree with you without fear of retaliation." Following Ms. Goodwin's advice, we must create an environment where people feel comfortable sharing their suggestions and concerns and where healthy disagreement can occur. Involve employees, ask their opinion, and take into consideration the generational and cultural characteristics and traits that may inhibit employees from expressing their ideas. Solicit ideas in different ways because some of us are comfortable speaking in groups while others prefer speaking one-on-one. </li> 
                <li><strong>Commit to ongoing growth.</strong> Growth may be developing a new skill, advancing in a career, or speaking a second language. Leaders must provide employees with the tools and resources necessary not only to perform specific job tasks, but to develop competence and confidence in order to maximize each person's potential. This can be done through formal training, buddy systems, cross-training and mentoring. </li> 
                <li><strong>Give credit and recognize.</strong> William James once said "The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated." We all like to be told that our efforts and accomplishments are valued. And recognition doesn't have to be expensive. In fact, think about some of the most meaningful recognition you have ever received and you will realize that it probably didn't cost much. However, it was no doubt personal, specific, relevant, timely, and sincere. It also probably honored your preference for being recognized in public or in private. </li> 
                <li><strong>Develop strong communication skills.</strong> Leaders must clearly articulate the standards of performance, the rules or parameters of the company culture, and the 'why' behind policies and procedures. Be open and honest in your communication with others and provide information in a timely manner. Be direct and respectful in holding everyone accountable for performance and behaviors, giving specific feedback on what necessary changes and improvements you determine need to be made. Most important, and often overlooked, improve your ability to be a good listener. Keen listening is the way to get to know people as individuals, rather than by title or category.&nbsp; Remember: diversity is multi-dimensional, so even the same generation or culture is expressed uniquely by each of us. </li> 
               </ol> <p>Keep in mind that the best strategy for leading others—whether employees, peers, or volunteers—is <em>to know each person as an individual!</em> Avoid stereotyping and making assumptions. Leadership is all about relationships. The deeper your relationship, the more effective you will be at knowing how to communicate, coach, motivate, challenge, and guide every individual to be the best they can be. </p> <p><strong>Mary Cooper</strong> is a Certified Master of The Leadership Challenge® and president of Engaging Outcomes, an Orlando-based training and consulting firm focused on guiding leaders and organizations in leaving a legacy.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>While many baby-boom leaders are frustrated with the disconnect between generations, organizations across the spectrum also deny access to social networking sites. In fact, according to a recent study conducted by Robert Half Technology that surveyed 1,400 CIOs in U.S. businesses, 54% reported that their organizations block the use of social media such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter within the workplace. Yet our success as leaders depends on our ability to have profound conversations with constituents. And in today's web-connected world, that means taking advantage of the technological and social media tools available — to meet and connect, in particular, with members of the younger generation who prefer to communicate and learn in open environments.</p> <p>So the important questions to leaders: Are you using online social media in your role as a leader to create an environment of openness and transparency? Have you practiced your leadership skills through a range of different media?</p> <p>An essential starting place for social media novices or anyone wanting to build relationships with constituents in our new open environment is to profile your constituents' social computing behaviors using <a href="http://sonomaleadership.com/blog/bid/40577/leaders-Do-you-Grok-Blog">The Social Technology Profile Tool</a>. This tool automatically creates a profile of your selected demographic group. It tests both your organization's voice and your constituent's receptivity to your voice (i.e., their willingness to listen to you and respond to you as credible).*</p> <p>An additional approach is to follow the advice of Charlene Li, author of <a href="http://www.wiley.com/buy/0470597267"><em>Open Leadership</em></a>, who suggests that our focus as leaders must shift from trying to retain what little control we actually have to choosing where and when we will be open to embrace our newly- empowered employees. <a href="http://www.charleneli.com/resources/">The Openness Audit</a> asks you to rate how open your organization is in each of six different information- sharing elements. This diagnostic tool will help you understand where your organization is open and where it is not. In particular, the results assess the level of openness that exists in structure, encouragement, and exhibited behavior that can help define a plan to open your organization to becoming more flexible and responsive utilizing the technology and social media tools available.</p> <p>References: &nbsp;<em>Groundswell: Winning in a World Transformed by Social Technologies</em>, by Charlene Li and Josh Bernoff; <em>Open Leadership</em>:<em> How Social Technology Can Transform the Way You Lead</em>, by Charlene Li.</p> <p><strong>Jeni Nichols</strong> is Queen of Connections at Sonoma Leadership Systems, a leading provider of The Leadership Challenge® Workshop, training and materials, that also provides a dynamic range of integrated training programs, coaching, courseware, e-learning solutions, and implementation tools designed to inspire and develop exemplary leaders and teams at every level.

               <!--<a name="sept2010"></a>September 2010: By James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner--> <p>We shared the platform with renowned leadership educator Ken Blanchard at an association meeting. In the middle of responding to an audience question one of us was saying, "I don't know what you call something that's been the same for twenty-five years, but...," and Ken interrupted, exclaiming, "I'd call it the truth."</p> <p>It was a moment of clarity. We began to see that we shouldn't be shy about saying that some things about leadership just don't change that much over time, if at all, and that those things need to be understood for what they are—<em>the truth. </em></p> <p>While context changes, while global and personal circumstances change, the fundamentals of leadership do not. We thought it was just as important in these changing times to remind people of what endures as it was to talk about what has been disrupted.</p> <p>We wanted to make certain that the lessons we included not only withstood the test of time but also withstood the scrutiny of statistics. So we sifted through the reams of data that had piled up over three decades and isolated those nuggets that were soundly supported by the numbers. This is a collection of the real thing—no fads, no myths, no trendy responses—just truths that endure.</p> <p>This book reveals the most important things that we've learned since we began our collaboration. It's a collection of fundamental principles that inform and support the practices of leadership. These are lessons that were true thirty years ago, are true today, and we believe will be true thirty years from now. They speak to what the newest and youngest leaders need to appreciate and understand, and they speak just as meaningfully to the oldest leaders, who are perhaps re-purposing themselves as they transition from their lengthy careers to other pursuits in volunteer, community, or public sectors. Entrepreneurs need to appreciate what we have learned, just as do people leading established enterprises.</p> <p>These lessons ring true on athletic fields and in the halls of government, and they make as much sense in the United States, China, Brazil, the European Union, India, or any other global address that you can imagine.</p> <p>This isn't a "<em>How To</em>" or "<em>Made Easy</em>" or "<em>For Dummies</em>" approach to leadership—it is a book about fundamentals. And fundamentals are the necessary building blocks to greatness. You can't fast-track your way to excellence. Leadership is a demanding, noble discipline not to be entered into frivolously or casually. It requires an elevated sense of mastery. And, you can do it. It's a matter of technique, of skill, of practice. It's also a matter of desire and commitment.</p> <p>There are <em>enduring </em>truths about leadership. You can gain mastery over the art and science of leadership by understanding them and attending to them in your workplace and everyday life.</p> <p>Excerpted from <a href="http://www.wiley.com/buy/0470633549"><em>The Truth About Leadership</em></a>, James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner, Jossey-Bass Publishers, August 2010</p>

               <!--July 2010: Inspire a Shared Vision by Jeni Nichols--> <p>What are the key skills that leaders need to develop to survive in the future? Bob Johansen of the Institute for the Future (IFTF)—an independent, nonprofit think tank—believes that in a world of increasing volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (what he calls VUCA), leaders must learn new skills in order to make a better future. And key among those new skills, Johansen identifies, is the ability to "see through messes and contradictions" to a future that others cannot yet see.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>As we know from Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner, leadership is about encouraging and inspiring others to envision the future by "painting a picture" of exciting possibilities. People don't often admit that they are an artist or extremely creative. Yet, these talents are demonstrated by highly effective leaders in their every day activities when they see through messes and contradictions, painting a picture that excites and inspires.</p> <p>Another key skill of the future leader that Johansen identifies is "commons creating": the ability to stimulate, grow, and nurture shared assets that can benefit other players. Looking at Johansen's notion of "commons creating" though the lens of The Five Practices model, we see Enabling Others to Act. In the future, leaders will need to develop competence, build confidence, and invest in strengthening the capacity of individuals and organizations-more than ever before—even though Enabling Others to Act may look a bit different for future leaders because of the tools available. As leaders, we can create social change networks, organize smart mobs, and use our advanced electronic and media tools to foster collaboration and strengthen others.</p> <p>No matter how we paint pictures or create commons, as leaders we need to be more overt: let our constituents see and benefit from these skills. For example, when interviewing past participants of The Leadership Challenge® Workshop, we asked how they were influenced by The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. One leader, remarking on the practice, Inspire a Shared Vision, replied "It wasn't so much that I didn't have leadership qualities. It was that I wasn't putting them out there for others to see." She realized that "It's really about what's inside of you and people follow you because you exhibit those qualities that they feel are 'follow-able'."</p> <p>For more insight from interviewees, visit <a href="http://sonomaleadership.com/about/client-results/" target="_blank">http://sonomaleadership.com/about/client-results/</a>. Hear more about the ways in which leaders are using the model of The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® to paint pictures, see through messes, and create commons.</p> <p><sup>1</sup>Adapted from <em>Leaders Make the Future: Ten New Leadership Skills for an Uncertain World</em> (2009), Bob Johansen</p> <p><strong>Jeni Nichols</strong> is Queen of Connections at Sonoma Leadership Systems, a leading provider of The Leadership Challenge® Workshop, training, and materials.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>This probably doesn't come as any surprise to you, but here's the rub. Organizations these days seem to want us to develop leaders in shorter and shorter periods of time. It's all part of the trend of instant success. Well, guess what? It isn't going to happen. There's no such thing as instant leadership—or instant expertise of any kind. There's no fast track to excellence. Those who are the very best at anything got to be that way because they spent more time learning and practicing, not less time learning.</p> <p>According to the experts on expertise—people like researcher K. Anders Ericsson, Conradi Eminent Scholar at Florida State University—what truly differentiates the expert performers from the good performers is hours of practice. You've got to work at becoming the best, and it sure doesn't happen over a weekend. If you want a rough metric of what it'll take to achieve the highest level of expertise, the estimate is about 10,000 hours of practice over a period of ten years. That's about 2.7 hours a day, every day for ten years. So the next time someone says the organization ought to cut leadership development back to a couple days a year, show them that number and then ask them whether they would rather have professionals or amateurs running the business.</p> <p>The Leadership Challenge® Workshop is intended to be, in essence, a multi-day practice opportunity. People spend sixteen hours engaged in an intensive, designed learning experience that accesses all styles. There are opportunities to read about and hear presentations on key concepts, chances to actively experiment with the practices, occasions to observe role models, times to reflect on experiences and observations, and places for dialogue with peers. It's this combination of approaches that makes this workshop unique.</p> <p>But attending a workshop is obviously not all there is to learning to lead. In fact, if learning stops at the classroom door, then we can guarantee that there will be little change in behavior back home. Remember, it takes 2.7 hours of practices per day to become the best, not just those hours in the workshop. There is a process built into The Leadership Challenge® Workshop for continuing the learning back on the job, but it's only a beginning. Leadership development is an ongoing process that must continue if you are to become the best leader you can be. The real change begins when we turn our workplaces into practice fields for leadership.</p> <p>Excerpted from <a href="http://www.wiley.com/buy/0470592176" target="_blank">The Leadership Challenge Workshop Facilitator's Guide</a>, 4th Edition, by <strong>James M.

               <!-- March 2010 --> <p><strong>Q: Whenever I ask for feedback, people around me will never tell me anything. Their eyes go right down toward their feet, or they say everything is fine. What am I supposed to do? </strong></p> <p><strong>A: </strong>When receiving LPI feedback, many people have bumped into our old friend, question # 16, which reads: "Asks people for feedback on how my actions affect other peoples’ performance." Across the database, this is the lowest rated item on the inventory. This question also is ranked among the lowest with the vast majority of people to whom I provide LPI feedback. And this is a common question I frequently hear about this item, especially from bosses.</p> <p>First, accept the fact that somewhere in this silence lurks an issue of trust. The trust issue may not even be much about you. People may be hesitant to respond because they witness integrity issues in the broader organization, or because they were punished for being candid in previous, similar experiences. However, do not assume that you are the victim of other circumstances and not the cause! You must accept that in some way, you are contributing to their reticence.</p> <p>One of the biggest factors in trust is intentions. Think about how willing you are to totally commit yourself, if you question or doubt someone else’s intentions or motives? The voice in your head poses some pretty thoughtful questions when this occurs. "What is really going on here? Is she trying to sacrifice me to make herself look good? What is the real reason he is asking me to get involved in this project?" You know the questions, because you have likely been in a situation where you have heard them in your head.</p> <p>So perhaps you are not getting a response from others when you ask for feedback because they are too busy trying to answer similar questions about your intentions in their minds – "why am I really being asked for this feedback" or "is it absolutely safe to be truthful?" Think about the caution flags in your head when someone else, especially a boss, asks you to be genuinely forthcoming about his/her deficiencies? It is not easy, is it?</p> <p>In the end, it is leaders who must make it easier and safer. With that in mind, here are some immediate options you can try:</p> 
               <ol> 
                <li>Make your request less formal. Don't close people in your office and seek their feedback as if it were part of a strict, performance management process. Maybe it can start as a brief encounter in the hallway or lunchroom: "I am struggling with how to better show people that I appreciate their work. Can we get together later today to talk about that?" </li> 
                <li>Seek feedback in smaller, more specific pieces: "As you all know, I have a tendency to micromanage the daylights out of people. I would like to stop, or at least slow it down. What are a couple of suggestions you can provide me? </li> 
                <li>Confront the elephant head on: "This may not feel like a safe environment to provide helpful feedback, especially upward. But I really need your help to be better. Leave a note on my desk or coax a stranger to leave your feedback on my voicemail. One day, we will get to a point where we all feel safe to give each other feedback in a more open, personal way." </li> 
               </ol> <p>And then a few last reminders. First, give people some extended time to think about and prepare their responses. Even the stereotypical high extravert, who enjoys the noise of immediate conversation, might appreciate the pause, so as to not feel being put on the spot. Extended time here means later in the day or week, not in the next 5 seconds.</p> <p>Finally, continue to do what you can to demonstrate the integrity of your intentions to improve, <em>by taking action and publicly reporting back</em>. Don't ask for feedback only after you receive LPI feedback. Make it part of your monthly meetings. Periodically, let others know what you are attempting to do to change and what you continue to struggle with. Continue to ask for help. And good luck.</p> <p><strong>Steve Coats</strong>, a Leadership Challenge® Workshop Certified Master, is a managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a leadership development education and consulting firm.

               <!-- Feburary 2010 --> <p><strong>Q: Could you tell me how to interpret the completed LPI Observer questionnaires? For example, if the final mark is 50, what does that really mean? Is it possible to simply say (just an example) 30-40 is poor, 40-50 is acceptable, 50-60 is outstanding? </strong></p> <p><strong>A: </strong>A reasonable question—such as a scholar might approach the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI). However, from a practical standpoint or for purposes of leadership development, we do not categorize individuals or their responses to the LPI questionnaire using words such as "above average" or "below average" or "weak" or "strong." The important thing to remember about the LPI assessment is that it is based on a frequency scale—a ranking that measures how often a leader engages in any one of the 30 behavioral statements. It is not a measure of how pleased one is with their own performance or how satisfied an observer is of the behavior of the leader being assessed.</p> <p>Our view is that results data from the LPI, overall, represent a baseline for each individual on how frequently he or she currently exhibits key leadership behaviors. Wherever that line is—whether it is 50 or 20— it is not a measure against an ultimate number, say 100. Leadership is more like a race in which there is no finish line, and the best leaders are constantly learning and striving to do better (engaging more frequently) in these leadership practices.</p> <p>That said, researchers have looked at the distribution of scores for each practice (because the mean and standard deviations for each vary) and have attached labels to them. And you, of course, are welcome to do the same. However, it would be most accurate to refer to these descriptively in empirical terms, rather than terms that describe effectiveness (e.g., poor, acceptable). In this way, you might refer to responses as "above or below the mean," rather than low or high scores.</p> <p><strong>Barry Posner </strong>is Professor of Leadership at the Leavey School of Business, where he served as Dean for 12 years, at Santa Clara University.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p><em>"There was an unmistakable crack of a firearm...then another and another. Screams echoed throughout the store. Customers and employees seeking cover and darting for the exits. He's got a gun!!! one hollers, followed by more screams and shots..."</em> </p> <p>Unfortunately, this scene is playing out in more and more businesses, government agencies, and in public spaces around the country. With economic turmoil shattering lives, we can only expect these crises to grow and pose an ever-increasing challenge for leaders. </p> <p>The chaos of the times seems to present a new disaster every week, plunging leaders who may be top-notch performers under normal operations into a world of chaos and expectations — situations they are both unequipped to handle and also prone to make well-meaning yet disastrous decisions in the heat of the moment. </p> <p>Leadership in a crisis situation is very different from leadership in a time of normal conditions. On the surface, the Five Practices may not seem to apply to a world turned upside down. But based on my teaching experience, all leaders in government and industry would find the tools useful and provide the foundation for responding to and recovering from any crisis. </p> <p>The organizational operating models that provide the baseline for a smooth-running enterprise during normal times evaporate during a crisis, throwing the leadership into a morass of uncertainty and chaos. But the chaos can be managed successfully if its impacts are understood.</p> 
               <ol> 
                <li>Tension and stress: In any crisis, leaders are thrust into a stressful and tense environment that puts them under enormous psychological, mental, and physical strain. Even the most minor decision made under these circumstances can result in catastrophic impacts. </li> 
                <li>Speed: Everything may initially happen at warp speed, giving little time for thoughtful consideration or consultation. In a crisis, worlds collide and time is the first victim. </li> 
                <li>Personnel: The right people may not be available to respond to the crisis, resulting in untrained and inexperienced leaders being called upon to step into the chaos. Without the right people the organization will stumble in normal times, but during a crisis the problems are accentuated exponentially. </li> 
                <li>Organization: Businesses and governments are not necessarily organized to handle crisis. In fact, the organizational hierarchy may be a hindrance to response and recovery. The flexibility to adapt the organization to the situation is critical to success. </li> 
                <li>Stakeholders: The list of stakeholders will rapidly expand, bringing in to play new channels of communication, new expectations, and new players--all simultaneously. Suppliers, regulators, families, customers, hospitals, law enforcement will all require a leaders time and interaction. </li> 
                <li>Communication: The normal channels of communication may not be operative or may be overloaded, requiring new channels and protocols that must be quickly mastered. </li> 
                <li>Media: The leader in crisis has the media spotlight suddenly amplified, all waiting to report and find fault. </li> 
                <li>Simplicity: Simplicity is the key in a crisis. Simplicity ultimately wins. The more complex a leader makes a solution in a crisis the less likely success will be the end result. </li> 
               </ol> <p>Understanding the impact a crisis has on the leader is critical to stepping up to the podium as an instructor or facilitator. In teaching crisis leadership in over 100 seminars and workshops, the following lessons can help you prepare:</p> 
               <ol> 
                <li>Experiential: Provide your audience with an example of a crisis that is as real as possible, addressing as many of the above impacts as appropriate. For example, text prepared messages to your audience during the workshop; use relevant, practical organization applications that the audience can identify with, have a roving reporter stress the audience with uncomfortable questions and inquisitions. I have even hit plastic golf balls into the audience to add a little tension and stress to the workshop. Make the environment of the session as real as possible. If you are not going to make it real, they can read a book and not get the leadership crisis experience. </li> 
                <li>Do your homework: Each organization has different stress points and leadership expectations. What creates a crisis in the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is very different from a large multinational conglomerate. Teaching leadership in crisis without understanding the organization will certainly undermine the effectiveness of the workshop. </li> 
                <li>Audio Visuals: Use as many audio visual tools as practical. They not only educate and entertain, but also can be used to control an audience. There are any number of products available on the internet. I have never had a problem finding the right clip to demonstrate a point. </li> 
                <li>Case studies: Actual events that make the point and are relevant to the organization in training are invaluable. In workshops for the food safety community, for example, I draw upon cases from various incidents in food contamination; for public utilities, ice storms and hurricanes; for major corporations, commodity futures exposure. </li> 
               </ol> <p>Applying the lessons of <em>The Leadership Challenge</em> to a crisis becomes a matter of common sense. As a brief demonstration of the application of the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® to crisis leadership, I offer the following:</p> <p>Model the Way: In my experience as a leader in business and the military, the quickest way to lose your leadership credentials is to not demonstrate balance in a crisis. Instead of calmly addressing a crisis at hand, the inept crisis leader will lose control of his/her actions, temper, emotions, or awareness. In the Navy we call it "losing the bubble"; not being aware of the tactical situation at sea can cost lives. Demonstrate balanced leadership.</p> <p>Inspire a Shared Vision: It is critical in a crisis that we all share the same goal. We may have different reasons for the goal but we have the goal in common. For example, the obvious goal is to return to normalcy. To employees this means ensuring that their job survives, while an executive worries about stopping the revenue loss. Return to normalcy.</p> <p>Challenge the Process: The organizational processes are stressed in any crisis and may become dysfunctional. A leader in crisis must have the flexibility to adapt to the situation, regardless of the inherent processes of the organization. Flexibility to adapt.</p> <p>Enable Others to Act: In a crisis, much more than in normal operations, effective partnerships are critical to the success. Simply put, partnerships save lives.</p> <p>Encourage the Heart: Taking care of the response staff is not much different in a crisis as in normal operating situations. What is different is the stress the team is under and how fast this can change. A leader in crisis needs to be more aware of the physical, psychological, and mental condition of the team. An operative that has been controlling an evacuation for 12 hours straight may need time out to regroup. The leader must be aware and respond. </p> <p>It is critical for a leader to be aware as the environment becomes dysfunctional or begins to stabilize. Although the general rules for leading in a crisis are different, they are not outside the parameters of The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. Today, our world is routinely in crisis mode. And even though one leadership style does not fit all, when it comes to dealing with a crisis situation, we are fortunate to have a guide like <em>The Leadership Challenge</em> to serve as the foundation of organizational crisis response and recovery. </p> <p><strong>Gordon Meriwether</strong>, a retired Navy Captain, is the Founder of The Uriah Group, a crisis leadership consultancy.

               <!--January 2010: Model the Way--> <p>It is possible to be a Leader, and yet not demonstrate Leadership. However, the reverse is not true: it is not possible to demonstrate Leadership and not be a Leader. What?</p> <p>What does it mean to be a Leader, and how is it possible to be a Leader and not be demonstrating Leadership? It begins with the very definition of the word Leader: a person who leads—one who is "out in front" or "first." The focus of this type of out-in-front Leader is the self. For example, think about the sales industry. Many recognition and reward programs are established to identify the "sales leader." This person is acknowledged as the one leading other sales professionals in volume or dollars and is generally identified as "the one to beat." Often the people who are "behind" the sales leader are lagging in numeric performance; they are intentionally not "following the leader." These followers may not aspire to be more like the leader, other than to experience similar sales results and performance. In fact, they would rather be "out in front" themselves and might do whatever is required to achieve or maintain this first place status. Because of this achievement orientation, followers may even personally dislike the leader. Similarly, the sales leader may not want anyone else on the team to exceed his/her own performance level, which would result in the loss of the leader's own personal recognition and reward. So even though there are people "following" the leader (in that they are behind), the leader may not be doing anything to support the follower's growth and success. Being a leader can be an independent, solo initiative, without the care or concern of another's growth and contributions.</p> <p>Because we typically do not willingly follow hypocrisy, to demonstrate Leadership a person must also be a credible Leader. It is important to followers that a Leader personify the characteristics of Leadership that matter most: honesty, inspiration, foresight, and emotional competence. In other words, demonstrating Leadership requires the Leader to be a behavioral "model" that others aspire to be more like. This Leader type cares deeply about his/her constituents' growth and contributions, sometimes more deeply than they care about themselves. And in demonstrating the dynamics of extraordinary Leadership, people willingly mobilize and follow the guidance this credible Leader provides, even at times contributing more than is required. Followers of this Leader type typically both admire and respect the person. Their desire to contribute is further fueled because they believe in and buy into the cause. Since they can clearly see the intentions, they are willing to take risks in order to achieve the desired outcomes. As a contributing member of a committed team, they are both empowered and enabled to contribute to the cause. Lastly and just as important, they are recognized and encouraged for their contributions and accomplishments all along the way.</p> <p>In the art of Leadership, the focus shifts beyond the self. As defined by Jim and Barry in The Leadership Challenge, "Leadership is the art of mobilizing others to struggle for shared aspirations." This change in focus—from self to others—does not typically occur without some conscious intention and effort. It requires energy and skill, and dedicated practice to become highly accomplished in making this transition. While most development models focus either on developing Leaders, or on enhancing people's ability to demonstrate Leadership, The Leadership Challenge development strategy incorporates both Leader and Leadership. This development combination of an evidence-based leadership model is a market distinguishing characteristic of The Leadership Challenge! So remember, it means a lot more to demonstrate the art of Leadership, than it does to simply be a Leader!

               <!--September 2009: --> <p>On January 24, 2009, at St. George's University in Grenada, keynote speaker Brenda Stutsky welcomed a new class of students into the four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree program—only the second class in the University's history—by encouraging the 26 young men and women to begin their education as leaders. Drawing upon the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® and The Leadership Challenge model, she challenged her audience to incorporate these essential principles of leadership into their education and professional careers, noting that if they do, "I know you will be a nursing leader throughout your educational program and your nursing career."</p> <p>Grounded in the belief that while many prominent leaders may have helped guide the way for these new students, Ms. Stutsky suggested that each individual was poised on that day to begin to lead nursing into the future. And to help them on this new path, she went on to outline how each young person in the audience could exemplify the Five Practices:</p> <p>"Going first and setting an example, educating yourself, and doing what you say you will do, are examples of how you <strong>Model the Way</strong>…As you are only the second class to begin your nursing education at St. George's University, you will always be regarded as the ones who modeled the way. So make sure that you share your stories of being a nursing student with your sisters, brothers, nieces, and nephews. Set an example for them, and let them know that with hard work and determination anything is possible.</p> <p>To <strong>Inspire a Shared Vision</strong>, you begin by imagining what could be, by dreaming and creating something no one else has created. As students in a new nursing program, you are in an ideal position to establish a vision for your student body and this nursing program. Maybe your collective vision for this program is to be internationally recognized for producing extraordinary nursing graduates who are able to provide exemplary patient care not only here in Grenada, but around the world. I want my colleagues in Canada to know about you! Many know about your Medical program, but they don't know you have started a Nursing program. How are you as a student body going to become internationally recognized? Start with small steps. I think one of the first things you have to do is to let the international nursing student community know that you exist. Maybe you do that by starting your own student body Web site or wiki to share your own knowledge and stories with each other. Maybe you then ask nursing students in neighboring Caribbean countries to join in. Maybe your student body president attends a nursing conference in the Unites States, England, Africa, or Canada, and shares your concept of an online community of learning for nursing students in the Caribbean. Nurses in other countries love the idea and join your online community, sharing their own expertise, knowledge, and stories. However you decide to inspire a shared vision, start small but dream big, and follow that dream.</p> <p>Kouzes and Posner say you must always ask, "Why are we doing it this way?" Since you will be one of the first students to complete the newly established courses, your faculty will rely on you to provide constructive feedback that will continually shape the nursing curriculum. Your clinical practice as students here in Grenada and other countries will challenge not only your own nursing skills and knowledge. It will be expected that you will challenge and question policies, procedures, and practices based on current evidence-based knowledge…Leaders take risks. And although risks can sometimes result in failure, we learn from our mistakes and continue to <strong>Challenge the Process</strong>.</p> <p>With <strong>Enable Others to Act</strong>, Kouzes and Posner equate leadership with team effort. They also say that it is very easy to identify a true leader by how many times a leader says "We" as opposed to "I." It is impossible to provide quality patient care without working as a team, for each healthcare professional and discipline adds their piece to the complex puzzle. Learn about your role as a nurse and how you can support your healthcare team, and in return, you will get the support that you need.</p> <p><strong>Encouraging the Heart</strong> of your fellow nursing students is extremely important. This is going to be a very demanding time in your lives, and you will need to make sacrifices to be successful. It is without question that you will need the support of your family…but you also need the support of your fellow students. Providing positive feedback and ongoing encouragement to your fellow nursing students is crucial, as there will be many fun and wonderful stories that you will be able to tell for years to come. But there will also be tough and challenging times and you will need that "pat on the back" or that shoulder to cry on from someone who can really understand what you are going through…Your faculty also needs an encouraging word along the way, so don't forget to tell them when they did a great job, when they helped you understand a difficult concept, or when they helped you get through a challenging clinical day.</p> <p>…In closing, I wish to show you the front page of the <em>Winnipeg Free Press</em> newspaper from Wednesday morning that shows Barak Obama as he became the 44th president of the United States, and the first African-American president in history.

               <!--July 2009: Leadership Reflections--> <p>I recently had the privilege of attending the graduation ceremony for the class of 2009 at Jefferson Medical College. About 250 students were awarded diplomas and granted the right to practice medicine. Each of them, no doubt, felt a great sense of pride and joy (and relief) when they heard the title "doctor" affixed to their names, as they were called on stage to receive their diplomas and sashes. </p> <p>While most medical school graduation ceremonies follow a fairly standard format I suppose, to my surprise there was one part of this program that moved me in a most unexpected way: the final assignment these graduates had to complete before officially becoming doctors was to publicly recite the Oath of Hippocrates. Led by the calming and mellow voice of one of the faculty, they concluded their vow and, at long last, became welcomed members of a wonderful and truly respected profession. And even though they do not remember all the words, new doctors know the oath exists and what it stands for.</p> <p>The Hippocratic Oath is often casually summarized by non-medical types as "do no harm." Yet, nowhere in the actual text do those three words appear. There are some other remarkable words, however, that spell out the standards of behavior and personal commitment expected of doctors. In fact, it was the Oath's closing line that truly grabbed me: "These things I do promise upon my honor." What a powerful statement that was for me. It was the notion of honor that was so inspiring. Yet almost immediately after hearing it, I must sadly admit that the first thought that popped into my head was, "what has happened to it?"</p> <p><strong>Current State of Honor</strong><br> I recently worked with a group of Army personnel plus others from a state law enforcement agency. Based on their words and behaviors, it is clear that honor is still of supreme importance in both organizations. But outside of these examples, one could easily make a case that honor has been replaced by greed, self interest, or perhaps even the convenience of taking the easy road, especially if the honorable road is too hard. I began to wonder, how much better off might we be if we knew that everyone truly valued honor, and that it would never be compromised? Might our current circumstances be different if other professions were bound by an oath of excellence, based on honor? </p> <p>Early in the Hippocratic Oath, a doctor solemnly swears that "into whatsoever house I shall enter, it shall be for the good of the sick to the utmost of my power." In the very next statement doctors pledge to keep themselves "from wrong, from corruption, from the tempting of others to vice." Can this be said of other professions today? Pick any one you like. Is the perception that the AIGs of the world, or lawyers, politicians, or journalists have pledged to keep themselves from the temptations of wrong, corruption, or vice? It seems to me that the relentless forces of the Dark Side are especially strong these days.</p> <p><strong>Whom Do We Trust</strong><br> The cynics will certainly shout out that doctors fall off the wagon as well. And that is true. However in a number of various survey findings related to trust, doctors as a profession are usually rated toward the top. Business leaders, government, attorneys, and media types are usually toward the bottom. There are, of course, many individuals in each of these professions who do value honor and attempt to live by it. But there are certainly plenty of examples of those that don't and the havoc they create.</p> <p>So what do you think? When you reflect on honor in a profession, where do doctors rank for you? How about when you look beyond medicine? Do you see much evidence that in our current world—anywhere— honor is considered important anymore? How about when you look within yourself? Just how important is it to you? In your work today, is there anything you are willing to promise, upon your honor?</p> <p><strong>The Impact of an Oath</strong><br> I have no idea how much difference the Hippocratic Oath actually makes, if any. My guess is that not many graduating medical school students remember more than a handful of the words, let alone could they talk in detail about it. But they do know it is there. They know they have something that defines the ideals and values of their profession. They know that it is not just a collection of words on a plaque but is, in fact, a definition of the kind of person they are expected to be in order to be called "Doctor." And they have pledged their commitment to it.</p> <p>Who knows? Maybe if every so often brokers or executives, lobbyists or politicians, or the rest of us for that matter had to publicly promise, upon our honor, that "my work shall be for the good to the utmost of my power," the world might be a less troubled, more trusting place. It certainly would do no harm.</p> <p>Personally, I hope that honor is not a tired ideal of the past. But even if you are not part of a profession or organization that is guided by a publicly declared promise of honor, you can still choose to live your life by that same noble standard. You can choose to turn away from the seductive temptations of wrong, corruption, and vice, and instead be a role model of acting with honor, in everything you do, on and off the job. That would most assuredly make the world a better place.</p> <p><strong>Steve Coats</strong>, a Leadership Challenge® Workshop Master Facilitator, is a managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a leadership development education and consulting firm.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>In the ongoing Characteristics of Admired Leaders survey measurements, the attribute of competence has consistently been one of the four most frequently selected items (by approximately 68% of respondents), indicating that people have a strong expectation that their leaders know what they are doing. But with virtually every facet of the business economy plummeting over the past few months, the question of competence has been gnawing at me.&nbsp; Specifically, where is it?&nbsp; Where are the capabilities required to lead companies (and the country, for that matter) forward?&nbsp; Based on recent performance scorecards, competence appears to be lacking.&nbsp; </p> <p>It is often said that anyone can steer a ship in calm waters, but it takes competence at the helm to navigate treacherous seas—like the ones we now find ourselves in.&nbsp; And my perception is that very few people in senior leadership positions—whether in the public and private sector—are competent to effectively navigate in the crippling times we are currently encountering.&nbsp; During what we once called the 'calmer' waters of the early 2000s, growth (or at least the illusion of it) was literally taken for granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; But look what has happened since the economic storms moved in. There appears to be more reactive behavior than proactive, innovative action.</p> <p>I am likely not the only one disappointed with the current performance of our business and government leaders.&nbsp; But, why should this competence shortage be surprising?&nbsp; Most of those in leadership positions today have never had to deal with the situations they are now confronting.&nbsp; While they may be seasoned leaders, that doesn't mean they are fully capable of dealing with everything thrown their way.&nbsp; However, keep in mind: we know that the best leaders—TLC-type leaders—take on the task of constantly preparing themselves for unknown challenges.&nbsp; They are continuously learning, experiencing, blundering, and learning some more.&nbsp; I wonder if too many of our current leaders got caught up in the belief that the seas would always be relatively calm and that their positions automatically made them competent to steer the ship.&nbsp; </p> <p>Consider Captain Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger, at the helm when US Airways flight 1549 needed to be brought to safety—in the Hudson River. &nbsp;Last I looked, learning how to fly a glider was not mandatory for pilots, but many people are forever grateful that Sully had taken the time to build his capabilities. The life-threatening, emergency situation he was thrown into was an entirely new and unprecedented challenge for him.&nbsp; Yet, in his interview on <em>60 Minutes</em>, he commented that he was absolutely certain he could safely land his plane on the water.&nbsp; What a statement!&nbsp; Never forget that competence builds confidence. </p> <p>Although there are many areas in which leaders must be competent, there are three (perhaps a bit unusual ones) on which I hope future leaders will continue to focus development time and energy.&nbsp; </p> 
               <ol> 
                <li>Know right from wrong, and courageously act on what is right.&nbsp; (Hmm, there is that Model the Way thing again.)&nbsp; </li> 
                <li>Lead for the future, not for the quarter.&nbsp; Think about the number of 'invincible' companies that have lost sight of this and have ceased to exist—or are on the verge of collapse—as a result. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li> 
                <li>Understand the importance of and find ways to pursue the common good, not just the selfish, immediate win.&nbsp; There are consequences when commission-driven, valueless products that produce immediate wealth for individual companies or people are allowed to trump longer term, value-based offerings that produce enduring wealth for customers and societies, along with profit for companies and their workers. </li> 
               </ol> <p>Let us hope that all leaders will add these three important factors to what they must do well in order to navigate through the treacherous seas of our time.</p> <p><strong>Steve Coats </strong>is a managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a leadership development education and consulting firm, and a Leadership Challenge® Workshop Master Facilitator.

               <!-- March 2009 --> <p><strong>Q: I have always thought that the key to successful leadership is influence, not authority. Do you agree? </strong></p> <p><strong>A: </strong>The answer to that question, it seems to me, lies in whether the goal is to get others to work from a place of compliance or from a place of commitment. I believe that is the difference between influential leadership and authoritative leadership. Working within an influential leadership model, committed employees will give up discretionary time to solve problems, serve customers, and think creatively. On the other hand, people working under authoritative leadership– or –command and control, as we more commonly know it will work to achieve compliance, doing only what needs to be done to get by.</p> <p>It is well documented that organizations perform better when all employees work collaboratively across organizational lines, and are allowed to voice their opinions and have healthy open discussions. Leaders who are great at listening to diverse opinions and can facilitate teams in moving toward solutions–without 'telling' team members what to do–are leaders of influence that can create positive working environments, remove organizational obstacles, and provide tools employees need to perform their jobs effectively. Influential leaders create environments that are: </p> 
               <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> 
                <li>Trusting </li> 
                <li>Collaborative </li> 
                <li>Open </li> 
                <li>Sharing </li> 
               </ul> <p>In return, employees will use their talents and skills to achieve the mission and vision of the organization. This is especially true of younger workers coming into the workforce today who do not respond well to –command and control– leaders or to those who merely exert their authority. They want freedom and control over their areas of responsibility and to use their talents and skills to solve problems. Gen X and Gen Y are motivated through teamwork, with fewer rules and goals. What they don't want is to be micro- managed by a leader constantly telling them what to do and how to do it. Authoritative leaders who attempt to control the organization and the people who work in it will find that employees disengage and are less committed to helping the organization achieve its goals. Leading from a place of authority does not create the trusting environment required for success. Instead it often leads to second-guessing, potential hidden agendas, and a less productive workforce.</p> <p>Effective leaders help people understand how their contributions fit into the broader vision and inspire the team to achieve the greater good of the organization. Inspiration is not mandated, dictated or driven by authority. It is achieved by enlisting others, touching the hearts of employees while engaging their brains–through the influence of leaders.</p> <p>While authoritative leadership only has room for one leader, influential leadership allows the leader in everyone to be brought forward. In today's fast-paced, rapidly changing environment, everyone has to be a leader.</p>

               <!--November 2009: Inspire A Shared Vision by Renee Harness--> <p>In a meeting earlier this year with a senior leadership team of a client company, our collective group was discussing how the practice Inspire a Shared Vision provides hope to people in the most challenging times. The idea appeared to be an appropriate, logical assumption. But as we transitioned into a related topic, the CEO stopped us and asked what we meant by 'hope'. Did we mean that we were "hoping we would meet our targets," and "hoping that the company didn't lose money?" If so, we needed action and engagement—not hope—to meet the company's needs.</p> <p>This was an excellent question (though I have to admit, I thought "Haven't you heard Obama speak about HOPE? That's what we're talking about!") Clarity came, however, when my partner, Jo Bell, observed that we were focusing on 'hope' as a noun, not a verb. We are not simply hoping that things change in the environment. Leaders act and inspire hope in others and engage them in the future success of the company.</p> <p>Taking this lesson from the challenges our singular client company was facing and applying it more universally, inspiring hope in others is critical for ALL leaders. This is especially true as companies experience difficulties that are a result of our current economic turmoil, and have had to make difficult decisions about the business they are in or the staff that they can support.</p> <p>Challenging times like these are the most difficult in which to lead. However, in this environment, it is even more critical that leaders inspire people to give their best. Inspiring a shared vision amid layoffs, downsizing, and radical changes in the way we do business is tough. But as Jim and Barry often say, "that's why it's the Leadership CHALLENGE, and not the Leadership Cakewalk."</p> <p>Many of the leaders we work with tell us that Inspire a Shared Vision is their most difficult leadership Practice (indeed, it is the lowest ranked Practice across leaders)—especially in the current environment. But the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI) can provide a clue to how the best leaders Inspire a Shared Vision in even the toughest times. It provides actions you can take as a leader to become more inspiring and to engage those around you.</p> <p>First, let's take a look at some of the key leadership behaviors that define this Practice. </p> 
               <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                 #7: Describes a compelling image of the future
                 <br> #12: Appeals to others to share dream of the future
                 <br> #17: Shows others how their interests can be realized
                </blockquote>
               </blockquote>Interestingly, these behaviors also tend to be ranked the lowest of the10 rated on the LPI. <p>Many leaders find these behaviors difficult, but for different reasons. Some do not see them as part of their role (it's someone else's responsibility). Others are not naturally visual learners, so have a hard time visualizing the future.</p> <p>In our coaching work with leaders, we have found that two other easily actionable LPI behaviors can influence a leader's ability to Inspire a Shared Vision. When leaders focus on these behaviors, their scores in this Practice (and, indeed, their ability to Inspire) show an increase. These are: </p> 
               <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                 #26: Is clear about his/her philosophy of leadership
                 <br> #27: Speaks with conviction about the meaning of work
                </blockquote>
               </blockquote><strong>Philosophy of Leadership</strong><br> At The Leadership Challenge Forum in Augusts of 2009, Barry Posner discussed how he believed that a philosophy of leadership was a critical component of leadership. If leaders do not know who they are or what they stand for, it is difficult to lead and inspire hope. So what is your leadership philosophy? If someone came up to you in the hallway and asked that question, would you have an answer? If so, wonderful! It is probably clear to others as well, in the way that you discuss what you believe in and why. If not, how can you become clearer on your philosophy of leadership? Ask yourself these questions*: 
               <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></ul> 
               <ul> 
                <li>What do I believe in? Why? </li> 
                <li>What do I stand for? Why? </li> 
                <li>How do I want to be remembered….tonight? Why? </li> 
                <li>What brings me suffering? Why? </li> 
                <li>What makes me jump for joy? Why? </li> 
               </ul> 
               <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> 
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></ul> 
               </blockquote> <p>* The Leadership Challenge, 4th edition, pages 69-70</p> <p>When you have answers to these questions, think about how that translates to your leadership philosophy. Write out a philosophy and begin to share it with others. This doesn't necessarily mean you state that you want to share your philosophy, but rather that you begin to talk about what really matters to you, what you believe about your people and your work.</p> <p><strong>Speaking with Conviction about the Meaning of Work</strong><br> Creating a philosophy of leadership leads to the second leadership behavior that can influence your ability to inspire: to speak with conviction about the meaning of your work. Though you may have difficulty predicting exactly what the future will look like for your organization or department, if you talk about the meaning of your work, you can continue to inspire others. Ask yourself these questions: </p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>What important work is your group doing for others? </li> 
                <li>How do you help serve a need? </li> 
                <li>What are some of your success stories with customers (both internal and external)? </li> 
               </ul> Once you have clarity for yourself about the meaning of your work, share this with others. When critical issues come up, reinforce this. When the challenging times in your work threaten to bring your group down, reinforce why your work matters. <p>These may be difficult changes in "the way we've always done things," and it may take a while for people to catch on to this new "enthusiasm." But our leadership challenge today is to help bring hope to others. If we can challenge ourselves to step into uncomfortable territory, we lead the way for others and can inspire and engage the best.</p> <p>This is my hope for you!</p> <p><strong>Renee Harness</strong> is Managing Partner at Third Eye Leadership, where she is engaged in corporate culture change.

               <!-- January 2009 --> <p><strong>Q: The Leadership Challenge is among the most comprehensive, clear, and practical books on leadership I have ever read. Through many readings, I have discovered aspects of leadership I had never considered before as well as those I'd only imagined or considered as abstract perceptions. However, there is still one factor that inhibits me from fully engaging in the leadership challenge: my sense of being an ordinary person, no more or less intelligent than others, always makes me ask, why should anyone follow me? Why should others listen to my ideas when they have their own mind to listen to? Why should I envision a future for others, if this will lead them to follow my path instead of a path of their own design? </strong></p> <p><strong>A: </strong>Two quick thoughts on your question. First, leadership has to start somewhere, and with someone. So, why not with you and your ideas? If you have the courage, the sense of direction, and the internal drive and motivation to achieve results, why not begin the journey by setting an example (leading the way)? The Leadership Challenge, after all, is fundamentally about how ordinary people exercise leadership to get extraordinary things done by establishing the foundation of credibility and then putting The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® into action each and every day. </p> <p>Second, leadership is not all about the leader's vision. Of course, an essential part of effective leadership is the ability to demonstrate–in action and words–that the vision you have for the future is where others want to go as well. But getting there takes more than an individual leader and more than just a single idea or dream. Consider that you may get something started – a change initiative, for example, that is rooted in your personal passion and credibility. Based upon input, involvement, and feedback from others, what might have begun as "your idea" becomes "our idea." The future you may have first envisioned has no doubt morphed into a shared vision that incorporates the dreams and aspirations of others, which is precisely how leaders, in the final analysis, turn followers into leaders themselves.</p> <p>If you are inclined to explore this issue further, you also may find reading <a href="http://www.wiley.com/buy/0787982962">A Leader's Legacy</a> helpful. In this book, my co-author, Jim Kouzes, and I explore a number of topics, including the very notion of how leadership is not just about one leader's vision, why it takes courage to –make a life,– how to liberate the leader in everyone, and ultimately, how the legacy you leave is the life you lead.</p>

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p><strong>—Seton Hall Helped Angie Chaplin '05 Transform her Life. Now She's Passing the Favor On.</strong></p> <p>When the Cedar River's banks overflowed this June, devastating Angie Chaplin's Waverly, Iowa, community with a "500-year" flood, she drew upon one of the most critical lessons of her life: how to lead others. </p> <p>It was a lesson she'd learned at Seton Hall, through SetonWorldWide's online Master of Arts in Strategic Communication and Leadership (MASCL) program. It's a lesson she now shares with others, as a nonprofit leadership instructor in Iowa and as a MASCL faculty member.</p> <p>After the flood struck, Chaplin sprang into action with her husband, Casey, and their sons, 8-year-old Jacob and 6-year-old Jeremy — cleaning out homes and serving meals to volunteers, while hundreds of residents felt the disaster's impact.</p> <p>Coping with their losses in the wake of the receding river, many residents placed blame on city officials. "Hearing community members speak out during a public meeting made me think there are lessons to be learned, even in disaster," Chaplin recalls. "There had to be a way to help the city extract those lessons."</p> <p>Chaplin contacted the city administrator and offered to lead a debriefing. Once she received the go-ahead, she sought expertise from SetonWorldWide's MASCL network. Col. Rob Cerjan, M.A. '06 offered to work with Chaplin on the project, utilizing a debriefing format used in the Army.</p> <p>Together, Cerjan and Chaplin facilitated a review of Waverly's emergency operations center and produced a report that focused on crisis communication. "This experience is a proud accomplishment, and the credit goes to MASCL for the connections made and lessons taught," Chaplin says. "When I started the program, I never imagined it would make such an impact in my community."</p> <p>Chaplin's journey began when she enrolled in SetonWorldWide's MASCL program and was introduced to The Leadership Challenge, a book and leadership development program written by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner. "They had me from page one," she laughs.</p> <p>Drawn to the practice of "Model the Way," which encourages leaders to find their own voice, Chaplin made a discovery. "An ‘a-ha moment' came when I realized I was suppressing my voice," she explains.</p> <p>At that time, Chaplin lacked confidence, a situation that stemmed from a personal health crisis — morbid obesity. Encouraged by her fellow Seton Hall students and teachers, she examined her life. "My physical, emotional and psychological health were deteriorating, and I realized I had allowed my weight to inhibit my ability to lead," she says.</p> <p>Four months after she started Seton Hall's program, Chaplin underwent gastric-bypass surgery.</p> <p>By graduation, she had shed more than 100 pounds, but the transformation was more than physical. "The surgery was a step toward a healthier life, not a solution," Chaplin says.</p> <p>Once she committed to living well, Chaplin used her new, confident approach to cross the finish lines of four national marathons, two of them as a charity athlete with the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team in Training.</p> <p>Chaplin also found that she could empower others to release their own leadership voices. Employed by Lutheran Services in Iowa, a nonprofit human-services organization, she helped inspire its entrepreneurial Center for Learning and Leading. There, she designs and facilitates strategies for nonprofit and academic leaders around the country that generate revenue to support LSI's mission.</p> <p>Karl Soehnlein, Ph.D., program director for the online MASCL program, jokes that Chaplin is the program's "poster girl." But behind his kidding lies deep respect. "When I met Angie, I knew there was something special about her," he says. "I just sensed it — her positiveness, her excitement, her passion." So when it came time to bring in a new faculty member, he looked no further than his former student.</p> <p>As a professor, Chaplin presents leadership lessons during the program's weekend orientation residency and teaches the very module that changed her life.</p> <p>"I lead because I've been led to find my leadership voice," she says. "It's humbling to teach in a program that continues to teach me. I learn as much from students and fellow faculty as they hopefully learn from me."</p> <p>Chaplin sings the praises of the program on a nearly daily basis, and her endorsement is genuine. "It sounds like a late-night infomercial," Chaplin says. "But it's difficult for me to even imagine my life without MASCL — it fuels a passion for learning, leading and life.</p> <p>"Leaders can't do everything, but we can do something," she adds. "Whether it's running, teaching, leading or serving, we have an obligation to do what we can, where we can, when we can. It's as simple as that." </p> <p><strong>Shannon Rossman Allen </strong>is a freelance writer based in Fort Worth, Texas.

               <!--<a name="sept2008"></a>September 2008:  By Craig Haptonstall--> <p>Given the many resources and training strategies in today's marketplace, we are challenged to better understand the differences between all these various resources. Gaining clarity around what each has to offer will help us determine which tool to apply to a given situation to more effectively achieve our desired outcomes and goals.</p> <p>Currently, one of the more popular tools used in a variety of training initiatives is The Gallup Organization's StrengthsFinder. As described in a recent article provided by the Career Planning and Adult Development Network, "StrengthsFinder is a talent assessment instrument developed expressly for the Internet. It is built upon three primary discoveries that resulted from decades of research of successful human beings. Skills can be learned, and knowledge can be obtained. However, talent—the key to strength and peak performance - must exist naturally within a person. A talent is a naturally recurring pattern of thought, feeling, or behavior that can be productively applied. Talents are spontaneous, top-of-mind, perhaps even subconscious reactions to situations…what one does well "without even thinking about it." They are innate, non-teachable.</p> <p>Based on 34 StrengthsFinder talent themes, the StrengthsFinder instrument presents 180 paired-choice comparisons in sets that present two potential self-descriptors-each anchoring polar ends of a continuum. Using online connectivity that is fully secure and easy to use, participants are prompted to choose from each pair the statement that best describes them, and the extent to which that chosen option is self-descriptive. Participants are given 20 seconds to respond to a given item before the system moves on.</p> <p>For those interested in finding their best "fit" among the possible organizational roles and positions, the StrengthsFinder instrument is a great tool. Gaining talent clarity allows us to pursue roles and positions that are best suited to our innate talents, and can offer the greatest opportunity to achieve superior performance and personal satisfaction. With talents, we are not trying to develop anything new; we are simply working to become more aware of what is already there.</p> <p>So, what about the position or role of leading others?</p> <p>Different than the StrengthsFinder model, The Leadership Challenge discusses a role that transcends any specific position in an organization: the role or position of a strong leader that demonstrates leadership in the eyes of others.</p> <p>The 25 years of academic evidence collected and reported on by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner suggests it is possible for anyone-independent of role or talent-to become a better leader, developing our abilities to influence others to achieve extraordinary results. In their best-selling book, The Leadership Challenge, Kouzes and Posner identify The Five Leadership Practices®—Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act, and Encourage the Heart—as five behavior sets we can develop and enhance with practice.</p> <p>In over 13 years of applying and practicing the principles of The Leadership Challenge with people and organizations, I have also become convinced that leadership is a learnable behavior set, if three things happen: </p> 
               <ol> 
                <li>First and foremost, we must make a conscious decision to become a better leader and to become more effective in demonstrating leadership. Until this personal decision is made, no amount of evidence or research will make a difference. </li> 
                <li>We need to gain some "outsight": information beyond what we currently have to work with, which can come from research, books, assessments, or any number of places. This is also where The Leadership Challenge book and The Leadership Practices Inventory® (LPI) can really support learning. While the book represents over 25 years of academic research, the LPI is a valid and reliable 360- degree assessment that uses 30 questions to identify developmental benchmarks within The Five Leadership Practices®. </li> 
                <li>In order for leadership (or any other skill set) to develop, we must practice new behavior. This is where The Leadership Challenge® Workshop supports development. By creating a safe learning environment, with proven instructional practice, we can document elevated leadership levels as a positive learning outcome. This workshop can be delivered in a variety of ways and days, as best identified by the participating party. </li> 
               </ol> <p>So, if the goal is to increase awareness of innate strengths and talents, the Stengthsfinder is a great resource. With this information we can pursue positions and roles that will enable us to do what we like to do, and will potentially be the best at doing.</p> <p>On the other hand, if the goal is to develop our skills and abilities in influencing others to achieve extraordinary outcomes, The Leadership Challenge is the very best resource in the market today as a comprehensive set of tools for succeeding in our roles as leaders and demonstrating higher leadership levels.</p> <p><strong>Craig Haponstall</strong> is president and CEO of Leadership Mechanics, LLC and a Master Facilitator of The Leadership Challenge® Workshop.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>When you're stuck in shifting beach sand up past your ankles, unable to tear your gaze from the tsunami about to slam into the shore, the last thing that would be on your mind is, "Now would be a good time to be inspired by a shared vision".</p> <p>No way.</p> <p>Instead, you either freeze in place waiting for the inevitable, or you frantically try to extricate yourself, to run in the opposite direction. While neither one is very practical, both are very understandable behaviors, given the situation. However, this scenario is an environmental disaster of a different nature: our 4,000 person company is about to be acquired by a software behemoth almost 20 times our size.</p> <p>Regardless of whether or not you've ever been "the acquired", imagine yourself facing that tsunami in other areas of your life, and you can relate to the chaos, confusion, uncertainty and fear that follows an event of such magnitude. In addition to an acquisition, such feelings can occur with a job change, a move, death, divorce, or serious illness. And, as much as we yearn for a leader to rescue us-Indiana Jones style-we so often feel alone, helpless, and ineffective.</p> <p>With little information coming from our new overlords, and not much to do but wait and see, some employees can become paralyzed: "Who will tell me what to work on?" Others become hyperactive, racing to close another deal, finish the marketing plan, get that product release out the door. And still others will leave, preferring to strike out on their own. In such situations, survival skills (e.g., defend territory, look busy) often trump strategy as people begin to shut down, pull back, and play it safe.</p> <p>Why plan anything when the future is so unknown?</p> <p>There are two key reasons: Personal. Leadership.</p> <p>As in: Why not equip our high potential employees with important leadership practices to bring with them into their next role? Why not use this time to help our best talent take a step back, and: </p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Explore who they are becoming as leaders </li> 
                <li>Look at what's important to them personally </li> 
                <li>Develop a personal vision of leadership to share </li> 
               </ul> <p>Based on a successful Leadership Challenge® Workshop pilot we had held the previous fall, I contacted Steve Houchin of International Leadership Associates to discuss next steps. After initial hellos, and an update on the looming acquisition, his first comment was, "I suppose all training has been cancelled." "Why no," I replied. "I want to complete two workshops before we wind down the company." Silence for a heartbeat on the phone. "Really," he said. It wasn't a question; it was a statement. We got to work, planning two workshops over the following two months.</p> <p>In the midst of the chaos and distractions dealing with various crises and issues related to the acquisition, about a dozen people committed the time and energy to focus on The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership®. Although the sessions drew fewer of our high potential employees than Steve and I would have liked, everyone understood that this was an opportunity to focus on developing a personal vision. They stepped up, and stepped into their developing leadership capabilities.</p> <p>In both sessions, we acknowledged up front how difficult it would be to "Inspire a Shared Vision" about work, when no one knew their role, team goals, or even what team they would be on within two months. Yet, they all "nailed" their personal vision statements. One participant wrote: "I have a dream that I can live with passion, inspiring creativity, productivity and joy in myself and others." What employer wouldn't jump at the chance to hire someone with talent and passion like that?</p> <p>There are several key lessons to be learned from this experience. While Indiana Jones is an amazing character, he is only fictional, not the real thing. Waiting for a hero like him to bail us out may mean waiting forever-and unnecessarily. When people realize that the leader they are waiting for is within them, they become their own amazing hero. They can stand and face whatever life throws at them, confident in the knowledge of who they are as people and as leaders. From there, it seems a short step to inspiring a shared vision of what's possible, at work and in life.</p> <p>As I write this article, today is the last day our company exists as is. On Monday, those who stayed become employees of the new company, and I'm inspired just knowing that several of our very best people will be taking on new roles and leading new teams, having delved into The Five Leadership Practices®. I'm especially proud of each of them for taking the time to create their personal vision, as a cornerstone of those practices.</p> <p><strong>Christine Barnes</strong> works in Leadership and Development at a global level.</p>

               <!--<a name="june2008"></a>June 2008:  by Peter Alduino--> <p>If you have seen the reruns for the 1970's television detective series Columbo, or the subsequent made-for-TV movies, you'll remember that oftentimes just as frumpy, disheveled Lt. Columbo was finishing a conversation with a suspect and on his way out the door, he would invariably pause, put his index finger up to his forehead, turn back to the suspect, point his finger, and say, "Oh, by the way," and ask one last question. And it was the answers to those final oh-by-the-way questions that, when woven together, would ultimately help him solve the case.</p> <p>Curiosity is our determined internal sleuth that regularly seeks out clues, hints and data to satisfy the huge appetite in each one of us that has little taste for stasis or status quo, but prefers instead a plate with generous helpings of answers to our whos, whats, whens, wheres, whys, hows, and I-wonder-ifs!</p> <p>Even a casual glance around our offices or our homes provides overwhelming evidence of our insatiable curiosity. Substantial sectors of our global economy are designed, dedicated, and depend on creating and supporting technologies that feed our hunger for inquiries and answers, our need-to-know, 24/7/365.</p> <p>Individually, we spend enormous quantities of time typing queries into search engines, finding out the latest news on our web-enabled PDA, and keeping current by cell phone.</p> <p>In our various roles as leader-at work, at school, in our communities, even at home-we experiment, take risks, listen to diverse points of view, ask "what can we learn," when things do not go as expected, and search outside the formal boundaries of our organization for innovative ways to improve what we do.</p> <p>The data suggests that our curiosity is overwhelmingly focused on uncovering the answers to what is "out there."</p> <p>But what about what is "in here?"</p> <p>When was the last time you allowed yourself the time and the space to be curious about you? When did you last apply the same energy and determination with which you pursue answers to what is "out there" to the questions about what is "in here": Who am I? What do I stand for? What do I fundamentally believe about the meaning of our work, and the direction in which we are headed?</p> <p>If your honest answer to the question is something along the lines: "I don't do this, or at least not very much," or "I'm not sure," or "I've got a vague idea," or "I'd like to find out more," you are in good company.</p> <p>And that is why we devote the entire first day of the two-day The Leadership Challenge® Workshop to an exploration of leader. Leadership is, first and foremost, an internal exploration of who you are. With that foundation, we can then examine and fine-tune what you do.</p> <p>The first of the three prerequisites for a meaningful exploration of leadership is that you be curious—curious not about what is "out there," but curious about who is "in here."</p> <p>©Peter Alduino</p> <p><strong>Peter Alduino</strong> is President and Founder of Bridge Group Communications, LLC, a San Francisco Bay-Area based leadership-consulting practice providing comprehensive leadership development seminars.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Growth is a difficult challenge. It is not easy. And it typically never occurs as a single event. Rather, it is a process that happens over time. Although growth can be fast-and sometimes mandated-it is ultimately rooted in the power of choice. It may be an elective but the alternative is maintaining the status quo, or even shrinking.</p> <p>So how do we grow—in influence, in effectiveness, in skills? There is a clear and concise growth strategy outlined for us in The Leadership Challenge. Let's step through model to see its application in our everyday lives.</p> <p><strong>Step One:</strong> Establish some prioritized beliefs or values to understand our own commitment to development. The leadership practice of Model the Way provides the guidance we need to establish this list. With a little self-examination, we can pick the values we want to live by, and these values can serve to direct our motivation and define our calls to action.</p> <p><strong>Step Two:</strong> Identify and describe the future state we are trying to create. The leadership practice of Inspire a Shared Vision is designed to create this picture for us and to engage our constituents in the growth process. Any great growth strategy is best accomplished by enlisting some support from those around us, and these people want to know where we are trying to go and why. Supported with tools like metaphors, similes, word pictures, repetition, and intonation, we can create a compelling image in the eyes and minds of our constituents.</p> <p><strong>Step Three:</strong> Make a change of some kind. This leadership practice of Challenge the Process provides us with the ideas and suggestions to try something new. Experiment and learn from the experience. Whether it works or it doesn't, we can apply the learning and improve over time.</p> <p><strong>Step Four:</strong> Implement the leadership practice of Enable Others to Act. Here we are able to develop more cooperative relationships with those around us, building trust and trusting intentions while also creating more effective communications among our constituents. Growth is difficult but the more we engage and enlist those around us-with information and resources-our own actions and theirs will be enhanced.</p> <p><strong>Step Five:</strong> The very important and often overlooked leadership practice of Encourage the Heart. This is both the recognition and celebration of the small and large accomplishments we achieve along the developmental growth path. Increasing our awareness of what warrants recognition, and then making the praise or reward visible to others and to ourselves, bolsters our resilience during the growth process. Encouraging our own hearts for taking the steps needed for growth will foster our ongoing commitment to grow.</p> <p>In a world that is continually changing and evolving, our best option is to choose to grow-or risk being left behind as the world changes around us. Following the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® as outlined in The Leadership Challenge is our practical roadmap to growth.</p> <p>Are you ready? Are you ready to choose to GROW?</p> <p><strong>Craig Haptonstall</strong> is President and CEO of Leadership Mechanics LLC.

               <!--<a name="january2008"></a>January 2008:  by Jim Kouzes--> <p>The late John Gardner, leadership scholar and presidential advisor, once remarked, "Pity the leader caught between unloving critics and uncritical lovers." I'm quite taken by this observation. It should be on a poster that hangs over every leader's desk-or a screen saver on their computers-and it should be read and contemplated several times a day.</p> <p>None of us likes to hear the constant screeching of the harpies who have only foul things to say. At the same time, we never benefit from, nor truly believe, the sycophants whose flattery is so obviously aimed at gaining favor. To stay honest with ourselves, what we really need are "loving critics"-people who care deeply enough to give us honest feedback about how we're doing.</p> <p>According to research Barry Posner and I have conducted over the years, credibility is at the foundation of leadership. From a behavioral perspective, credibility is about "doing what you say you will do." But how can you do what you say if you don't know how you're doing? If you never ask for feedback on your behavior and on how your behavior affects how others are doing, how can you really expect to align your words and your actions over the long haul?</p> <p>There's solid evidence that the best leaders are highly attuned to what's going on inside of them as they are leading, as well as what's going on with others. They're very self-aware and they're very socially aware. They can tell in short order whether they've done something that has enabled someone to perform at a higher level or whether they've sent motivation heading south.</p> <p>Setting up a system for getting regular feedback (the equivalent of the dashboard) and paying attention to that feedback will help a leader more effectively move the organization forward. All leaders want to have a positive impact on performance. It's part of their legacy. The only way they can know if they're having the desired impact is to get regular feedback on how they're doing.</p> <p>In addition to the annual 360-degree assessment, try this the next time you're in a meeting. Begin by asking, "How am I doing?" More than likely you'll be greeted with stunned silence—a sure sign folks are not used to being asked this question by you (or anyone else) and are uncomfortable in responding. But if you wait long enough some brave soul may venture an honest response. When she or he does, immediately recognize him or her for showing some courage, and tell the rest of the group, "That's what we need more of around here. More loving critics."</p> <p><strong>Jim Kouzes</strong> is a highly regarded leadership scholar, experienced executive, and coauthor (with Barry Posner) of The Leadership Challenge. He also is Dean's Executive Professor of Leadership, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University and has been cited by The Wall Street Journal as one of the twelve best executive educators in the U.S.</p>

               <!--<a name="september2007"></a>September 2007: by Steve Houchin --> <p>For years we have stated that while management is an affair of the head, leadership is an affair of the heart. Today, neuroscience is proving us right!</p> <p>When we have a direct experience, nerve impulses travel first to the enteric nervous system—literally a second brain in our intestines—that produces an instant gut reaction (what we might call 'butterflies'). Next stop for the impulses are the baroreceptors in the heart, or the third brain. The brain in the heart communicates to the rest of the body in a number of ways, one of which is a chemical messenger in the hormonal system called atrial peptide, a principle driver of motivated behavior (the goal of every leader!). Neural messages travel to the brain in our heads to be "thought about" after they have been sensed and interpreted by the intestines and the heart.</p> <p>What does this mean for leaders? First, whenever you confront important issues and before deciding on a course of action, ask yourself what your gut and heart are telling you in addition to what your head might think. Purposeful, committed action requires an alignment between your head and heart.</p> <p>Second, messages to constituents must be connected to the heart and gut, reflecting your true feelings. Since behavior is so heavily influenced by what we feel, any perceived disconnect between words and real feelings often makes us appear untrustworthy and damages our credibility—the essential foundation of effective leadership. Constituents believe in the authenticity of leadership when true feelings and beliefs, spoken and written communications, and actions are all in sync.</p> <p>Third, important messages about vision, strategy, or change must first invoke a positive feeling in the guts and hearts of constituents. If not, your words likely will be interpreted negatively by the message centers in their brains, resulting in the all-too-familiar "resistance to change" syndrome.</p> <p>Finding your unique leadership voice-one that consistently inspires high levels of performance by constituents—is a significant "leadership challenge" but one worthy of your best efforts. One way to get started is to reflect on the following thought questions: </p> 
               <ul> 
                <li>Do you characterize yourself as a rational decision maker or someone who tends to go with your gut feeling? The next time you are making an important decision, listen to what both your gut and brain may be telling you and try to bring them into alignment. </li> 
                <li>Am I an authentic leader? Do my constituents really know what I feel and believe what they hear and see? Is there anything about me that I could change to improve my credibility in the eyes of my followers? </li> 
                <li>Recall the last important message you received from your leader(s). Did you understand, agree, or even care? Did you enthusiastically take the appropriate action called for? If yes, what about the leader or what did the leader say or do that inspired your positive response? How can you use this experience to improve your own communication? If no, what specifically can you learn from the experience to avoid or change? </li> 
               </ul> <p>Successful leaders have discovered that they must first listen to their own heart, be comfortable with who they are, and ensure that their words and actions are consistent with both what they believe and their authentic selves. Only then can they can win the hearts and minds of their constituents.</p> <strong>Steve Houchin</strong>, an 18-year veteran of corporate HR and executive leadership, is an owner and Managing Partner of International Leadership Associates, the leadership development firm that has presented The Leadership Challenge® Workshop to organizations, large and small, for over 15 years.

               <!-- September 2007 --> <p><strong>Q: How can I really ever hope to get better as a leader, with all the emails, voicemails, meetings, and everything else on my plate? I don't know how I can ever do it all. </strong></p> <p><strong>A: </strong>The management sides of our jobs are endlessly screaming at us. And we all know why. It is those management activities that are most closely measured, reviewed, and valued. And importantly, they also are the basis of our pay. No one gets a free pass on achieving today's results. And the primary focus of our management responsibility is just that: delivering results each and every day.</p> <p>As leaders, you also must tackle the added responsibility of preparing the organization to change, grow, and prosper over the long haul. That means you have to be continually building future capabilities while consistently making the monthly numbers.</p> <p>Successful leaders simply cannot avoid this seemingly competing set of demands. That's why we call it the leadership challenge, not the leadership cakewalk! But the following ideas might help you start making progress in resolving what often seems like a conflict between your role as a manager and as a leader. </p> 
               <ol> 
                <li>Check your personal level of commitment to your own growth as a leader. How much are you willing to stretch? Are you prepared to deal with some anxious and uncomfortable moments? What or how much are you willing to sacrifice? You need to be committed because you already know how difficult it will be to change how you work in an overscheduled, "everything is a priority" environment. </li> 
                <li>If you are committed, do something immediately to directly invest in your leadership development. Think about this: if you desperately wanted to learn to fly a plane, you would enroll in Ground School, as your first step, and then you would make time to attend. You would likely stick with it if you paid the full tuition upfront (rather than on a per-session basis). So consider how to apply this same approach to your own leadership development. Putting some 'skin' in the development game right away makes it harder to back away. One immediate action you could take would be to complete the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI), to more fully understand the areas in which you have proven strengths and those that may be derailing your efforts. You cannot grow without valid feedback, and if you are indeed committed, you cannot ignore it. </li> 
                <li>Let other people know your intentions and ask them to help you. This is so important. And yet, it is so often overlooked. Developing your leadership should not be a secret, which you feel you must pursue independently and alone. Always remember that people with whom you interact directly benefit as you become a more effective leader. They probably want to help you, if you will let them. Finding a confidant, mentor, or coach will also be helpful. </li> 
                <li>Finally, identify a first small win that you want to achieve and remain focused on it. Bite-size pieces to start might include: 
                 <ul> 
                  <li>allocate one hour per week, allowing no interruptions, so that you can think about and consider new ideas </li> 
                  <li>devote 30 uninterrupted minutes each month to spend with each of your direct reports, listening to their ideas, current struggles, and aspirations; become more closely connected with them </li> 
                  <li>pick 2 people from other departments to have lunch with each month in order to start breaking down silos </li> 
                 </ul> </li> 
               </ol> <p>One thing is for certain: in order to find the time to fulfill your current management obligations and still become a better leader, you must change. Sometimes you must change what you do, which means saying "No" to work that might be comfortable but is simply not valuable enough to keep doing. Do not underestimate how hard that is to do. And often you also must change how you do your work. For example, spend 10 less minutes in reviewing results with people and devote it to brainstorming ideas instead. Set meeting times for 20 minutes or 40 minutes, vs. the standard half or full hour. Or start out your meetings by genuinely recognizing the efforts of people deserving credit, then use the remainder for your management work.</p> <p>Be fully committed to your growth as a leader and you will find many creative ways to free up the time to lead.</p> <p><strong>Steve Coats </strong>is a managing partner and co-owner of International Leadership Associates, a leadership development education and consulting firm.

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Isn't it amazing the way important themes emerge in different places, simultaneously? In late March, twenty of us were sitting at tables in the St. Louis Hyatt Regency talking about how to get out of the box, just about the same time that authorities in New York were deliberating whether to exhume the body of the famous escape artist, Harry Houdini.</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Houdini">Harry Houdini</a> still makes headlines 80 years after his death because he appeared to be able to defy the limits that frustrate ordinary human beings. He did what the rest of us want to do but usually can't figure out how to do—to free ourselves from constraints (the exhumation notwithstanding, of course). Few have come close to matching what Houdini seemed to have been able to accomplish.</p> <p>Back over at the Hyatt, our discussion followed this same theme, but with a significant departure. We had gathered to talk with Jim Kouzes, an author and lecturer on the topic of leadership development. Leaders are the people who help us get out of the limiting confines of our present situations and move purposefully toward a vision of a brighter future. But the ability to do so is not the private reserve of a select few superhuman men and women, Kouzes said. In fact, leadership requires a set of skills and abilities that can be mastered by almost anyone—given proper training and the opportunity and discipline to practice, practice, practice.</p> <p>There went one illusion.</p> <p>Here's another one that Kouzes and his co-author Barry Posner dispel in their 2006 publication <a href="http://www.wiley.com/buy/0787982962">A Leader's Legacy</a>. "The future doesn't just belong to the leaders. It's not just the leader's vision that leaders are accountable for enacting. Leadership isn't about selling <em>your</em> vision; it's about articulating the people's vision."</p> <p>"OK then," said one of the senior HR leaders in attendance. "But what do we do when we invite our people to participate in planning for the future of our organization, but they keep coming up with the same old ideas? It's like they are stuck in the box; how can we help them get out?"</p> <p>Kouzes' response may be a little surprising-becoming forward-focused doesn't necessarily result from sitting through leadership development courses or visioning sessions, as we traditionally think of them. Our employees need a steady, sustained diet of things to read and opportunities to talk that expose them to different ideas and vantage points that stretch them and gently push them out of their comfort zones. A broadened view of the present leads to an expanded sense of the future.</p> <p>In <strong>A Leader's Legacy</strong>, he puts it this way. "As counterintuitive as it might seem, the best place to start creating the future is by being more mindful in the present. Our failure at being forward-looking may result more from our mindlessness in the present than from any other factor. We operate on automatic pilot, not really noticing what's going on around us, believing we know everything we need to know, viewing the world from established categories, and operating from a single point of view."</p> <p>This last bit about established categories and a single point of view really hit home with me, in part because of an experience I had immediately before the gathering at the Hyatt. Thanks to my uncanny knack for getting lost, I had gone to the wrong end of the hotel when I arrived, and I wandered the whole length of a concourse packed with corporate training sessions before confirming that I was in the wrong place. I'm not one to be deterred by an occasional blind alley, but by the time I made it out, my shoulders were scrunched inward and my gaze was fixed firmly on the floor. It weighs you down to try to decipher row after row of signs written in acronyms of bold capital letters, with hyphens and decimal points in unfamiliar places. Such is the language of people who talk only among themselves, labels on the boxes we put ourselves in. If you've ever been in a situation where everyone around you was speaking jargon that you didn't understand, you can probably relate to my incredible shrinking feeling.</p> <p>This is one of the things we're working on through <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2007/02/19/daily57.html">WorkforceStLouis2.0</a>. We strive to bring business leaders together to find common language with which to articulate and communicate a shared vision of a bright future for St. Louis - a metro region competing in a global talent marketplace in which agility, flexibility, critical thinking, team-work, and leadership are essential tools for getting ahead. If Jim Kouzes is right, then the key to anticipating this future lies in a closer examination of where we are right now. It would be amazing if, like Houdini, we have everything we need already in our grasp-we just need to look extremely carefully to see it.</p> <p><strong>Blair Forlaw</strong> is the Director of WorkforceStLouis2.0, a program administered by the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL).

               <!--HTMLRAW--> <p>Over the years, I have asked hundreds of people to identify role models who have been successful in Challenging the Process within organizations, and then to describe how those people were able to succeed while so many others struggle. From this research, I have created a list of six factors for raising the probability of success in the difficult work of Challenging the Process. I hope you find them useful in your own efforts.</p> <p><strong>1. Respect the Culture</strong></p> <p>How would you like it if someone barged into your home and started lecturing you on how to raise your kids better? Most parents would be offended to some degree. In organizations, similar resistance can occur to those who Challenge the Process. You must be careful in how you confront and challenge accepted processes, systems, or behavioral norms.</p> <p>It is crucial that you understand and appreciate the environment in which you are attempting to challenge the way something is currently done. You just cannot barge in and criticize the other people for their use of a process you believe to be inefficient or archaic, or send the message that you are the savior of the organization. Simply because you believe you have a better way of doing something does not mean that it is better in everyone's eyes.</p> <p>Respecting the culture does not mean caving in and demonstrating unwillingness to push back with innovative ideas and changes. It does mean recognizing the past accomplishments of the people in the organization and not belittling those efforts because of a system or process that is no longer serving its purpose in the best way today. In order to be most effective, you need to be mindful that there are appropriate ways to have your "Challenging" (vs. "condescending") voice heard.</p> <p>In spite of how well an organization is performing, there will always be an aspect of immense importance that is not performing well. It might be a compensation system, an internal overhead allocation process, the way new people are on-boarded, the means by which customer information is gathered, or a host of other processes or procedures. Leaders are willing to step up and take responsibility for addressing these opportunity areas. And they realize and communicate that working to improve certain processes which may have flaws, does not imply that the entire organization is broken or poorly managed.</p> <p><strong>2. Understand the Process You are Challenging.</strong></p> <p>Resist the urge to Challenge Processes you know nothing about.</p> <p>This leadership practice requires homework. A process can have many parts that touch many people in many ways. A change to one part of a process can have unknown or unintended consequences in another part. You must understand a process in its current state, so you can determine the impact your changes will have. Remember that a solution to one problem often creates many new problems.</p> <p>In addition, you must expect that you will likely offend or upset others when you initiate change. The quote "reform is usually not popular with those who are in charge of that which needs reform" is something to think about. Other peoples' reputations may be tied to the original process you are trying to change, or they might be most effective in their work with the way the process functions today. You need to know who may be negatively impacted by your proposed changes in order to figure out how to ultimately earn their support.</p> <p><strong>3. Build a</strong></p></span>
