tml-version=\"2\" --><p>“For two and a half years I worked at Starbucks, at a hotel, at a restaurant, got my real estate license, and worked as a lifeguard, trying to figure out what to do. I moved back home, retook the SATs, and read a bunch of books to try to figure things out. I read <em>What Color Is Your Parachute?<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Who Moved My Cheese?&nbsp;<\/em>and took several Myers-Briggs tests. I pursued any avenue I could think of, but none of that advice seemed like it was relevant for me where I was in my life.” So a young woman named Maria told me as I was writing my book <em>The Big Picture<\/em>.<\/p><p>I’m no ordinary self-help book writer. I’m an applied sociologist in the School of Human Ecology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.&nbsp;I wrote my doctoral dissertation on the self-help industry. I’ve studied who buys self-help books, what advice is popular, and why. I’ve crafted rigorous content analyses of bestselling titles to uncover the formula of their success. I catalogued the advice of hundreds of guides to find the ones that had real research behind them (and the ones that were mostly made-up garbage). I’ve explored the assumptions, sociology, and psychology of personal improvement. And along the way, I’ve combed through the advice to find the nuggets of enduring wisdom in these popular paperbacks.<\/p><p>If you’re in school or recently out, you probably feel like your real life hasn’t yet begun. Yes, you are busy—taking classes, working a part-time job, volunteering, putting time and energy into extracurricular activities, feeling caught up in the drama of friendships and relationships—but somehow it all seems like a practice round for real life, which will start . . . later . . . when you’re an adult. Right?<\/p><p>That was my line of thinking for many years. I was going to be an adult after I graduated from school and had a job, a house, and a spouse. Then real life would begin. Then I’d have to take things more seriously. But now? In school? Not yet. I was on the roller coaster of life, putting in the effort just to chug-chug-chug up the tracks.<\/p><p>After college I went straight to graduate school. For another few years, I still felt like I was putting off real life. I watched my friends live their real lives—turning their potential energy into kinetic energy, their day-to-day decisions moving them forward—while I just hung out in school, not actually living.<\/p><p>So I thought.<\/p><p>Research has found that between the ages of seventeen and thirty, we have a distinctive way of making meaning and laying the groundwork for our futures. According to Sharon Daloz Parks, there are three steps to such meaning-making: 1. Become aware that you are creating your own reality. 2. Embark on a personal search for truth. 3. Cultivate a capacity to respond and act in ways that are satisfying to you and that you feel are just.<\/p><p>In my own case, I needed to take that first step. What’s more, I encourage you to take it right now. Understand that you are creating your own reality and co-creating it with the world around you. You are producing and directing the movie of your own life. Wherever you are, you are living real life right now. What you do and say matters. The choices you make have long-term consequences. You might not feel like an adult yet, but you’re making choices like one—and the consequences are certainly real enough.<\/p><p>One day in my early twenties I realized, with the force of a boulder dropping from the sky, that this was my real life. Two of my close friends had attempted suicide. I was immersed in big existential questions.<\/p><p>I came to understand that the weeks and months were passing by, and I could choose how to treat them—either as some separate and unreal time horizon or as my real life. I could keep screaming inside, or I could take action.<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci020013579000251c\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"<a href=&quot;http://www.erinwoodyphotography.com/#our-story&quot;>Erin Woody<\/a>\"><\/div><p>If you’ve wondered what you are here to do and what the point of your life is, welcome to the human race: It’s the number-one question that people of all ages want to answer. A few years back, <em>USA Today<\/em> asked adults what they would ask God or a Supreme Being if they could get a direct and immediate answer. The most popular question from the list they offered wasn’t “Will I have life after death?” (that was number two) or “Why do bad things happen?” (number three) The top question adults would ask a God or Supreme Being was, “What’s my purpose here?” Think about that. People are more interested in their purposes now than what will happen to them after their deaths.<\/p><p>I replicated this question in a survey of nearly one thousand young adults, mostly clustered in the sixteen-to-thirty age range, and the results came out the same way. Whether you think that purpose and meaning come from connecting to something that is bigger than you—something that transcends yourself—like God or a quest for justice or beauty, or that purpose and meaning come from pursuing goals that are valuable and important, your journey to find your purpose is an adventure to seek something intrinsically important.<\/p><p>In the last few decades, psychology has given a lot of attention to the study of happiness and well-being. In a nutshell, research has found that the things we think will make us happy—money, stuff, new relationships, different environments—actually do little to affect our happiness. The tough stuff we do in pursuit of a purposeful life is what’s necessary to have good mental health down the line.<\/p><p>Why? Because there are different kinds of happiness, research finds. There’s happiness that’s about pleasure and happiness that’s about meaning. While new toys and fun experiences can bring us pleasure, it’s personal purpose in the service of a larger vision that brings long-term satisfaction. That’s why when psychologists talk about good mental health, it’s usually defined to include benefits that give a person the feeling that there is purpose in and meaning to life. To be a mature person, then, means having a clear understanding of life’s purpose, a sense of directedness, and intentionality.<\/p><p>Living purposefully means finding the realm where doing what you love—doing what makes you happy, what comes naturally to you, the kinds of things that make you excited and lose track of time—meets a need that is greater than your own individual pleasure.<\/p><p>Your purpose isn’t to get a certain type of job. It isn’t to marry the right kind of person or have a house in the best neighborhood. It’s also probably not about selling all your worldly possessions and becoming a missionary (although for a few that might be the path), and it’s certainly not about saying no to fun.<\/p><p>Living purposefully isn’t about glamorous work or important sounding titles. Seemingly mundane jobs can be full of meaning when approached from a purpose mindset. So can high-profile positions that earn lots of money and things you do outside of paid work. Your purpose might be fueled by faith, or it could be a secular pursuit. And since you are starting to think about these concepts at a relatively young age, your purpose will probably change over time, too.<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci02001375900027ca\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"<a href=&quot;http://www.erinwoodyphotography.com/#our-story&quot;>Erin Woody<\/a>\"><\/div><p>Purpose is a key ingredient in achieving the good life, argues bestselling purpose author Richard Leider. He defines the good life as being in the right place, with the right people, doing the right work, on purpose. “Living on purpose is a choice,” writes Leider in <em>The Power of Purpose<\/em>. “It is a way of living in which you are aware each moment of each day that you have a choice about what to say and do and how to be. Every situation presents you with a new purpose moment—an opportunity to show up on purpose—and you are conscious of the opportunities.” In other words, living on purpose means becoming aware of who you are and what you are bringing to life each day as you create your good life.<\/p><p>I don’t have a hidden agenda to steer you into a do-goody profession. I do, however, believe that your purpose will be bigger than just making yourself happy.<\/p><p>As it happens, your personality is shaped more during your twenties than any other time in adulthood, and the experiences you have and the choices you make during these years will have a disproportionate influence on the life that you will lead. Indeed, according to psychologist Meg Jay’s inspirational book, <em>The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter—And How to Make the Most of Them<\/em>, 80 percent of life’s most significant events take place by the age of thirty-five, so to leave thoughtful consideration of these questions until a midlife crisis seems backward. Your late-teens and twenties are the years when you are creating yourself in relationship to the world, and it is rightfully a time for asking big questions and formulating worthy dreams.<\/p><p>Just as kids effortlessly learn whatever language they hear before age five—but struggle to do so as they get older—your young-adult years are a window of opportunity to create the life you want by making conscious choices about what’s meaningful to you . . . now.<\/p><p>Studies find that people who set and achieve goals in their twenties are more likely to report a sense of purpose, mastery, agency, and well-being in their thirties, but you don’t have to lock yourself into one particular path or singular purpose for the rest of your life. Instead, research suggests that getting into a purpose mindset—identifying how your specific talents and values intersect with the needs of others—is the first step toward living a purposeful life.<\/p><p><em>Christine B.

             <p>“For two and a half years I worked at Starbucks, at a hotel, at a restaurant, got my real estate license, and worked as a lifeguard, trying to figure out what to do. I moved back home, retook the SATs, and read a bunch of books to try to figure things out. I read <em>What Color Is Your Parachute?</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Who Moved My Cheese?&nbsp;</em>and took several Myers-Briggs tests. I pursued any avenue I could think of, but none of that advice seemed like it was relevant for me where I was in my life.” So a young woman named Maria told me as I was writing my book <em>The Big Picture</em>.</p>

             <p>I’m no ordinary self-help book writer. I’m an applied sociologist in the School of Human Ecology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.&nbsp;I wrote my doctoral dissertation on the self-help industry. I’ve studied who buys self-help books, what advice is popular, and why. I’ve crafted rigorous content analyses of bestselling titles to uncover the formula of their success. I catalogued the advice of hundreds of guides to find the ones that had real research behind them (and the ones that were mostly made-up garbage). I’ve explored the assumptions, sociology, and psychology of personal improvement. And along the way, I’ve combed through the advice to find the nuggets of enduring wisdom in these popular paperbacks.</p>
             <p>If you’re in school or recently out, you probably feel like your real life hasn’t yet begun. Yes, you are busy—taking classes, working a part-time job, volunteering, putting time and energy into extracurricular activities, feeling caught up in the drama of friendships and relationships—but somehow it all seems like a practice round for real life, which will start . . . later . . . when you’re an adult. Right?</p>

             <p>That was my line of thinking for many years. I was going to be an adult after I graduated from school and had a job, a house, and a spouse. Then real life would begin. Then I’d have to take things more seriously. But now? In school? Not yet. I was on the roller coaster of life, putting in the effort just to chug-chug-chug up the tracks.</p>

             <p>After college I went straight to graduate school. For another few years, I still felt like I was putting off real life. I watched my friends live their real lives—turning their potential energy into kinetic energy, their day-to-day decisions moving them forward—while I just hung out in school, not actually living.</p>
             <p>So I thought.</p>
             <p>Research has found that between the ages of seventeen and thirty, we have a distinctive way of making meaning and laying the groundwork for our futures. According to Sharon Daloz Parks, there are three steps to such meaning-making: 1. Become aware that you are creating your own reality. 2. Embark on a personal search for truth. 3. Cultivate a capacity to respond and act in ways that are satisfying to you and that you feel are just.</p>
             <p>In my own case, I needed to take that first step. What’s more, I encourage you to take it right now. Understand that you are creating your own reality and co-creating it with the world around you. You are producing and directing the movie of your own life. Wherever you are, you are living real life right now. What you do and say matters. The choices you make have long-term consequences. You might not feel like an adult yet, but you’re making choices like one—and the consequences are certainly real enough.</p>
             <p>One day in my early twenties I realized, with the force of a boulder dropping from the sky, that this was my real life. Two of my close friends had attempted suicide. I was immersed in big existential questions.</p>

             <p>I came to understand that the weeks and months were passing by, and I could choose how to treat them—either as some separate and unreal time horizon or as my real life. I could keep screaming inside, or I could take action.</p>

             <p>If you’ve wondered what you are here to do and what the point of your life is, welcome to the human race: It’s the number-one question that people of all ages want to answer. A few years back, <em>USA Today</em> asked adults what they would ask God or a Supreme Being if they could get a direct and immediate answer. The most popular question from the list they offered wasn’t “Will I have life after death?” (that was number two) or “Why do bad things happen?” (number three) The top question adults would ask a God or Supreme Being was, “What’s my purpose here?” Think about that. People are more interested in their purposes now than what will happen to them after their deaths.</p>
             <p>I replicated this question in a survey of nearly one thousand young adults, mostly clustered in the sixteen-to-thirty age range, and the results came out the same way. Whether you think that purpose and meaning come from connecting to something that is bigger than you—something that transcends yourself—like God or a quest for justice or beauty, or that purpose and meaning come from pursuing goals that are valuable and important, your journey to find your purpose is an adventure to seek something intrinsically important.</p>

             <p>In the last few decades, psychology has given a lot of attention to the study of happiness and well-being. In a nutshell, research has found that the things we think will make us happy—money, stuff, new relationships, different environments—actually do little to affect our happiness. The tough stuff we do in pursuit of a purposeful life is what’s necessary to have good mental health down the line.</p>

             <p>Why? Because there are different kinds of happiness, research finds. There’s happiness that’s about pleasure and happiness that’s about meaning. While new toys and fun experiences can bring us pleasure, it’s personal purpose in the service of a larger vision that brings long-term satisfaction. That’s why when psychologists talk about good mental health, it’s usually defined to include benefits that give a person the feeling that there is purpose in and meaning to life. To be a mature person, then, means having a clear understanding of life’s purpose, a sense of directedness, and intentionality.</p>
             <p>Living purposefully means finding the realm where doing what you love—doing what makes you happy, what comes naturally to you, the kinds of things that make you excited and lose track of time—meets a need that is greater than your own individual pleasure.</p>
             <p>Your purpose isn’t to get a certain type of job. It isn’t to marry the right kind of person or have a house in the best neighborhood. It’s also probably not about selling all your worldly possessions and becoming a missionary (although for a few that might be the path), and it’s certainly not about saying no to fun.</p>

             <p>Living purposefully isn’t about glamorous work or important sounding titles. Seemingly mundane jobs can be full of meaning when approached from a purpose mindset. So can high-profile positions that earn lots of money and things you do outside of paid work. Your purpose might be fueled by faith, or it could be a secular pursuit. And since you are starting to think about these concepts at a relatively young age, your purpose will probably change over time, too.</p>

             <p>Purpose is a key ingredient in achieving the good life, argues bestselling purpose author Richard Leider. He defines the good life as being in the right place, with the right people, doing the right work, on purpose. “Living on purpose is a choice,” writes Leider in <em>The Power of Purpose</em>. “It is a way of living in which you are aware each moment of each day that you have a choice about what to say and do and how to be. Every situation presents you with a new purpose moment—an opportunity to show up on purpose—and you are conscious of the opportunities.” In other words, living on purpose means becoming aware of who you are and what you are bringing to life each day as you create your good life.</p>
             <p>I don’t have a hidden agenda to steer you into a do-goody profession. I do, however, believe that your purpose will be bigger than just making yourself happy.</p>

             <p>As it happens, your personality is shaped more during your twenties than any other time in adulthood, and the experiences you have and the choices you make during these years will have a disproportionate influence on the life that you will lead. Indeed, according to psychologist Meg Jay’s inspirational book, <em>The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter—And How to Make the Most of Them</em>, 80 percent of life’s most significant events take place by the age of thirty-five, so to leave thoughtful consideration of these questions until a midlife crisis seems backward. Your late-teens and twenties are the years when you are creating yourself in relationship to the world, and it is rightfully a time for asking big questions and formulating worthy dreams.</p>
             <p>Just as kids effortlessly learn whatever language they hear before age five—but struggle to do so as they get older—your young-adult years are a window of opportunity to create the life you want by making conscious choices about what’s meaningful to you . . . now.</p>

             <p>Studies find that people who set and achieve goals in their twenties are more likely to report a sense of purpose, mastery, agency, and well-being in their thirties, but you don’t have to lock yourself into one particular path or singular purpose for the rest of your life. Instead, research suggests that getting into a purpose mindset—identifying how your specific talents and values intersect with the needs of others—is the first step toward living a purposeful life.</p>

Almost universally, this&nbsp;“balance”&nbsp;really means “work less.” The&nbsp;general theory is that we’re all overworked. Happiness, we assume, requires scaling back.<\/p><p>Because I spend my life studying records of how people spend their time, I have a slightly different perspective on this. When forced to keep track of their hours, many people find that they work fewer hours than they think. Indeed, the more people think they work, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2011/06/art3full.pdf\">the more wrong they tend to be<\/a>.<\/p><p>There are 168 hours in a week. Someone sleeping eight hours a night (fifty-six per week) would have 112 hours left for other things. Dividing those 112 hours in half, you find that you’d need to be working at least fifty-six hours per week in order for “work” and “life” to be in perfect balance. The vast majority of people work fewer hours than this, so cutting back at work would actually only further the imbalance in favor of life. That’s a perfectly great place to be, but it does suggest a problem with the “balance” metaphor.<\/p><p>So I’d suggest a different approach. Instead of resolving to achieve work–life balance, it’s better to ask this question: What do I want to do more of with my nonworking time?<\/p><p>When I ask people this question, certain answers come up a lot. People want to exercise more. They want to read more. They want to get together with friends. They want to volunteer. This is what people are talking about when they say they want to be “balanced.” We presume that making space for these enjoyable activities requires working less, but the truth is that there are plenty of people with challenging jobs who exercise, read, and have meaningful relationships with their friends, family, and community. <\/p><p>Instead, making space for these things requires being better stewards of time. It means resolving to spend nonworking time on higher-value things, rather than easy things, such as turning on the TV. The best way to do that is to be a bit more strategic about the 168 hours you have each week. <\/p><p>For the past few years, every Friday afternoon when I’m too tired to start anything new, I’ve taken a few minutes to think through the week ahead. I make a three-category priority list: career, relationships, self. Using a three-category list reminds me that there should be something in all three categories! It doesn’t have to be much, but listing that I want to go for a long run on the weekend with a friend, set up a date night with my husband, and make banana bread with my daughter nudges me to look at the calendar for the week ahead and plot these things in. There is always time. Even someone working seventy hours a week and sleeping eight hours per night would still have forty-two hours for other things. <\/p><p>Making sure that these nonworking hours are filled with worthwhile, enjoyable activities is the key to making life feel balanced—far more so than adjusting the actual number of hours we work. <\/p><p>So this year, pull out that pad of paper, and get ready to pencil things in on your calendar. Because clearing your schedule isn’t the key to finding work–life balance. Filling it up more intentionally is.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"http://juliahembreephoto.portfoliobox.me/\">Julia Hembree

Join us as we meet a new woman each month.<\/em><\/p><p>  In the political world, shouting is often the best way to get someone’s attention. So when Katie Biber—a political operative who worked as an election lawyer and then as general counsel for Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign—left Washington for the West Coast chill of Silicon Valley, there was, needless to say, a bit of an adjustment period. <br tml-linebreak=\"true\"><\/p><p>But Biber, a Harvard Law graduate who last year was named one of <em><a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g3230/the-new-guard-influential-women/\">Marie Claire<\/a><\/em><a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g3230/the-new-guard-influential-women/\">’s 50 most influential women<\/a> in America, wasn’t deterred. In 2013, she landed a job as senior counsel at a little-known startup called Airbnb. In the two years she spent there, she watched the company grow into a place where she says her East Coast friends “would kill to work.” Last year, she made the jump to another booming company, Thumbtack, which helps connect small business owners, such as landscapers or piano teachers, to people who need their services. <\/p><p>And this is just Biber’s day job. Biber and her husband are also raising their two boys (ages five and seven) to be “full-fledged individuals with opinions and thoughts and concerns about the world.”<\/p><p>Biber spoke with us about her mid-career transition, being 50/50 partners in marriage,  and her plan to strand her kids in San Francisco (don’t be alarmed—it makes way more sense than you’d think).<\/p><p><strong>Rebecca Nelson: You had been in politics for 15 years before getting into tech. What spurred you to make the switch?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Katie Biber: <\/strong>After the 2012 campaign was over, for the first time in my life I felt like I was done working in politics, at least as a full-time vocation. I hadn’t felt that way after any other cycle, so it was a pretty profound realization to know that I would be okay with not spending the next two years preparing for the 2014 election, and then positioning myself to participate in 2016. My husband and I ended up moving to San Francisco because he had a job out here. I pretty quickly decided that I really wanted to work for Airbnb, which my husband and I had been using since the early days, back when it was couch surfing and not a household name by any stretch. So I reached out to the newly-hired general counsel there and kind of stalked and bothered her on LinkedIn until she agreed to talk to me.<\/p><p><strong>RN: Tell me about the decision to move from the East Coast to the Bay Area. What was that like for your family?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB: <\/strong>It was a difficult one. I had spent my entire career working on the East Coast, working in politics, working primarily in D.C., and I felt comfortable. I had friends. I had a political and career network. I had all of the trappings of comfort and knew that I could find my next job in Washington in politics or at a law firm fairly easily. At the same time, my husband had spent virtually the last ten years being supportive of my career. He could have come out to San Francisco following graduation from business school, or graduation from college, and worked in tech way back when. It seemed like it was the right time for him.<\/p><p>All things being equal, D.C. is a great place for me to work. But surprisingly, San Francisco&nbsp;is an even more fulfilling and interesting place to be. So I’m glad that I took the chance and wasn’t so single-mindedly focused on staying in Washington after 2012.<\/p><p><strong>RN: How is it more interesting and fulfilling?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>After a while working in politics and working in government, you begin to feel like you’re fighting over the pieces of a pie that somebody else has created. I wanted to get into the private sector and actually take part in baking the pie. It’s a very fulfilling thing to help grow something from nothing and watch people use the thing you created to help make ends meet, and to empower themselves to build their own small businesses.<\/p><p><strong>RN: Your job kept your family on the East Coast for years, and your husband’s brought you to the West Coast. How do you balance two ambitious people<\/strong><strong>’<\/strong><strong>s careers in a marriage?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB: <\/strong>We truly have a 50/50 partnership, for which I am incredibly grateful. He is as much of a parent to our children as I am. He is as much of a contributor to our household as I am. And I don’t think any of the things that I have accomplished would have been possible if he viewed our relationship differently, or expected something other than that from me. And as a result, I sometimes get a little bit irritated when I hear people talking about work/life balance as exclusively the province of women. My husband cares as much as I do about getting to spend time with our&nbsp;children­—about&nbsp;having work he’s passionate about, but also being able to&nbsp;be there for our family. There’s nothing unique about that desire. It applies to men just as much as it applies to women. I strive to be as supportive of his career as he has been of mine, and the only way it works is to have the kind of very equal partnership that we have.<\/p><p><strong>RN: What’s the hardest part about your job?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>I have learned that you cannot torture yourself over every single decision you make. My work only very rarely is going to hinge on one or two make-or-break choices. It’s a culmination of thousands of pieces of advice I give, thousands of choices I make, and if I make the right call 90 percent of the time, that’s a pretty excellent track record. I always tell newbie general counsels,&nbsp;“The hardest thing that you will ever have to do in this job is get through that initial paralysis of having to make dozens and dozens of choices every single day. You have to accept the fact that you are not perfect.”<\/p><p><strong>RN: When you joined Airbnb, what surprised you most about the tech world that you didn<\/strong><strong>’<\/strong><strong>t expect?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>Unlike in politics, you can’t yell your way to respect with the people around you. I believe it was Margaret Thatcher who said,&nbsp;“Being powerful is like being a lady. If you have&nbsp;to tell people you are, you aren’t.”&nbsp;That absolutely applies in this context. You have to earn the respect that people have for you. You have to demonstrate that you’re worthy of it through your actions and your contributions. And you have to be respectful to everybody around you.<\/p><p>I have also learned to listen a little bit better than maybe I did in politics, when you got attention by jumping up and down and yelling and just talking louder than the other person. The chief legal officer at Airbnb gave me some excellent advice before I started this job: She told me to spend the first several months just listening to people. It is really hard advice to follow, but it is very good advice. I try to employ it whenever I’m tackling a new issue or thinking through something with someone. You can very easily shut down what would otherwise be incredibly interesting dialogue if you’re the first person to talk. So I strive&nbsp;never&nbsp;to be the first person who talks. I fail often, because it’s my natural proclivity, but I strive.<\/p><p><strong>RN: That’s good counsel for anyone. What's the best advice that you<\/strong><strong>’<\/strong><strong>ve ever gotten, either career-wise or life-wise?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>You should not be afraid of failure. A friend once told me that everybody should be fired early in their career so they can see that their life isn’t over. And I think there’s a lot of truth to that. I often think about ways that I can encourage my own children to try things that they are going to fail at. I actually have this crazy dream—you’re going to laugh at this probably—of someday starting a problem-solving camp. It would be for eight- to ten-year-olds in San Francisco, would involve two or three weeks of free-range play in Golden Gate Park, and would be capped by giving each of them $10, dropping them off in a completely unfamiliar neighborhood with a bus map, and telling them to get home. It’s those sorts of opportunities that are most helpful to someone’s growth and problem solving skills.<\/p><p><strong>RN: What’s a time you felt like you failed, and how did you get past it? <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>Oh, man. I’ve had many failures in life. I think perhaps the most amusing, in retrospect, was this internship I desperately wanted at the White House in 2001. More than wanting it, I felt that I was entitled to have this internship. And when I didn’t get it—and to this day, I remember where I was sitting when I received the call—I was so crushed. I completely lost perspective. I spent several days pitying myself, and I thought that this was going to be so crucial to my career as a young lawyer that I might as well just throw it all away now. As it turns out, I had a great summer doing something else entirely.<\/p><p>Nothing is ever as bad as it seems. And who you become as a person, ethically and morally, depends upon how you react to things that happen. You normally can’t change those things. But you can change how you react to them.<\/p><p>And to speak of additional advice, one of the things that I often say to people is you have to understand what your priorities are before you get into something, or at the commencement of your career. And you have to base your choices around those priorities, whether it’s your religion, your family, your ambition, your desire for material reward, or your health. Those things all compete against one another. You can’t let circumstances make choices for you. Otherwise, you’re going to look in the mirror in ten years and you’re going to hate what you’ve become.<\/p><p><strong>RN: We were just talking about professional failure, but you’ve had so many successes in your career. What’s been the proudest moment in your personal life?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>When I was a kid, and I would hear adults say, “My child is my greatest accomplishment,”&nbsp;I can quite clearly remember thinking,&nbsp;“I am not an accomplishment. I am a person.”&nbsp;But it’s&nbsp;my family, it’s my children. There are so many things that they do, whether it’s something they say in the morning that’s funny, or a thoughtful observation they make about life—all of those things make me incredibly proud to watch my two boys (who are five and seven) turn into full-fledged individuals with opinions and thoughts and concerns about the world.<\/p><p><strong>RN: Of the people in your community—your husband, friends, coworkers, parents—whose advice do you rely on most often? <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>My husband’s. He’s a great counterpoint to me. He’s the sort of person whose feathers can’t easily be ruffled. And when I’ve gotten myself worked up about a problem, or I’m really focused on something, he’s very good at giving me perspective and providing a little bit of an outsider’s viewpoint. Among my flaws, one of them is sometimes losing the forest for the trees, and he’s very good at bringing me back up to that second level and allowing me not to become so wrapped around something.<\/p><p><strong>RN: Did you have a mentor along the way? <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>Absolutely. And because I think mentors are so key, I’ve really tried to provide that same sort of mentorship to other people. But I had a couple of really wonderful mentors early on in my career. One is David Israelite, who is now the head of the National Music Publishers’&nbsp;Association. He was really crucial in the early stages of my career, helping me make the right choices and giving me opportunities that it would have been difficult for someone as young as I was to get on my own. Having a real mentor, one you’ve actually worked with, and who trusts and knows your work, is incredibly crucial. It’s harder to get that sort of mentorship from just calling someone up and saying, “Will you go to lunch and talk to me about my career?”<\/p><p><strong>RN: What’s your go-to to rejuvenate after a really stressful period at work? <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>I love to go for hikes or really long walks where I can just put in my earbuds and listen to a book or a podcast or music and then just be in the zone for a few hours. By nature, I am an introvert, so I occasionally need those times of solitude to really recharge myself. <\/p><p><strong>RN: What are some of your favorite podcasts? <\/strong><\/p><p>I listen to <em>Criminal<\/em>, which I really love. I’m obsessed with <em>This American Life<\/em>. <em>Mystery Show<\/em> I really like—the goal for each show is for her to solve a mystery without using the Internet. You should listen to it.<\/p><p><strong>RN: How do you make sure you’re the kind of person younger women in the field can look up to? <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>I think the best mentors I’ve had have been candid with me, so&nbsp;I try to be very candid when I’m providing advice to people.&nbsp;And when I see them engaging in great success, I try to make sure to congratulate them and tell them how proud I am of the things they have accomplished. I want to be there not just to help them with problems and failures, but also in times of success.<\/p><p>I also try to show through actions that women can be successful. The best compliment I ever have received in my career was from a young woman on the Romney campaign. She said to me, after the campaign was over, “You have shown me that it’s possible to have it all, and it’s possible to be respected in the workplace, and it’s possible to be a woman who can be ambitious, and who also has a family and can try to balance all those things.”&nbsp;And I laugh, because from the outside it may look like that—these things are never perfect behind the scenes. But that meant a lot to me, because I really do strive to show younger women, by my actions, how you can be successful in male-dominated worlds by just being yourself.<\/p><p><em>Illustration: <a href=\"http://www.debutart.com/artist/sam-kerr\">Sam Kerr<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202400025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202400025ce","primaryImageId":"ci01efcdd920012606","path":"/2016/06/katie-biber-empowered-women-interview-women-in-politics-silicon-valley-airbnb-having-it-all","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci020b7202400025ce"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0a9f0019512"},{"$ref":"ci01e046c950002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa10009512"},{"$ref":"ci0201534ac0002462"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0c750002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0ef0001c80a"}],"socialPopularity":988,"featuredMediaId":"ci01efcdd920012606","slug":"katie-biber-empowered-women-interview-women-in-politics-silicon-valley-airbnb-having-it-all","contentNodeId":"cn01eec71d20002560","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2016-06-27T15:49:29Z","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2016-06-27T15:49:29Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01f0402640002606","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","isNoindex":false,"title":"Rebecca Nelson","slug":"rnelson","disqusId":"aab55623-3c7b-11e6-adf8-0286c773d095","twitterUsername":"rebeccanelson","website":"http://www,rebeccarosenelson.com","bio":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Rebecca Nelson is a&nbsp;freelance&nbsp;writer based in Washington, D.C.

tml-version=\"2\" --><p>When I recently started my new job, I was paired with a mentor to show me the ropes. He taught me plenty about my new position, but he also happened to teach me something equally valuable, if a bit surprising: financial planning.<\/p><p>To 25-year-old me, financial planning was the voluntary one-hour class I took to figure out how one spends a “real person” paycheck. My high school didn’t require home economics, and my university never required any kind of financial management. The terms 401k and 403b sounded like the start of complicated passwords. Financial planning was a foreign language I had decided to put off until later—say, sometime in my thirties.<\/p><p>Then my fortysomething mentor told me how much he regretted poor financial management for two decades. At his urging, I decided to take a hard look at my finances and see a certified financial planner. Here’s why you should, too.<\/p><h2><strong>01. Money problems do not disappear.<\/strong><\/h2><p>According the <a href=\"http://www.moneyunder30.com/20-somethings-money-survey\">2015 Millennial Money Survey<\/a>, less than half of twentysomethings are saving up for retirement, and 14 percent of millennials aren't saving at all. With <a href=\"http://www.moneyunder30.com/20-somethings-money-survey\">median student loan debt at $28,000<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.moneyunder30.com/20-somethings-money-survey\">college graduate unemployment at over 7 percent<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/the-class-of-2015/\">college graduate underemployment at nearly 15 percent in 2015<\/a>, it’s understandable. We have debts to pay off, bills to cover, and basic necessities to buy. Many twenty- and thirtysomethings are living paycheck to paycheck, and planning for the future just seems too daunting. <\/p><p>Yet, as much as we millennials like to think we’re special, we’re not. Most of America is struggling too. <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/03/30/almost-half-of-americans-arent-saving-nearly-enough\">U.S. News<\/a> reports that&nbsp;18 percent of Americans aren't saving money at all. <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/24/pf/emergency-savings/\">CNN Money<\/a> reports that&nbsp;76 percent are living paycheck to paycheck, and 20 percent don't have enough of a financial cushion to last more than two weeks without a paycheck <em>across all income levels.<\/em><\/p><p>The reason is that bills don't go away with time; they <em>increase <\/em>even as our paychecks increase. As we age, we may need to make room for children, a bigger place to live, emergencies, more doctor's appointments and ER visits, and various other living costs.<\/p><p>The good news is, our ability to save isn't dependent on our income level.&nbsp;Finding a way to save $10, $20, or $100 a paycheck now sets you up for a habit to save 5, 10, or 20 percent a paycheck in the future when things (hopefully) aren’t as tight.<\/p><h2>02. It’ll help your current or future marriage.<\/h2><p><a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/01/talking-about-money-with-your-partner-relationships\">Money is often cited as a common marriage conflict<\/a>. <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1069&amp;context=fchd_facpub\">Jeffery Dew of Utah State University<\/a> discovered that married couples who argue about finances once a week are twice as likely to divorce than couples who disagreed once a month. What’s with all the fuss about money?<\/p><p>Researchers led by <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230928/\">Lauren Papp at the Couples Lab<\/a> at the University of Wisconsin study intimate relationships extensively. Unlike other conflicts between spouses, money conflicts are pervasive, more troublesome, and can remain unresolved despite repeated attempts at problem solving. In essence, money is an ever-changing problem that requires new solutions. Though financial planning involves looking at objective numbers and figures, according to Papp and colleagues, couples tend to use more negative emotional behaviors when discussing money.<\/p><p>Relationships expert&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gottman.com/research/research-faqs/\">Dr. John Gottman<\/a>&nbsp;discovered destructive behavior patterns from watching videotaped arguments between couples.&nbsp;How a couple handles conflict, whether financial or otherwise, is a large predictor of divorce. Gottman, with his researching partner and wife Julie, has found that the couples who remained happily married could identify common negative behaviors in their interactions and opt to react in a gentle, constructive manner.<\/p><p>But it's difficult to discuss money this way without proper tools and a framework. In my first sessions with my financial planner, I would get defensive almost to the verge of tears. With practice, I’ve learned to be honest with myself and my spending, and now I’m much less defensive with my financial planner. Becoming intentional about how you discuss money now can lead to more openness and constructive financial conversations with your spouse down the road. <\/p><h2><strong>03. It prepares you for the unexpected. <\/strong><\/h2><p>Working in the emergency department of a hospital, every day I see people experience the unexpected: heart attacks, stroke, accidents, life-changing&nbsp;cancer&nbsp;diagnoses. If nursing has taught me one thing, it’s to expect the unexpected.<\/p><p>As a single 25-year-old, if I die tomorrow, I don't have much financial obligation left in the world. But what about that hopeful someday when I have a husband? A mortgage? Kids? I’d feel much more insecure about their financial future without me. <\/p><p>According to my financial planner, the best time to prepare for a house and kids is <em>before <\/em>you have a house and kids. That’s why this very single 25-year-old has life insurance.&nbsp;With a great health history, it’s unlikely I’ll die in the next ten years. But if tomorrow I’m diagnosed with cancer, injured, disabled, or would otherwise be disqualified for my life insurance plan, it's not a problem. Why? Because I set it up <em>before<\/em> any of that happened. <\/p><p>It makes sense to start life insurance&nbsp;before your natural health begins to decline, because the rate can't be changed so long as you make payments. Mine will remain the inexpensive, very healthy, 25-year-old me rate for the term of my life insurance. But what if I waited until 35 and  my cholesterol levels have increased? My monthly rate would be much higher because my likelihood of death has increased with both age and poor health indicators. <\/p><p>As for making other plans to prepare you for the unexpected, an experienced financial planner can help figure out what’s best for you and your situation.<\/p><h2>04. <strong>It can improve your health.<\/strong><\/h2><p>Reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X\"><em>The Power of Habit<\/em><\/a> by Charles Duhigg, I learned the concept of keystone habits. It is a single habit that creates a domino effect of other habits. It’s the cornerstone, the base, the soil for other habits to grow. <\/p><p>Duhigg cites the research of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17032494\">Megan Oaten and Ken Cheng<\/a> of Macquarie University in Sydney. Oaten and Cheng tested gains in self-regulation by assigning volunteers to a two-month physical exercise program. Subjects who successfully completed the program also performed better on self-regulatory&nbsp;exercises. Unexpectedly, the subjects also reported a significant decrease in smoking, drinking alcohol and caffeine, and a significant increase in good habits like healthier eating, better emotional control, maintaining household chores, attending commitments, improved study habits, and monitoring spending.<\/p><p>After results from their initial study, <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487006001012\">Oaten and Cheng decided to test gains in self-regulation again<\/a>. This time, volunteers entered a four-month financial monitoring program. Those in the test group who completed the program showed similar results to the two-month exercise group: a decrease in stress and increase in good habits.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Financial planning is a keystone habit. Knowing that I spend $40 a month on the gym when I could be saving it for graduate school, for instance, motivates me to utilize my membership. Looking at my monthly cost of groceries and dining out, I’ve started buying produce that is in season and cooking more at home. I may not have Oaten and Cheng studying me, but I know financial planning has generated many other good habits in my life. It will do the same for yours.<\/p><h2><strong>05. A penny saved can become way more than a penny earned, but you have to start now. <\/strong><\/h2><p>Before I started working with a financial planner, I’d hear over and over again why it’s important to save for retirement while young.<em> \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\"<\/em> I thought, brushing it off. Then I did the math myself with a <a href=\"https://www.investor.gov/tools/calculators/compound-interest-calculator\">compound interest calculator<\/a>.<\/p><p>Let’s say at 25, you invest $100 in a retirement fund at an interest rate of 5 percent. You plan on retiring at age 65. So that $100 has forty years to collect compounded interest each year. At age 65, that $100 will have become $729.80. <\/p><p>Now let’s say at 35, you invest that same $100 in a retirement fund with the same interest rate of 5 percent. You still plan on retiring at age 65, so that $100 has thirty years to collect compounded interest each year. At age 65, you’ll have $444.02.<\/p><p>Just by putting $100 away ten years earlier, I'd gain an additional $285.78. That number got my attention. What would happen if I added just $100 more each year?<\/p><p>Not saving anything for retirement now is essentially wasting free money. Saved money accrues interest. The earlier it’s saved, the more time your earned interest starts earning interest. Even if it’s $10, $15, $20 a month, that money grows exponentially higher now than it does years down the road. <\/p><p>If your workplace matches retirement benefits, not putting in the minimum match each paycheck is also like saying no to free money. Yes, you’re $40-ish dollars out each paycheck, but your company is also&nbsp;<em>giving<\/em> you $40 each paycheck for your retirement.<\/p><p>Regardless of how tight money is today, saving even a little in a 401k or 403b now will help you out exponentially in the long haul. When you change jobs, just&nbsp;<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2014/03/finance-how-to-roll-over-your-401k\">make sure to roll it over<\/a>.<\/p><p>Taking a cold, hard look at how you save and spend your cold, hard cash is eye-opening. But financial planning is one of the best decisions I’ve made in my twenties.

Stressed. Overwhelmed. It seemed like I was working all the time, and there wasn’t time for anything else. I was going crazy. Something had to change.<\/p><p>When I read Laura Vanderkam’s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/09/working-mothers-i-know-how-she-does-it-laura-vanderkam\">first article<\/a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>Verily<\/em>, I realized what that “something” was: a change of perspective.<\/p><p>The article was an excerpt of Vanderkam’s latest book, <em>I Know How She Does It<\/em>—a book about high-earning mothers managing to have full, balanced lives. I’m not in the high-earning category (I’m a high school teacher), and I’m not a mother yet. But the article spoke to me. Regardless of salary or family size, we could all use more balance.  One part in particular stood out: “There are 168 hours in a week. If you work fifty and sleep eight per night (fifty-six hours per week in total), that leaves sixty-two hours for other things.” <\/p><p>I had never thought of it that way. It was so simple, yet—wow. I had to learn more, so I picked up the book.&nbsp;In&nbsp;<em>I Know How She Does It<\/em>, Vanderkam shares her findings from charts that women kept to document how they spent their time. Each chart is divided into thirty-minute blocks, and each block is a “tile” on what she calls a “mosaic” of time. The mosaic gives a picture of how we spend our time and what matters. <\/p><p>The charts tell a different story than the one we typically hear. Despite all the press to suggest otherwise, having a balanced life is not impossible.  There is chaos. But there is also beauty. <\/p><p>Inspired by the book, I decided to chart my time. Through crafting my mosaic for two weeks, I learned some valuable lessons, and I gained a fresh perspective.<\/p><h2>I Learned to Think About Value<\/h2><p>Vanderkam shares a profound phrase she found at a berry farm: “Remember, the berry season is short.” It stuck with me. Life is short. It’s up to me how I fill it. <\/p><p>One evening, I was sitting on the couch with my husband. We weren’t watching anything, reading anything, or talking about anything. We were just being together. My mind drifted, and I wondered, “How will things like this look on my chart? Is this a good use of time?” <\/p><p>I could have been working, cleaning, or accomplishing something. But I came to an important conclusion: Time spent sitting with my husband, doing nothing in particular, is not time wasted. It is valuable—especially because his top <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2013/04/dr-gary-chapman-explains-the-5-love-languages\">love languages<\/a> are quality time and physical touch.<\/p><p>Later, we both got out our phones. I scrolled through social media, not even paying attention to what I was looking at. We were in the same room, but there was zero bonding.  This was not a valuable use of time. <\/p><p>As I sat down to fill out my chart each day, I started thinking of my actions in terms of value. “Putzed around on the Internet” didn’t add anything to my day. But “read good articles” did. “Cleaned out my inbox” didn’t really do much, whereas cleaning up my desk area helped me be more productive later. <\/p><h2>I Changed My Habits<\/h2><p>It’s no surprise that charting my time helped me break some bad habits—and develop some good ones. It kept me accountable. This is in part because when I started charting my time, it became easier to stick to my goal of writing every day. The act of putting “writing” on the chart felt like a victory. I had done something good for myself. <\/p><p>My morning and evening routines also improved. After a few days, I realized how often I hit the snooze button. Instead of trying to force an earlier wake-up call, I started setting my alarm for a little later. At night, putting “reading” on the chart before bedtime felt a lot better than “looked at Twitter.” <\/p><p>I also found ways to use extra time—those few free minutes before I head out the door, for example. If I’m at home, I can squeeze the tidying up into ten minutes rather than letting it stretch into twenty minutes later. And when I went out, I bought a bigger purse—one that I could fit a book or journal<strong> <\/strong>in so that I could do those things in my downtime throughout the day.<\/p><p>I still have habits that need changing. For instance, I spend way too much time looking at my phone, especially when I’m tired or stressed. But I’m more aware of it now, and I’m making improvements. Changing my time habits, little by little, has made a big difference in my motivation and mood.<\/p><h2>I Started Focusing More<\/h2><p>At first, I worried that I would feel constrained by looking at my life in thirty-minute blocks. But I’ve found it to be liberating. There is freedom in knowing that if there’s a task I don’t enjoy, I only have to endure it for ten more minutes.<\/p><p>When grading homework on weekends, I used to get distracted really easily. I changed my Pandora station, read emails, and played Words with Friends. The grading took twice as long as it should have.<\/p><p>Having a thirty-minute time slot helped me stick to the task at hand. I challenged myself to see how much I could get done in thirty minutes. If I reached a goal, I could move ahead or reward myself with a break until the next thirty-minute block started.  <\/p><p>I’ve not only started focusing more on individual tasks but on categories as well. Work is work, and leisure is leisure. In order to have a complete mosaic, I need both of those, along with self-care. Seeing my time as tiles has helped me get out of the constant work mindset and enjoy my personal time.<\/p><h2>I Narrowed My Hobbies<\/h2><p>There are <em>a lot<\/em> of hobbies I’d like to pursue: writing, reading, scrapbooking, baking, embroidery, knitting, learning to crochet, doing puzzles, playing the guitar and ukulele . . . the list goes on. There’s so much that it feels overwhelming. And instead of enjoying the ones I am doing, I feel guilty about the ones I’m neglecting. <\/p><p>Even though I’ve made leisure time more of a priority, there are still only so many leisure tiles in a week. When it’s time for that beautiful space, I’ve started playing a game of “Would you rather?” with myself. Would I rather write or attempt to teach myself to crochet? Would I rather read or knit? <\/p><p>Within a few days of time charting, it became clear what the winning hobbies were. And I realized that I’d rather spend a lot of time on a few things than a little time on all of them.<\/p><p>The narrowing of hobbies also has a side benefit. I’m reading <em>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up <\/em>and getting ready to start the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/08/kondo-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-the-three-principles-that-helped-me-declutter-my-life\">KonMari method<\/a> of tidying my home. The act of charting has helped me see more clearly which activities give me the “thrill of joy.” Sorry, crochet hooks—it’s time for you to go. <\/p><h2>I Loosened My Expectations<\/h2><p>One of my favorite quotes from Vanderkam’s book is, “There are no typical weeks.” There’s a great sense of freedom and peace that comes with this fact. <\/p><p>Before I started charting, I caught myself falling into the trap of seeking normalcy. My internal dialogue went something like this:&nbsp;“<em>Maybe this won’t be a good week to start. Work is going to be CRAZY. Maybe next week—but that’s the week I’m chaperoning a weekend trip.  The week after—no, that’s a strange week, too.<\/em>”<\/p><p>I soon realized that every week had a quirk. I was longing for something that didn’t exist. <\/p><p>I shared this with a friend, and she said maybe one of the reasons we get so frustrated is that we have false expectations of how our weeks will go. We set ourselves up for disappointment, thinking, “After this, things will be normal.” While it’s true that some seasons are busier than others, there is always going to be <em>something <\/em>a little out of the ordinary. <\/p><p>Instead of waiting for the “crazy” weeks to be over, I’ve learned to accept them. I’ve also tried to make the most of them. Looking back over the past few weeks, there have been some long work days. But there have also been great nights of sleep, dates with my husband, and much-enjoyed episodes of <em>Downton Abbey<\/em>. <\/p><p>Looking at the big picture, I can see how all those little time tiles fit together. The mosaic isn’t perfect, but it’s mine. And it reminds me that life is beautiful.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"http://olivialeighphotoart.com/\">Olivia Leigh Photography<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202400025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202400025ce","primaryImageId":"ci01e4683e30012673","path":"/2016/02/laura-vanderkam-i-know-how-she-does-it-chart-your-time-leisure-overwhelm","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci020b7202400025ce"},{"$ref":"ci01dfb36c0000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01e45112e0002673"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0a9f0019512"}],"socialPopularity":357,"featuredMediaId":"ci01e4683e70012672","slug":"laura-vanderkam-i-know-how-she-does-it-chart-your-time-leisure-overwhelm","contentNodeId":"cn01e4511000002673","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2015-09-29T13:48:48Z","publicationTimestamp":"2015-09-29T13:48:48Z","id":"ci01cec0df6000efe2","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","title":"Kellie B.

It usually refers only to women. Obviously, there’s reason for this—motherhood and career navigation, and especially the combination thereof, bring especially acute challenges for women. But after stumbling across approximately 10,000 articles about Facebook’s&nbsp;Chief Operating Officer <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=work+life+balance&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8#q=Sheryl+Sandberg\">Sheryl Sandberg talking about work-life balance<\/a>, I’ve started to wonder: Does anyone realize that men deal with this, too?<\/p><p>A recent <a href=\"http://www2.cipd.co.uk/pm/peoplemanagement/b/weblog/archive/2017/07/28/dads-silently-struggling-with-work-life-balance.aspx​\">study<\/a> by the University of Georgia with a global sample of 250,000 men found that men are struggling to balance work and family obligations as much as women, but they feel less able to talk about the issue.<\/p><p>“It’s just a huge disconnect because the media almost always frames [work-life balance] as a women’s issue,”&nbsp;study leader Kristen Shockley, a psychologist at the University of Georgia, <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/59960-work-life-balance-not-just-female-struggle.html\">told<\/a> <em>Live Science.<\/em><\/p><p>There are very good reasons why the challenges men face aren’t equivalent to the ones women face when rearing children and furthering their careers, such as the minimum of six weeks the body needs to recover from giving birth, the breast-feeding for a year many women try for,&nbsp;or the many other maternal gifts nature has granted women but not men. But perhaps part of the problem with our dialog about balancing children and career is that men are being left out of the conversation.&nbsp;When <em>The<\/em> <em>Atlantic<\/em> published Anne-Marie Slaughter’s<em> <\/em>lightning rod of a cover story in 2012,&nbsp;“<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/\">Why Women Still Can’t Have It All<\/a>,”&nbsp;there were only murmurs of men’s voices in response.&nbsp;“<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/06/men-cant-have-it-all-either/258890/\">Men Can’t Have It All, Either<\/a>,”&nbsp;James Joyner piped in with a response piece.&nbsp;However, with dual-income households becoming the norm, men are increasingly required to make sacrifices to accommodate their wives’&nbsp;careers and help with child-rearing in ways like never before. And as Joyner’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/06/men-cant-have-it-all-either/258890/\">article<\/a> on the matter astutely notes, with women ascendant in the career world,&nbsp;“an increasing number of men are less successful than their wives, in terms of income or job title.”<\/p><p>Whether or not this makes men shy, I think we should start more conversations about this. First of all,<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>I think it’s helpful for men and women alike to have an open dialogue about the unique challenges we face, regardless of whether most men would like to remain the strong, silent type. And, to be honest, I think a lot of people would be surprised to hear that the juggling act, while certainly stressful, has benefits unforeseen to many, including to the younger&nbsp;“bachelor”&nbsp;version of myself.<\/p><p>At this point in my life, I’m a full-time employee, husband, and father to two girls. I feel like I’m drowning in obligations half the time, and when I’m not drowning, I’m dancing between raindrops. You could say it’s my fault because I married a beautiful and enormously intelligent woman, and&nbsp;I can’t deny the world her gifts. Sure, she’s an excellent mother. But she’s also a journalist who got a job with a cable news station earlier this year. Did I mention that the TV gig is in addition to her role as a senior editor at a very successful online publication?<\/p><p>This is all to say, I understand intimately the challenges of work-life balance that my wife bears. Because we bear it together.&nbsp;Every time my wife has to appear on television—which can happen with as little notice as an hour or two—I leave my job in the city to rush home to the suburbs and take care of the kids. I then have to finish my work in the den with two elementary-school daughters in the background. Both my wife and I frequently travel for work. I’m on the school board of my daughters’&nbsp;school, my wife and I are active in our church, and our calendar is full of fundraisers and social events. And our nearest close relatives are more than two thousand miles away, so aside from some wonderful friends, no one is around to help out with the kids.<\/p><p>You could say I fit snugly into the men-with-work-life-balance-problems category that Joyner foreshadowed and the Georgia study confirmed. Others may think that to admit to it is to somehow complain about women’s success in the professional world—and by extension, to complain about men’s increased&nbsp;home-life obligations that women used to predominantly carry.&nbsp;So men don’t speak up—but maybe we should. Because this couldn’t be further from the truth for me.<\/p><p>What I think young men (and women) need to hear more is that adding marriage and kids has <em>helped<\/em> my work-life balance. In many respects, I believe the benefits of being a family man are undersold. I didn’t get married until I was 30, and then we had our first child within a year. I really didn’t know what to expect from marriage. In terms of relationship experience, it felt like not knowing how to ride a bike and suddenly being strapped to a throttled Harley. While still making the adjustment to marriage, I had a child, which meant that not only did I have a lot more to help out with at home, but I wasn’t sleeping either.<\/p><p>And yet, it was in this period that my career took off. Why? My priorities had changed. I had less time at work, so when I did, I worked harder and was more focused. And I realized that prior to being a married dad, a lot my energy had dissipated into selfish pursuits. Frivolous socializing and ill-defined attempts at dating wasted a lot of valuable time that could have been spent doing meaningful things.<\/p><p>I now realize the time in my life when my work-life balance was most out of whack was my single post-college years. This is especially important for young men to understand because they often don’t have domestic aspirations the way women do—and we’re currently experiencing something of a cultural crisis as men are putting off marriage. So now I tell single guys: Be deliberate about dating. If you’re having fun seeing someone but they don’t share your values and marriage is unlikely, move on. And if you’re in a good relationship, don’t put off marriage because you’re worried about superficial concerns like money.<\/p><p>I also have juggling work and kids to thank for helping me pay more deliberate attention to my wife. Most adult men have several different roles and responsibilities—husband, father, employee, church elder, citizen, charity volunteer, and so forth. Being clear on priorities is immensely helpful. It’s important for me as a man to realize that the most important responsibility I have, above other obligations to work or even children, is my wife. This seems obvious, but especially after children are born and responsibilities start to pile up, couples have a tendency to forget to take care of each other. This is a HUGE mistake. One of the grand benefits of marriage is realizing that challenges are best resolved by putting together the experience and expertise of two different people, hammering out a solution, and confronting the problem as a unified whole.<\/p><p>The common denominator for happiness is still always working toward something with a clear purpose and a goal. When it comes to anything in life, be it your marriage, children, friendships, or career, the work you put in is commensurate to the reward. Which brings me to&nbsp;perhaps the greatest lesson I’ve learned as a working dad—to be grateful. The less time I spend complaining about juggling things, the more time I spend accomplishing things and merely being happy.<\/p><p>So while it’s helpful to acknowledge that men are dealing with work-life balance issues too, maybe what both sexes need is a greater focus on being in this together.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>I can’t be upset that I have to make sacrifices because I love my amazing kids and am enormously proud of my wife. I didn’t set out to marry what some might call a&nbsp;“career woman”—but I did set out to marry a compelling woman. The fact that lots of other people in the larger world value her contributions only reflects that to be true. And if that means I have to figure out how to carry the load at home more? All the better.<\/p><p>I think for both men and women juggling families and work, the key is ultimately&nbsp;to keep focused on long-term goals, and those goals should not be derailed by the frustration created by the inevitable moments of short-term chaos. As a husband who loves his wife, I know we’ll always find a way to make it work, even when there are setbacks and daunting challenges. There will also be moments when our responsibilities and family seem in harmony, and those meaningful moments, however fleeting, make it all worthwhile.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"http://www.horaceandmae.com/\">Horace &amp; Mae<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202400025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202400025ce","primaryImageId":"ci020b5e30b000272f","path":"/2017/08/work-life-balance-is-real-for-men-too-georgia-study-082017","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci020b7202400025ce"},{"$ref":"ci01e0a25400009512"},{"$ref":"ci01cde76c7000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0a9f0019512"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcd002efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01cfa20eb0002a83"}],"socialPopularity":90,"featuredMediaId":"ci020b5e30b000272f","slug":"work-life-balance-is-real-for-men-too-georgia-study-082017","contentNodeId":"cn020b1e3b900025ce","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2015-09-29T13:48:48Z","publicationTimestamp":"2015-09-29T13:48:48Z","id":"ci01cec0c7100099de","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","title":"Mark Hemingway","slug":"mhemingway","disqusId":"861a7c18-66eb-11e5-be2e-0022195fd05d","email":"mhemingway@verilymag.com","path":"/author/mhemingway","migrationId":"165"},"teaser":"Why we don’t like to speak about them","promoTitle":"Work-Life Balance Challenges Are Real for Men, Too","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":1.46795,"lastCount":1},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":1.4674,"lastCount":1},"linkedin":{"acceleration":-8.84407e-28,"velocity":0,"estimate":13.2081,"lastCount":11},"facebook":{"acceleration":1.04662e-11,"velocity":0.00000845423,"estimate":80.2467,"lastCount":77},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0}},"dek":"A recent study reveals I’m not alone.","featuredMedia":{"$ref":"ci020b5e30b000272f"},"ownerId":null},{"authorProfileId":"ci01cec0ac3000efe2","isInstantArticle":true,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-05-16T10:30:00Z","sectionIds":[["ci020b7202400025ce"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci020a34c1f00027b4","objectType":"ContentArticle","terms":[{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:27:50Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0aa60009512","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"books","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:27:50Z","disqusId":"7ad96c92-fd05-11e4-afb7-002219604568","path":"/tag/books/","slug":"books","displayName":"books"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:41:19Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0dcf0002a83","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"mental health","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:41:19Z","disqusId":"5ccacb18-fd07-11e4-aeb1-001ec9b1277e","path":"/tag/mental-health/","slug":"mental-health","displayName":"mental health"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-12-21T18:46:43Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01e0b05920009512","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Grief","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-12-21T18:46:42Z","disqusId":"2daced7c-a813-11e5-b716-002219604568","path":"/tag/grief/","slug":"grief","displayName":"Grief","promoTitle":"Grief"},{"$ref":"ci01cfa20eb0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01dfb36c0000efe2"}],"isNoindex":false,"title":"What to Do When Life Breaks Your Heart, According to Sheryl Sandberg and Prince Harry","primaryImage":{"height":620,"cloudinaryVersionId":1494511698,"id":"ci020a72cd300026ef","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Grief","primaryPhotoId":"ci020a72cd300026ef","hasFaces":false,"width":1200,"publicId":"MTQ3MDU2MTYyOTA1MjY5OTk5","format":"jpg","bytes":998766},"editedTimestamp":"2017-05-17T14:05:47Z","disqusId":"96647e2a-3403-11e7-b86e-02e2c72ed8f6","autoSaved":false,"tmlEmbeds":[],"sectionsLeafNode":["ci020b7202400025ce"],"bodyTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>“I can’t imagine.”&nbsp;<\/p><p>It’s a phrase Sheryl Sandberg heard often after her husband, Dave Goldberg, unexpectedly died at age 48 in 2015. In her recent book,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Option-Adversity-Building-Resilience-Finding/dp/1524732680\">Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy<\/a><\/em>,&nbsp;cowritten with psychology professor Adam Grant, Sandberg paints a brutally honest picture of what grief looks like. “I can’t imagine, either,” she’d often reply. “But I have no choice.”<\/p><p>Sandberg’s words&nbsp;reminded me of one of my own brushes with grief. “I Can Only Imagine” by MercyMe<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>was one of the songs performed at the funeral of a friend, Gabe, who died the day before my twentieth birthday. When “I Can Only Imagine” started to play in the church on the day of his funeral, I watched as some of his close friends walked out. “Gabe would have hated this song,” some scoffed under their breath. Somehow suggesting in soft-rock hues that our friend was in a better place failed to soothe. Some of us were still stuck in the gorge.<\/p><p>I may not have experienced something as earth-shattering as losing an immediate family member, but my experience losing a dear friend made me relate to how Sandberg described receiving platitudes in the face of grief. In <em>Option B<\/em>, Sandberg explains how phrases such as “You’ll get through this” and “It will get better” were meaningless to her during the period of acute grief. Similarly, it’s common for religious people to admit that phrases such as “He or she is in a better place” bring little comfort in the depths of loss.<\/p><p>Rather than paint over these darker feelings of grief, Sandberg and Grant say the healthiest way to process grief is by “leaning into the suck,” as Sandberg’s rabbi put it. “Expect it to be awful,” and honor your feelings as they come. Being patient with themselves and exercising self-compassion, Grant instructed Sandberg, is how some people not only endure hard experiences but grow stronger in spite of them. It’s this outlook that paves the way for something called <em>post-traumatic growth<\/em>.<\/p><p>When we don’t honor our feelings—by shutting them off or trying to rush them along—we can create bigger problems for ourselves. As Prince Harry <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/16/prince-harry-sought-counselling-death-mother-led-two-years-total/?WT.mc_id=tmg_share_tw\">shared<\/a> last month in an interview with the <em>Telegraph<\/em>’s&nbsp;Bryony Gordon for her podcast,&nbsp;“I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12 and, therefore, shutting down all of my emotions for the last twenty years has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well. . . . My way of dealing with it was sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mum because why would that help? [I thought] it’s only going to make you sad; it’s not going to bring her back.”<\/p><p>But after what Harry described as two years of total chaos, he started to talk to a therapist. “All of a sudden, all of this grief that I have never processed started to come to the forefront, and I was like, there is actually a lot of stuff here that I need to deal with,” he said.<\/p><p>“Like others who experience crucibles, Prince Harry tried to avoid thinking about his loss, but his active mind kept bringing it back all the time,” Bill George, senior fellow at Harvard Business School and author of <em>Discover Your True North<\/em> <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/05/09/advice-on-grief-prince-harry/\">wrote<\/a> for <em>Fortune<\/em> this month. “His story reminds us all to cope with our crucibles, fully process grief to make sense of it before turning it into personal growth and flourishing.”<\/p><p>With people as noteworthy as Sheryl Sandberg and Prince Harry speaking out about grief, it would seem that, much like burnout has been getting worldwide attention the past couple years, grief is having a moment. And we’re all going to be better for it.<\/p><p>\"Leaning into the suck\" doesn’t mean shutting out all the good. In fact, Sandberg and Grant wrote, the darkness will pass, but we have to “help it along.” For the grieving person, that involves acknowledging the positive things in their lives.<\/p><p>Sandberg kept a journal and began jotting down things she was grateful for that day, or accomplishments she’d made that day (such as paying attention through most of a meeting—yes, an accomplishment for a person in the midst of acute grief). Sophie Caldecott, a&nbsp;friend and colleague at <em>Verily,&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BTkmD-cj1NN/?taken-by=_by_sophie_&amp;hl=en\">mentioned<\/a> a similar thing in an Instagram post recently. After losing her father three years ago, she wrote, “I was out of my mind with grief” to the point where she couldn’t handle a gratitude journal. “I couldn’t tell myself to feel anything at that time, let alone gratitude,” she wrote. But she started keeping a \"beauty journal, which was just a notebook where I wrote down at least one thing a day that struck me. A flock of seagulls flying overhead in the morning light, mist on the river as I walked home in the evening, the refreshing crisp taste of olives and a glass of cold white wine, a freckle on my daughter’s knee.” Ultimately, Sophie found that “beauty takes you out of yourself, and then before you realize what has happened, you are feeling all sorts of emotions again; you’re looking outward and connecting with the world; you’re starting to heal.”<\/p><p>Sandberg and Grant distilled these components of healing into digestible chapters of the book. People who avoid the three dangerous <em>P<\/em>s are on the surest road of recovery. These people work hard not to <em>personalize<\/em> the tragedy (i.e., blame themselves or think it’s all about them); they curb temptations to view the tragedy as <em>pervasive <\/em>(that it will affect every part of their lives); and they strive to remind themselves that the pain is not&nbsp;<em>permanent<\/em>. These things don’t come naturally for many people. But they make all the difference.<\/p><p>Similarly, those recovering from the loss of a loved one need to talk about their grief—Sandberg’s constant \"elephant in the room.\" I, too, remember that when my friend died, my biggest fear, aside from him being completely gone, was that I’d forget him. I sought out mutual friends to reminisce with and met his mom out for lunch. It made all the difference.<\/p><p>As someone once told me, “Life is fair. Sooner or later, it breaks everyone’s heart.\" <em>Option B<\/em> was written on this premise. Everyone is living some kind of option B at some point, after option A spectacularly falls apart. It’s up to us to prepare for it—there is, in fact, such a thing as “pre-traumatic growth,” the book informs—or to step up to the challenge when it rears its ugly face. For those who seek post-traumatic growth, Sandberg and Grant write, “In the wake of the most crushing blows, people can find greater strength and deeper meaning.”<\/p><p>Famed Danish existentialist Søren Kierkegaard once wrote, “Life can only be understood backward, but it must be lived forward.” I can look back and undoubtedly see how my friend Gabe’s life affected mine for the better. I am thankful for having shared time with him while he was here. Just thinking of the road trip he and a friend of mine took together days before his death gives me peace. I have not forgotten. And I take these memories, gratitude, and appreciation for the fragility of life as I live forward.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"http://thekitcheners.co.uk/\">The Kitcheners<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202400025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202400025ce","primaryImageId":"ci020a72cd300026ef","path":"/2017/05/grief-sheryl-sandberg-adam-grant-option-b-prince-harry-051617","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa60009512"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202400025ce"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01e0b05920009512"},{"$ref":"ci01cfa20eb0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01dfb36c0000efe2"}],"socialPopularity":113,"featuredMediaId":"ci020a72cd300026ef","slug":"grief-sheryl-sandberg-adam-grant-option-b-prince-harry-051617","contentNodeId":"cn020a34c1f00027b4","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2017-09-01T16:36:17Z","photo":{"height":3677,"cloudinaryVersionId":1455751591,"defaultCaption":"","id":"ci01e57be29001265f","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"MaryRoseHeadshot-1-square.jpg","primaryPhotoId":"ci01e57be29001265f","width":3677,"publicId":"MTM2NjUxNTc1MzcxMjQ1MTUz","format":"jpg","bytes":6975415},"linkedinProfileUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maryroserybak/","publicationTimestamp":"2016-02-25T00:21:31Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"id":"ci01cec0ac3000efe2","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","title":"Mary Rose Somarriba","primaryImage":{"$ref":"ci01e57be29001265f"},"slug":"maryrose","instagramProfileUrl":"https://instagram.com/maryrosesoma","disqusId":"85fac206-66eb-11e5-be2e-0022195fd05d","twitterUsername":"maryrosesoma","email":"maryrose@verilymag.com","bio":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Mary Rose is a contributing editor for Verily Magazine with over a decade of experience in magazine publishing.

Surveys show women reporting happiness levels at an all-time low, and advertisements continue to vie for filling the happy gap if we just buy this product, try this lifestyle, make this change.<\/p><p>It also shows in the books we’re buying. Comfortably sitting on the bestseller list right now is a book by Meik Wiking, CEO of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen. <em>The Little Book of Hygge<\/em> offers insights into the “Danish secrets to happy living,” and we Americans are eating it up. Another recent book titled&nbsp;<em>The Power of Meaning: Crafting a Life That Matters&nbsp;<\/em>may explain why.&nbsp;“Research shows that being fixated on happiness can actually make people feel lonely and unhappy,”&nbsp;author Emily Esfahani Smith <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/power-of-a-meaningful-life/\">said in a recent interview<\/a> for <em>Scientific American<\/em>.<\/p><p>She continues: “The happiness frenzy distracts people from what really matters, which is leading a meaningful life. Human beings have a need for meaning. We’re creatures that seek meaning, make meaning, and yearn for meaning. The question is—how can we lead a meaningful life? The route to meaning lies in connecting and contributing to something bigger than yourself—and not in gratifying yourself and focusing on what you, yourself, need and want, as the happiness industry encourages us to do.”<\/p><p>If the Danish have figured out the better approach to happy living, it would seem that Americans need to come up with our own form of hygge.&nbsp;Fourteen years ago, I experienced a moment where the two concepts collided—hygge and the fruitless American search for happiness—and I haven’t forgotten it.&nbsp;On a transatlantic choir trip with a roommate in college, we made a stop in the Netherlands. We found ourselves in such a small town that we saw quaint farms and spacious fields with chickens from the bus window.<\/p><p>There were no hotels large enough to hold all of us on the trip, so we were divided up into villagers’ houses. As our hostess showed my roommate and me our rooms, a surreal sense of peace overtook me. Candlelight and simply designed rooms with twin-size beds provided a space to think.&nbsp;In the morning, we came down to a breakfast table I’ll never forget. Hard-boiled eggs were sitting in egg holders with little egg-size sweaters keeping them warm; a teapot was sitting on the table on a stand that had a tea light candle underneath (so <em>that’<\/em><em>s<\/em> why they call them tea lights!), and the bread was freshly baked. I took a picture of the table and still have it. I wanted to hold on to the moment, and never before or since then have I experienced anything like it.<\/p><p>After reading <em>The Little Book of Hygge<\/em>, I realize what I experienced in that overnight stay was <em>gezelligheid<\/em>, the Netherlands’ variant on the Danish hygge. As Meik puts it, “The concept is important in both cultures, and candles, fireplaces, and Christmas are core elements in hygge and gezelligheid.” I learned that a circular lamp in my bedroom on that stay was a Klint lampshade, one of the iconic Danish lamps. I learned that the hot tea on our breakfast table combined two top elements of hygge—candles and hot drinks. Coziness abounded, and with it, warmth of the soul.<\/p><p>Contrary to being products to fill a happiness gap, these items were only instruments. They were not consumed as an end in themselves; they were setting the stage for quiet and calm and reflection that Esfahani Smith would say is the real producer of happiness.<\/p><p>Capturing this,&nbsp;Esfahani Smith&nbsp;starts her book with one of her favorite quotes by Virginia Woolf: “What is the meaning of life? That was all—a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years. The great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were daily little miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one.”<\/p><p>If there’s one caption I could put on my photo from the Netherlands that morning, it’s “Here is one.”<\/p><p>Call it hygge or gezelligheid—what I experienced in the Netherlands was a respite from the busyness and overload that is life as an American in your twenties . . .&nbsp;and we didn’t even have smartphones back then. What’s the next best thing, what’s everyone doing tonight, what’s another social escape I can partake in to seek, if not happiness, a good time? Rather than providing answers to meaning, everything was (perhaps unintentionally) covering up the questions; everything was a distraction from true reflection.<\/p><p>As it turns out, I was not alone.&nbsp;Esfahani Smith says,&nbsp;“Research shows that there are millions of people who are unsure of what makes their lives meaningful—and that rates of suicide, depression, anxiety, loneliness, and drug addiction have been rising for decades. Because so many of us are struggling to understand our&nbsp;‘why,’&nbsp;I think we’re turning to false substitutes for meaning—like technology and the pursuit of happiness—to fill our existential vacuum, or what Louis C. K. once called&nbsp;‘the forever empty’&nbsp;feeling that lurks inside us and rears its head from time to time.”<\/p><p>That Louis C. K. skit&nbsp;Esfahani&nbsp;Smith mentions <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2013/12/turn-off-and-tune-in-how-to-curb-cell-phone-addiction\">speaks to<\/a> American culture’s current rush to our smartphones to fill our empty moments. In so doing, the comedian once told Conan O’Brien, we lose the&nbsp;“ability to just be yourself . . . to just sit there. Pretty much 100 percent of people driving are texting . . . people are willing to risk taking a life—and ruining their own—because they don’t want to feel alone for a second.”&nbsp;Yet at the end of the day, we still feel overwhelmingly alone.<\/p><p>What we’re denying ourselves in these filled moments is reflection. “Leading a meaningful life requires being reflective, being present and aware of others, and being of service to others,” Esfahani Smith says. “And I don’t see how we can do those things when we’re walking around with headphones on, lost in our own little worlds, and constantly checking our phones for updates or filling our minds with dribs and drabs of meaningless stimuli.”<\/p><p>According to recent data compiled by MediaKix, we will spend more hours and years of our lives watching screens than in actual human interaction. If we <a href=\"http://www.socialmediatoday.com/marketing/how-much-time-do-people-spend-social-media-infographic\">look at the numbers<\/a> of how Americans report using our time—spending an average of thirty-five minutes on Facebook each day, fifteen minutes on Instagram, and so on—we’re bound to spend five years and four months of our lifetime on social media alone. Maybe that doesn’t seem like a lot, until you consider that it’s more than the time we spend over our entire lifetime on showering and eating combined. Adding in the amount of time people watch TV or stream video, we will on average spend thirteen years watching stories&nbsp;that aren’t ours onscreen, vastly outweighing the four years and eight months we’re spending on eating and drinking or socializing, writing the stories of our own lives.<\/p><p>No wonder many Americans today are looking for a social-media-detox kick. Take a look at current newsstands, and you’ll see a whole new genre of publications that’s aimed toward adding more calm and quiet into our days. With names such as&nbsp;<em>Happinez<\/em> and <em>Breathe<\/em>, these magazines are filled with pages of personal goal-setting, coloring book drawings, and other features that speak to readers’ hunger for slowing down and reevaluating their lives.<\/p><p>I, too, have felt a need for escape from the constant feeling of restlessness that comes with the busyness and hyper-connectedness of a heavy screen-time diet. For me, adding meaning to my life came in the form of much-needed self-care in the face of mental frazzle. I became all too aware of the despair of the never-ending to-do list and also the fact that I’d check off everything related to work and kids’ obligations and never get to the things related to my health, relationships, and well-being. It was taking a toll, and I ultimately learned that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/08/me-time-self-care-brene-brown-healthy-breaks-burnout\">self-care is not selfish<\/a> but actually greatly aids us in our work and personal goals by giving us greater mental bandwidth.<\/p><p>My cup was empty, and I needed to fill it. It started with a trickle; I confided in a girlfriend, and she recommended <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Five-Minute-Journal-Happier-Minutes/dp/0991846206/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1488303127&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=five+minute+journal\"><em>The Five-Minute Journal<\/em><\/a> as one avenue for making moments every day to recollect what I’m grateful for and jot down my hopes. Another friend gave me <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/52-Lists-Project-Journaling-Inspiration/dp/1632170345\"><em>The 52 Lists Project<\/em><\/a>, another journal-type book aimed to spend more mental bandwidth and time on gratitude and creative thoughts. I found a place down the street that plays live big band music every Monday night. After one visit my cup&nbsp;overflowed&nbsp;with nostalgia and endorphins; I started penciling it in for every other week. I began filling quiet moments of nerves with cups of tea instead of clicking on the iPhone; I lit a candle more, read spirituals, and journaled. I set up lunch dates with girlfriends and started sitting down more intentionally with my husband for conversations on topics other than work or home.<\/p><p>These were all little things, and it turns out, just like the elements of hygge, it was the little things that make the biggest difference. If my life is like a meal, these habits have transformed my life in the way spices transform the mundane into a memorable dish. They provide more moments for meaningful inspiration.<\/p><p>Concepts such as hygge may speak to those in North Europe and beyond, but at the end of the day, how we cultivate more moments of illumination and miracles in our day can be as unique as the person living them. For Americans, these may take the form of some of our own traditions; Ben Franklin’s clubs for self-improvement that have been <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2017/01/ben-franklin-meaningful-life-new-years-resolutions\">recently revived<\/a> by the 92nd Street Y and the Hoover Institution come to mind. It can come in the form of listening to quintessentially American big band music or supporting the arts; it can come in the form of a book club or outdoor camping in our numerous national parks. We have the seeds for happiness in America; it’s just up to us to till the soil in our lives.<\/p><p>We may have more stacked against us with the social media and advertising cultures in full force, but we’ve faced and overcome worse struggles. It’s up to us to find a way to add more moments of meaning to our lives, more hours and more days of togetherness and reflection and quiet. Then we’d be more likely to have lives that reflected meaningful narratives about us. The alternative is an endless confetti of meaningless info collected over years—or worse, addictions to a media that consumes <em>us<\/em>.<\/p><p>Rather than let the moments of our lives slip through the unforgiving threshold of an hourglass on activities that don’t fulfill us, we can start today by taking one moment for reflection, and tomorrow, another. As the great American poet Emily Dickinson once said, “If you take care of the small things, the big things take care of themselves. You can gain more control over your life by paying closer attention to the little things.” Here’s to this worthier pursuit.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"http://www.horaceandmae.com/\">Horace and Mae Photography<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202400025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202400025ce","primaryImageId":"ci02049aa360002711","path":"/2017/03/hygge-pursuit-of-happiness-purpose-of-meaning","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01e0a25400009512"},{"$ref":"ci01dfb36c0000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202400025ce"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa60009512"}],"socialPopularity":152,"featuredMediaId":"ci02049aa360002711","slug":"hygge-pursuit-of-happiness-purpose-of-meaning","contentNodeId":"cn020471d750002711","authorProfile":{"$ref":"ci01cec0ac3000efe2"},"teaser":"Why the pursuit of happiness eludes many Americans","promoTitle":"Americans Need to Come Up with Our Own Form of Hygge","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":1.19905e-27,"velocity":1.24476e-20,"estimate":17.3164,"lastCount":9},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":8.57052,"lastCount":7},"facebook":{"acceleration":-1.21224e-27,"velocity":0,"estimate":139.258,"lastCount":136},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0}},"dek":"Why the pursuit of happiness eludes many Americans","featuredMedia":{"$ref":"ci02049aa360002711"},"ownerId":null},{"isPromoted":false,"authorProfileId":"ci01f59f60500026c4","isInstantArticle":true,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-08-03T14:23:57Z","sectionIds":[["ci020b7202400025ce"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"metaDescription":"","id":"ci01e185a040009512","objectType":"ContentArticle","terms":[{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:41:34Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0dde0009512","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"tv","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:41:34Z","disqusId":"65c70ef2-fd07-11e4-9cea-001ec9b1277e","path":"/tag/tv/","slug":"tv","displayName":"tv"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:37:06Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0cd10039512","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"entertainment","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:37:06Z","disqusId":"c5e829e8-fd06-11e4-88db-002219604568","path":"/tag/entertainment/","slug":"entertainment","displayName":"entertainment"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0ef0001c80a"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:40:53Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0db50002a83","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"news","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:40:53Z","disqusId":"4d67a06a-fd07-11e4-9cea-00221960550f","path":"/tag/news/","slug":"news","displayName":"news"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:48:22Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0f760039512","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"downton abbey","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:48:22Z","disqusId":"593caba0-fd08-11e4-91a9-002219604568","path":"/tag/downton-abbey/","slug":"downton-abbey","displayName":"downton abbey"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:42:36Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0e1c000c80a","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"style icon","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:42:36Z","disqusId":"8ac53cc4-fd07-11e4-b795-0022195fd05d","path":"/tag/style-icon/","slug":"style-icon","displayName":"style icon"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa60009512"}],"isNoindex":false,"title":"In Amazon’s New Fitzgerald Series, Complex Women Bring Old Hollywood to Life","primaryImage":{"height":620,"cloudinaryVersionId":1501700745,"id":"ci02114df0a00026b3","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"LillyCollinsAmazonStudios5","primaryPhotoId":"ci02114df0a00026b3","hasFaces":true,"width":1200,"publicId":"MTQ4OTg1OTU4MjgzMzU1MTkx","format":"jpg","bytes":173539},"isSponsored":false,"editedTimestamp":"2017-08-03T14:23:44Z","disqusId":"275ad3cc-b005-11e5-add2-001ec9b40b46","autoSaved":false,"tmlEmbeds":[],"sectionsLeafNode":["ci020b7202400025ce"],"bodyTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>I have always been a huge fan of period pieces on television, including (though certainly not limited to) <em>Downton Abbey<\/em>, <em>The Crown<\/em>, <em>Call the Midwife<\/em>, and any Jane Austen miniseries. More recently, the Amazon series on the life of Zelda Fitzgerald, <a href=\"https://verilymag.com/2017/01/zelda-fitzgerald-amazon-series-premiere-z-the-beginning-of-everything\"><em>Z: The Beginning of Everything<\/em><\/a>, intrigued me due to my fascination since high school with F. Scott Fitzgerald and the glamorous, conflict-ridden worlds he depicted in his works in the 1920s and thirties. Naturally, then, when I heard that Amazon would be releasing a new series based on Fitzgerald’s&nbsp;last, unfinished novel, <em>The Last Tycoon<\/em>, I made time to binge watch it immediately. This second Fitzgerald period drama by Amazon premiered on Friday with a nine-episode season; while not quite perfection, it did not disappoint.<\/p><p><em>The Last Tycoon<\/em> chronicles the life of film executive Monroe Stahr (played by Matt Bomer) in the mid-1930s as he maneuvers his own personal troubles, his relationships with others, and his power struggle with his boss, studio head Pat Brady (played by Kelsey Grammer). However, while these two men may have the leading roles, to me it was the female characters who gave the series life and depth.&nbsp;Nearly all of the women portrayed in this period drama are strong-willed female roles; they all assert themselves as equal to men.<\/p><p>Lily Collins plays Pat’s 19-year-old daughter, Celia Brady, who proves to be so much more than just the boss’s daughter. I couldn’t help but compare her to Lady Sybil in <em>Downton Abbey<\/em>, as Celia shares her ambition and her compassion for those less fortunate than she. Yes, she is young and naive and a little boy crazy, but she is, nonetheless, a strong, brave young woman who goes against the grain to do what’s right.<\/p><p>Similarly, the other women in this series, though at times reveling in the alcohol- and sex-heavy lifestyle Fitzgerald was known to live and write about, prove themselves to be more than just pretty faces or passive puppets.<\/p><p>Margo Taft, the golden-age, shallow, wanton actress played by Jennifer Beals, is a character rich in sordid family secrets and personal identity anguish.&nbsp;Kathleen Moore, the beautiful and fiery Irish immigrant played by Dominique McElligott, is a café waitress who catches Stahr’s eye, reminding him of his dead wife. She’s a tricky character who left me confused at times, but what unfolds for her offers a thought-provoking exploration of character and values that was paramount in my other favorite period shows such as <em>Downton<\/em>. Rose Brady, Pat’s wife (played by Rosemarie DeWitt), rounds out the female cast and is, to me, the character most like the typical, conflicted Fitzgerald characters. She mistakenly searches for love and happiness in an extramarital affair with Stahr and, unsurprisingly, does not find it there.<\/p><p>Following each character’s story brought me back to a question I often ask myself: Why do I always find Fitzgerald and the stories he created so wonderfully intriguing? Beals seemed to capture exactly why in a <a href=\"http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a10385744/jennifer-beals-interview-the-last-tycoon/\">recent interview<\/a>:&nbsp;“he had his finger on the conflict between who we would fantasize that we are and who we actually are.”&nbsp;Sometimes we believe that to find happiness, we have to become like someone whom we think&nbsp;“has it all.”&nbsp;However, most people who get to that place and do&nbsp;“have it all”&nbsp;still come up short. This irony&nbsp;is what Fitzgerald exposes (and, according to historical accounts, experienced in his personal life), and that<em> <\/em>is why we continue to obsess over his works.<\/p><p>Fitzgerald’s story brought to life&nbsp;turned out to be just what I was hoping for. It transports you into the wild life of 1930s Hollywood while still giving you a feel for the historical troubles of the times, such as the Great Depression, the creation of early unions, and the rise of Nazi Germany. The story line also delicately deals with enduring issues such as immigration, sexism, and racism.<\/p><p><em>The Last Tycoon<\/em> has been compared to a host of other period-piece dramas by critics, including the famed 1960s period drama <em>Mad Men<\/em>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/arts/television/f-scott-fitzgerald-the-last-tycoon-amazon.html\">more than forty<\/a>&nbsp;former <em>Mad Men<\/em> crew members are even working on this new show).&nbsp;And some have billed&nbsp;<em>The Last Tycoon<\/em>&nbsp;as being beautiful but lacking passion.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>My only problems with the show is more with the fact that it's overly sexualized at times with nudity and promiscuity; the women characters, while each inspiring and praiseworthy in some way, do not need the sexual allusions to make them complete.<\/p><p>We will just have to wait and see whether it actually becomes a viable long-term series—the next <em>Mad Men<\/em> or <em>Downton Abbey<\/em>. But just as we saw the Crowley women dominate some of <em>Downton<\/em>’s best plot lines, and the likes of Peggy Olson and even Sally Draper rise to the top of their casts, I think <em>The Last Tycoon<\/em> offers an intriguing story of the complexities of what it means to be a woman, both then and now.&nbsp;Honestly, much like these other dramas, I think the new show’s success will come down to how the female characters are drawn out—as pawns or as real players on the chessboard called Hollywood. For now, it seems to be on the right track.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: Amazon Studios<\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202400025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202400025ce","primaryImageId":"ci02114df0a00026b3","path":"/2017/08/the-last-tycoon-fitzgerald-amazon-downton-abbey-mad-men-08032017","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01cec0dde0009512"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202400025ce"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0cd10039512"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0ef0001c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0db50002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0f760039512"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0e1c000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa60009512"}],"socialPopularity":103,"featuredMediaId":"ci02114df0a00026b3","slug":"the-last-tycoon-fitzgerald-amazon-downton-abbey-mad-men-08032017","contentNodeId":"cn01e185a040009512","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2016-08-31T20:16:56Z","authorProfileId":"ci01cec0ac3000efe2","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2016-08-31T20:16:56Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01f59f60500026c4","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","isNoindex":false,"title":"Madeleine Coyne","slug":"mcoyne","disqusId":"d94a89a0-6fb6-11e6-8262-0294a49d680d","bio":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" -->","path":"/author/mcoyne"},"teaser":"‘The Last Tycoon’ will feel pleasantly familiar to some ‘Downton Abbey’ and ‘Mad Men’ fans.","promoTitle":"In Amazon’s New Fitzgerald Series, Complex Women Bring Old Hollywood to Life","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":1.46347,"lastCount":1},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"facebook":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":102.78,"lastCount":102},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0}},"dek":"‘The Last Tycoon’ will feel pleasantly familiar to some ‘Downton Abbey’ and ‘Mad Men’ fans.","featuredMedia":{"$ref":"ci02114df0a00026b3"},"ownerId":null}],"moreResultsToken":"OTo5OjVkMGRhZWYwMzIwNjY2M2Q5MjQxYzM2ZWJmYzA1NDg4"},"meta":["image","body","A","label"],"isCanvas":true,"promoted":true,"type":"phxStandardTileHub","preloaded":true,"objectType":"config"}</script>
