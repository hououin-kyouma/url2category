      <h2 class="subtitle">Pursuing Your Passion and Purpose</h2>
      <div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_12148271">
       <p>If you aspire to have a spiritually based profession, whereby you are helping others and bringing enlightenment, healing and love to the world, be encouraged to follow your passion. It is a sign of your destiny and soul path – and is time to begin!</p> 
       <p>Each person has a personal soul mission or life purpose. This mission is something you agreed to undertake and learn during this lifetime prior to incarnating. Lessons may include such themes as learning to be compassionate, self-reliant, a leader, or about forgiveness, patience or sharing with others. There is any number of these soul growth lessons for us to learn and each of us has our own set of life themes and lessons.</p> 
       <p>In addition to their own personal soul missions, some people agreed to take on a ‘global’ or ‘Universal’ mission which may involve helping other people, the environment, campaigning passionately about a cause or two (or more), helping and caring for animals and/or working for humanity’s benefit in general.</p> 
       <p>These souls/people are known by a variety of names such as Lightworkers, Star Seeds, Earth Angels, Indigos and Crystals amongst others. They come in the form of healers, teachers, authors and speakers, whose primary goal is to enlighten and assist others.</p> 
       <p>When you are a Lightworker your higher-self and soul KNOW you are, whether your conscious mind realizes it (yet) or not.</p> 
       <p>Lightworkers, Star Seeds, Earth Angels etc feel a sense of purpose, a compulsion to help others and have a genuine love of the world and all it encompasses. They naturally attract people in need of help, and are innately sensitive to the needs of others. At times they may feel overwhelmed by others’ energies as they are so sensitive.</p> 
       <p>Lightworkers are aware that there is something important that they are destined to do during their lifetime. Although they may not be sure of what they may entail, they know within that they will be shown and guided in divine right time.</p> 
       <p>For some there may be a sense of urgency, as though there is so much to do, but not enough time to do it all. Follow this urge and get on with it!</p> 
       <p>The main soul or life purpose of Lightworkers is to extend and send out divine love and healing. Radiating this healing light and energy naturally brings peace and love wherever they go. All that a Lightworker does is done with divine unconditional love.</p> 
       <p>Whether you are a spiritual teacher, life coach, author, speaker, healer or any other spiritual facilitator, the most necessary ingredient is that divine spark of love infused with and into your work.</p> 
       <p>When considering your spiritual profession take a look at your passions. You may need to define your particular niche so have a look at your hobbies, your beliefs and values and WHO you really are.</p> 
       <p>What topics truly excite and motivate you? What are you naturally/divinely good at? Are you a talented writer, a brilliant public speaker, or are you naturally drawn towards the healing arts? Maybe you are a dab-hand at all of them. What is your topic or focus? What will you teach, write or speak about?</p> 
       <p>Listen to your intuition, inner-voice and your heart. Listen to your Higher Self as it already knows. Your feelings, when beginning or pursuing a career within the spiritual professions, is your best guide.</p> 
       <p>Make sure you put your heart and soul into your work. Being genuinely passionate about what you do keeps the momentum and enthusiasm flowing.</p> 
       <p><strong>SELF CONFIDENCE, FAITH AND TRUST</strong></p> 
       <p>That compulsive urge and/or dream of becoming a spiritual facilitator is much more than just an idea - it is a sign.</p> 
       <p>Often what holds many back from pursuing a spiritually based career is a ‘fear’ of lack. The questions raised may be along the lines of “how will I be able to support myself and my family financially?” “If I quit my day job will I be able to survive financially?” “What would people think and say?”</p> 
       <p>Many people hesitate becoming public speakers, healers and teachers due to fear of ridicule, rejection and/or ostracism. Yes, there will be those who will criticize and judge you - but that happens regardless of whatever path you take, and there will always be those who dwell in the negative. Continue along your path regardless. Don’t listen to nay-sayers or negative, unsupportive people.</p> 
       <p>These are common stumbling blocks - but ones which can be overcome with a little faith and trust in the Universe. When you are on your true soul mission, TRUST that all you need will come to you in divine right time. You’ll attract the people who you are to work with, the appropriate clients or students and the appropriate environment.</p> 
       <p>When we love our work, everything else falls into place. When you genuinely love what you do your main focus is not money-based but rather love-based - and the Universe will take care of the rest.</p> 
       <p>"<em>When a man is willing and eager, the gods join in."</em> <br><strong>- Aeschylus</strong></p> 
       <p>So, becoming a ‘professional’ spiritual worker entails being paid appropriately and fairly. Many Lightworkers have trouble accepting money for the work they do. The idea is uncomfortable to them as their only desire is to shed their divine love and light. Consciously, money doesn’t enter into it. Those who are uncomfortable with the idea of accepting payment for spiritual work are often those who subconsciously recall past lives when many lived in communal or kibbutz type settings. In those times all food and shelter was provided for them, leaving one free to focus on their spiritual practice without concern for the need to derive an income.</p> 
       <p>In today’s world though, we need an income to pay our bills, rent, mortgage, transportation and day to day living expenses. How can you expect to run a business (and your life) without the appropriate resources?</p> 
       <p>People around the world go off to their ‘jobs’ everyday with the knowledge that they will be paid for their efforts. Why should it be any different for you? Many people are paid an hourly rate or a salary for the work they do - that’s <em>why</em> they go to work. Why should that be any different for those who work in the spiritual fields? Your payment for the work you do is no different to that of any other healer, such as nurses, doctors and the like.</p> 
       <p>Making money from the work you do is in line with the Universal Spiritual Law of Giving and Receiving. The energy and vibration of your <strong><em>intentions</em></strong> will dictate the viability of your spiritual endeavour. If you enter a spiritually based career with the sole intent of making money and/or finding fame, then you are most likely to fail. It is appropriate to earn an income from your spiritual work, but it can <strong>not</strong> be your main focal point.</p> 
       <p>Some Lightworkers suffer from being shy, timid, lack self-confidence or are indecisive. This is ‘fear’ based and may stop them in their tracks. This is where the Universal Spiritual Law of Action comes into play. This law states that when you take action in the direction of your soul purpose (no matter how small that step may be) the Universe will take greater action in your desired direction, supporting your goal and encouraging further positive action on your behalf.</p> 
       <p>By taking action in the direction of your aspirations you are making a commitment to yourself and something that is of the utmost importance to you - and is of benefit to the world around you. That action step can be large or small – it doesn’t matter as long as it is a positive step forward. The Universe reacts and responds to your intentions, so any step or action you take in the direction of becoming and ‘being’ a professional spiritual healer/teacher/writer/speaker will be a declaration of your intentions. Trust the Universe to open the right doors for you.</p> 
       <p>So it’s time to take action – NOW!</p> 
       <p>The best and most authentic way to teach (in all its’ forms) is to live your life in accordance with your principles and values. Live your life as a role model of what you are teaching. Walk your talk and talk your walk.</p> 
       <p>Allow people to familiarize themselves with you prior to booking an appointment. This can be achieved in many ways such as by writing an article for a metaphysical/New Age magazine in print or on the internet; set up a website or blog and write a short biography about yourself and the services you offer; organize and run a workshop; use word-of-mouth, and of course, keep a positive focus and attitude. The Universe will respond in kind by providing your audience.</p> 
       <p>Visualize yourself living your spiritual career right now. Bring it into the present rather than some far-flung time in the future. Visualizing it happening in the future rather than in the present keeps it in the future. Visualizations and affirmations are very powerful tools to utilize when bringing your dreams to fruition. Affirming your intentions is an integral part of engaging the laws of the Universe. Visualizing, affirming and taking action steps bring the reality of your successful and fulfilling spiritual practice to the forefront, in the present moment. Declare it to the Universe today.</p> 
       <p>Present yourself and your spiritual services to the public and have faith and trust that the Universe will send you appropriate opportunities.</p> 
       <p>When you put your efforts, heart and soul into giving someone a spiritual reading, a healing, are running a workshop or giving a counselling session, it is appropriate that you receive something in exchange. This is important in regards to living a balanced life.</p> 
       <p>When you give, give, give and keep giving of yourself your energies become depleted and enthusiasm and passion wain. It is vital to balance the ‘giving’ with an equal measure of ‘receiving’. This is a <em>need</em> of basic human life. Do not deny yourself what you deserve and require as this is undermining yourself in every way.</p> 
       <p>If you only give out and do not allow yourself to receive, eventually you will begin to have feelings of resentment, of being bound, burnt-out and drained of energy. Deep down you’ll wish that others would acknowledge and fulfil your needs - but if you do not clearly stipulate those needs, then others will be unaware of them. This can become an on-going cycle - therefore it is important for all involved to be clear on what is required on behalf of both parties.</p> 
       <p>When someone requests a reading or appointment with you, make sure that you are clear about your needs (eg. Fees). If they choose not to book because they do not wish to pay a fee for your services, that is <em>their</em> choice. Do NOT sell yourself short.</p> 
       <p>On the flip-side, many people <strong><em>want</em></strong> to pay you for your services. They are thankful for and appreciate your loving help, guidance and/or healing, and genuinely wish to reward you. Not accepting their ‘gift of exchange’ can be seen as a bit of a rebuff, and may lead your client or student to feel unnecessarily indebted to you. They may even feel ‘guilty’ about taking from you and not being able to give back in return.</p> 
       <p>By accepting payment for your spiritual services you and your client/student are performing a balanced exchange of energy. The giving of yourself is balanced out by receiving the payment. Your client values your services, as in order to have received them they have had to exchange something of value.</p> 
       <p>When you accept payment for your services you are being supported. The income allows you to focus and devote more of your time and efforts to your spiritual practice. If you do not accept payment and cannot derive an appropriate income you will be needing to spend your valuable time and energy at a job to earn money. This detracts from your soul purpose.</p> 
       <p>Of course there will always be the odd occasion when your soul urges you to help, guide and/or heal, with payment being irrelevant. You’ll intuitively know when these situations arise and will proceed accordingly. Although no payment may change hands, you’ll be racking up some bonus good karma along the way.</p> 
       <p>It is of the utmost importance to yourself, your clients/students and your spiritual practice that you <strong>receive</strong> with thanks and gratitude.</p> 
       <p>**</p> 
       <p>Your purpose and soul mission as a spiritual practitioner (in all forms) is a life-long commitment - one that will bring healing, joy and rewards to yourself, others and the world. Along the way you’ll be sharing and sending out blessings, love and light to all ...</p> 
       <p><strong>LIVE</strong> and <strong>LOVE</strong> your spiritual career today!</p>

           <p class="">I have been drawn to the cards for decades now. I have battled spiritually as to whether or not they are permissible. I was raised "Christian" and was told the cards are "spirits" and I should not consult them. But I still wanted to and did. I have gone through phases when I threw away my deck and I felt like part of me was leaving each time, physically as well as spiritually. So I stopped doing that and found a deck, which I love and respect. I have never asked others if I can read for them and most do not know I have an alter, but for some reason, in some strange way, the topic comes up somehow. Then, they ask for a reading. I have received my first "love offering" not so long ago. I was shocked and pleased. Then I have had an experience where someone "forced" me to do a reading for them and the next day and part of the day after that, I can honestly say, I was spiritually void. I had no feelings of any kind. I did some research and found that this can happen. I learned to say no and mean it. Long story, short...I can across your page after watching a youtube video about these tones I have been hearing since I was a child. I tried to use science to explain it, but I never believed that. Now, I look forward to them. I keep getting "the call" and am scared of being looked at by my family and yes, I need to support my kids. I do not know how to take the next step, but I receive it will be given to me in a big positive way.</p>
           <p class="">Thank you for all you do, have done, and will do. You are a key. We appreciate you more than you will ever know in this life. Thank you.</p>
           <p class="">Sincerely,</p>

           <p class="">Joanne. . . Are you still around? I see that these comments are 6 years old. I am ready to speak; now, today. It is not exactly what I want to do... It is what I am, who I am. I have held back. Basically I need advice on exactly where to start... I know nothing of computers. Should I look for "open mics" or places hiring teachers? I have no official credential... I have listened to and sat under divers masters but what I have to give comes from the Source. If anybody gives me a chance they will not be disappointed.</p>

           <p class="">I just really wanted to say thank you so much. This was so unexpected, all I know is that im reading an angel number one min and then the next im here. I understand now that this was a message from my angels. Im only 17 and I have this urge to help people. I would love to teach but not only teach but learn from people too. I want to travel the world. Its what I've always wanted to do and now I know that that can happen. Will show this to my mother! Thanks so much.</p>

           <p class="">Joanne, I am forever grateful to you for writing this 6 years ago and posting it online. About a year ago, I began my own spiritual awakening process began and in the past 4 months or so I've awakened into an entirely new world. Nothing is the same as it was before, I feel more childlike awe and wonder in my awareness than I did as a child. Since my awakening, I realized that dedicating one's self to slave away countless hours towards a cause they don't care about just for money is no way to spend this extremely breif life. Nonetheless, I still recognize I need money since I would rather not be homeless. And so for months and months I searched within for my calling and was getting no clear answers. Then eventually through my meditations, I realized it was perfectly okay to not know and that if I stopped searching, my calling would find me. So more months go by and in this past week I'm in between jobs. I got a job lined up that many of my friends and family were excited to hear I obtained. Then they were shocked to find out I ended up turning the job down because I wanted to only work part time in order to be able to place more focus on my spiritual path. My heart just wasn't in the job at all and at this point I can no longer tolerate 40+ hours a week of doing something my heart isn't behind. The lack of support for this decision did hurt me a bit, but I'm fine with that, sometimes we just have to do what we need to regardless of what others tell us. Yesterday while I was at a coffee shop, I overheard an older women talking about her work as a spiritual teacher. It had never occured to me this was a viable option for myself, but it totally is. Then today I come across this article. Is the Universe giving me signs? Yes, big flashing neon ones I just can't miss. After I read your article, I literally broke down crying tears of pure joy. Never in my life had I experienced what it was like to understand your life's calling. The feeling is indescribable and I know it's my soul pointing me down this path with this feeling. I feel more motivated than I ever have in my life to start my soul mission to bring light to the Universe. I can't wait to start spreading all this love and positivity inside me like a wildfire. Not sure if you're still reading these, but reading your article was no accident and the vibration of your words resonated with so much I just have to let you know that I'm never going to forget these beautiful words you've strung together and you've made a huge impact on my life.</p>
           <p class="">Peace, love and light to you!</p>

           <p class="">Hi Joanne, don't even know how I landed on your blog, but you brilliantly wrote what I wanted to hear. Most likelly, you echoed what my heart was wispering to me and to many others, being that we are "ONE" behind our minds.. Actually, just came back from a familly reunion for my dear mother's birthday and was just inquiring to my sisters son, who is a 16 year old computer wiz, on how to create a blog. I'm a Spiritual seeker since I entered this world and a car hauler to make ends meet, but I have this urge to do what I really came here to do, and something inside is pushing me to do so on a full time basis. You are the proof that we are all connected even though the clouds of our mind sometimes hide the sunshine of our Soul. We can all fly in our dreams, so if we are not capable of doing so at this moment, are we not ETERNAL Souls dreaming that we are not? Thank you, and sending you skies filled with AWARENESS!</p>

           <p class="">Hello Joanne, thank you for your article! My soul mission is concerned with giving people a job helping others. I have enough people in my network who 'happen to be ' jobless, but I have no money to pay them with, so i am considering starting a business first. I am curious how this pans out!</p>

           <p class="">Fabulous article! I have had my own business for some time! With great passion helping others, and success.</p>
           <p class="">In between I was diagnosed with Cancer and faced challenges myself. Thank God I overcame the challenges I faced, although I was not able to work for along time.</p>
           <p class="">Now I am able to work and need financial stability. I do not know what to do at this time, with the economy and people who want help, but are not willing to pay for the help.</p>
           <p class="">A friend of mine took a course for 6 months to get certified as a Health Coach. She was in debt for many reasons and took out another credit card, which I will not do!</p>
           <p class="">I am trying to figure out how to use my gifts, studies, etc. and get started again. I even went for a "regular job," and several interviews. Unfortunately when one gets to a certain age employers do not seem to want to hire you!</p>
           <p class="">I live in a community that has a lot of people who are in the healing field. Each of us are different as stated in the article. I just need some insight as how to get started again.</p>

           <p class="">Hey</p>
           <p class="">Thank you for sharing this article. I stumbled upon this at a perfect time. I've been tuning into my spiritual self off late and am at a crossroads (having just graduated from college) where I feel like I HAVE to help other individuals, and specifically create more awareness on the importance of helping heal the Earth and at the same time, I need to start earning to support myself and my family. Living in India, I see a lot of pollution - land, air, noise and water, and that hurts me. I have this urge to do something and to do something big - but I really don;t know where to start. I would love any input or guidance on how to go about making healing a career. I am planning to join a course to learn pranic healing. Is there more I can do/ go about to take this forward?</p>
           <p class="">Abundant light, love and Peace to everyone.</p>

           <p class="">I have two visions, but they don't necessarily have to be separate things. I want to help other women. Specifically, because of all the pain they have caused to me and loved ones, I want to support the changes in life women go through. I don't just mean menopause. I mean going from single to married or going from a little kid through teenager those kinds of things. My resources are practically nonexistent. I do have one thing I can use . My skills in speaking, or writing. I would also like to set up a buy sell trade shop in my hometown on the bus line where women who may not normally feel comfortable talking to each other can go and feel like it's a safe place to ask stupid questions. A place where negativity is discouraged by all. I have a lot of stuff to write but I don't have patients to use my hand and a pen or a keyboard. It's usually easiest if I can just dictate my concerns. I need to figure out how to do a podcast or radio show I tried blogging, however, Breaking everything up into paragraphs and making it all concise and flow doesn't fit with my day-to-day life. A talk show of some sort on the radio would be what I would prefer</p>

           <p class="">Awesome and Funny I just find this hub now. I am one who has mentored MANY over the years... the Dif between a mentor and a coach - "a coach is paid." .... I am running my first workshop on June 10th - 2015 (put the date as others may find this hub 4 years from now and really get a laugh like I did) ........ and getting paid has been an issue I wrestled with greatly... LOL</p>
           <p class="">Thanks for the encouragement and recognition I am on the right path.</p>
           <p class="">Thumbs Up and will share. Namaste</p>

           <p class="">Wonderful information. I have numbers following me my whole life. After my mom passed Jan 2014 I was broken. Now my perception on everyone and everything is different. I know I have always been gifted and 'different'. I thank you for shining your light out to all us light workers. This is exactly what I needed to read to get me going. I look forward to reading more from you!</p>

           <p class="">It never ceases to amaze me when I receive a message at precisely the moment I feel I need it. I didn't stumble across this article...my Angels guided me here. I know there's no coincidence, no luck, no accidents. We are always and forever right where we need to be. Lately, I have felt stuck, stagnated by fear and tossed ragged by the storms of indecision raging inside my mind. Only when I became quiet enough, surrendering the endless battle with Ego was I able to receive exactly the guidance I needed. You are one of my earth Angels!! With all my Heart, Love, Soul, Mind and the deepest of Gratitude - Thank You!!</p>

           <p class="">Hi Joanne</p>
           <p class="">Thank you for helping me to understand how to tune into myself and affirm my intuitive insights via numerology. Through sacredscribes I have been able to decode the messages from my angels and affirm what my gut instincts have told me.</p>
           <p class="">My spiritual knowledge had increased ten fold thanks to your knowledge and beautiful blogs.</p>
           <p class="">Can you tell me if your sacred scribes website is still operating as from today I'm getting a message the site has been removed?</p>

           <p class="">I have felt very disoriented since my mother passed on 12/13/13. I noticed alot of number patterns &amp; have never really looked into numerology. I wrote all of these patterns down &amp; have been trying to keep up with them all. I have a great sense of "Needing to notifying." Just can't seem to make the sense flow yet.

           <p class="">i think the reason why it's not ok to charge is because when you introduce money you start to block out the people that actually need your assistance but now "can't afford" it. Spiritual aid shouldn't be linked to money for this specific purpose. the people who's powers and abilities are strongest are the ones that never charge money for their work. they just help people. For free, because the person needs it and they are strongly called to them. It's across the board. Money may taint your abilities if not wane them all together.</p>

           <p class="">Joanne, I feel so much gratitude for your brave pursuit of that which beckons you to share your gifts with others, and to bear your torch for all to see. Light workers such as yourself illuminate pathways beyond the darkness of apprehension and self doubt with such brilliance and optimism. Standing in the spotlight can be quite a frightening and vulnerable experience. To follow our own inner wisdom as it resonates with the wisdom perceived through divine Youniversal energies which we cannot see with our two eyes, only perceive with our one... and feel with our hearts ... well I've come to realize that it sometimes requires us to step out and in a sense become the spotlight ourselves. Thank you for your inspiration, encouragement and for the warm reminders that when we do eventually get there, we will after all find ourselves in a crowd of many other spotlights anyway :p</p>
           <p class="">Keep Shining Bright!!</p>

           <p class="">I thought your blog was insightful. A couple things to ponder: Today's world is a figament of one person's perception/imagination. Communal models---otherwise known as Intentional Communities still exist and are quite functional. Check out Damanhur in Europe and Yogaville in Virginia. Some soul contracts demand that money and energy exchange be handled very carefully. Egoic behavior is the human obstacle course. Spiritual education always preceeds the material (Illusion called Maya) world. So...perhaps...those spiritual workers have a bigger calling than how the world currently views and uses money (mammon). I whole heartedly believe in "getting out there" and finding the correct path of prosperity and wealth thinking and action. I just think there some big things that impede people from making it all happen the way our conscious mind wants it to. Some people---especially wounded healers---need healing (all the way to the soul level if necessary) before stepping too far into the arena as a career. There are countless drawbacks that prevent a lot of career expansions. Nevertheless...thanks for encouraging Light Workers to empower themselves and others.</p>

           <p class="">Great article Joanne! I thank you so much for your words of encouragement and clear explanation. I quit my job one year ago next month and feel compelled to start working again due to our financial status at the present time. Although I have a need, our Angels have been communicating to me time and time again that I should consider taking a job in anything that will expand my spirituality. I try to do this on a day to day basis, as spirituality is all the areas of your life, paid or unpaid. But now I feel I'd like to still get paid, but have a fufilling life in a spiritually based profession. What do you think?</p>

           <p class="">This is one of the things that I have "battled" with more than anything. A big part of the reason is because me following the path that's in my heart will indeed ruffle the feathers of those that I grew up with. Not because my beliefs are totally different now, but because God is teaching me a new language. It is like a divine revelation of how things ALL flow together. My dialect and language may not sound "correct" to them. This is what I think I have feared. Soooo.... I have been trying to find loop holes. I have been teaching, writing, supporting, coaching, etc. but it is not been to the fullest like I believe I am chosen to do.</p>
           <p class="">Thank you for the article Joanne. It was confirmation on a lot of levels. Even the part about accepting money for my services. :-)</p>

           <p class="">My brother was just told that he is a light worker. I had never heard that term before but after doing some research and reading this hub I believe that I too am a light worker. I have a life path of 6 but I'm still confused as to how I'm supposed to help people....and I'm so anxious to know the answer!!! Thank you for this informative hub..I truly enjoyed the read.</p>

           <p class="">Also my Pastor just thinks is all just noise, I feel so out of place when I go to church. I feel ashamed because my Pastor looks at me like, what does she know.. Well I have new fruit, new covenant and not the old. Joanne your encouraging words really impacted my life, I really didn't know which way I should go on my spiritual journey. My life has changed, now I don't want anything of the world, for dear life all I want to do is the will and works of the higher Spirit of the Universe. Joanne this world need people to stand up and spread life into every living soul. I'm a strong voice for God, I must stand and shine light on every dark place. I don't know my next move, God saved my life and now I live for him. I heard God 1/14/2011 after that I. Left everything, no more bondage, pain GONE! I quit my miserable 08/30/2011 finally after many years of strongholds. I'm free God said to me last year, today I still follow him, my life has never been the same, I ran out of myself, now I see. My prison mind is dead, its forever shut down, CLOSED. Now Joanne I thank you for your wonderful words of life, God bless your socks OFF. You are a beautiful ANGEL FROM HEAVEN...</p>

           <p class="">Outstanding hub, I've been searching for months on why i've been overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit since January 14th 2011. Everything after that, the Spirit continues to speak especially while when my stomach is empty, fasting. He speaks heavy, He knows I want it BAD. Its beautiful, its a place I've neven been before, its beautiful. However I'm safe there, im at peace there, also in the spirit and in truth the Spirit opens the word to me, i cannot explain it, its so amazing. Now when i read the bible reading in the spirit, the words are not in the carnal anymore. Its no longer mysteries nor parables, Gods word unvealed. This taste God shared with me i crave for daily, i want more. I just cant get enough, when i got to church and sunday school, my Paster's sermons are past behind, thats Gods very own words. I cannot lie, is there anyone out there hungry like me. No one wants to be fed NEW FRUIT</p>

           <p class="">This is good advice. I write on 3 sites, and on HP mostly to teach others to do Astrology on their own. I've been deluged with people wanting answers to problems. I do charts the old way, but just ordered software. My issue is that people ask questions on here and other sies which waste my time for hours. When they find they must pay, I never hear from them. To hand calculate it took me 7 hrs. on one I did last week, for $25. I'm taking a break to get used to the program I ordered, and have to write realistic rules for people who want my services. I think exchaning money is fine, but it isn't a license for the person to ask you personal questions about their lives forever and expect answers. I have actually gotten stuff like, "Sun in Pisces, Capricorn moon, what can you tell me?" Today I got a women who gave me no info, except she is 50, her life is falling apart, what should she do? I'm not a full blown psychic, and although sympathetic, think that's just rude. I had an Indian man who assured me if I read 2 YEARS of stuff for him, he would recommend me to all his friends. Great, hours of free work and many more like him. I've written over 50 metaphysical hubs on here, and if they read many of them they could answer their own questions. Sorry to vent. I think tarot readings online or by phone are BS, there is no way to get the person's vibrations in the cards by shuffling. It's hard to separate the spiritual seekers from people who want something for nothing. They don't even want to do enough inner work to describe their problems. I've written What Astrology Can't Tell You and Fake Spirituality, I'm coming out of a few negative weeks. Maybe when Mercury goes direct this will change. Thanks for the hub!!</p>

           <p class="">Joanne, this is a great article, very insightful and informative. I am a medium by birth, but I've come to realize that it's not meant to be my source of income in this life. The only times I get to say what I see is when I'm handed the information, and it usually happens when least expected - while waiting in line at the supermarket, etc. If I try to do a reading on someone, unless that person has a vibration that is compatible with mine, I go completely blank! I'm sure that it's something that can be developed with a lot of practice, but I will continue using it as a form to communicate with my loved ones, and spirit guides, and to deliver a message whenever it's given to me to do so.</p>
           <p class="">I enjoyed your writing very much. Thank you!</p>

           <p class="">Enjoyed reading this hub article very much and have bookmarked it for future reference.</p>
           <p class="">Greetings from across the 'big paddock' we Aussie's call The Nullabour. It looks like I may have just found myself a worldly-guide to help me on my spiritual quest and I look forward to reading your words of wisdom both on HubPages and on your website.</p>

           <p class="">Hi Wayne, thanks for your positive comments. I have read your Hubs (and am a 'follower' of yours,)and they too have resonated with me. Interesting how 'like attracts like', and I am in agreeance with you that when positive energy is authentic, we receive it in kind. My motivations are to encourage others to live their truths with integrity and passion in their lives, so they too can reap the rewards on offer by the Universal energies.</p>
           <p class="">Blessings to you Wayne,</p>

           <p class="">Joanne, your blog really spoke to me. I felt an uncanny attraction to the words. I felt the positive energy radiating throughout and was inspired by your words. Recently I created a hubpage and starting blogging. Writing has become a true passion of mine. Due to my disability and early retirement from a successful career, I have an abundance of time. I love interacting with people (I was a stockbroker in my previous career) and helping them achieve their goals. I do feel like I'm that lightworker you spoke of and consider myself to be very spiritual. The laws of attraction are real and powerful. It proven that to me many times in my life. If you exude positive energy that is authentic, you will receive it back many time over.</p>

I have battled spiritually as to whether or not they are permissible. I was raised \"Christian\" and was told the cards are \"spirits\" and I should not consult them. But I still wanted to and did. I have gone through phases when I threw away my deck and I felt like part of me was leaving each time, physically as well as spiritually. So I stopped doing that and found a deck, which I love and respect. I have never asked others if I can read for them and most do not know I have an alter, but for some reason, in some strange way, the topic comes up somehow. Then, they ask for a reading. I have received my first \"love offering\" not so long ago. I was shocked and pleased. Then I have had an experience where someone \"forced\" me to do a reading for them and the next day and part of the day after that, I can honestly say, I was spiritually void. I had no feelings of any kind. I did some research and found that this can happen. I learned to say no and mean it. Long story, short...I can across your page after watching a youtube video about these tones I have been hearing since I was a child. I tried to use science to explain it, but I never believed that. Now, I look forward to them. I keep getting \"the call\" and am scared of being looked at by my family and yes, I need to support my kids. I do not know how to take the next step, but I receive it will be given to me in a big positive way.\nThank you for all you do, have done, and will do. You are a key. We appreciate you more than you will ever know in this life.  Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nVictoria C. B.

About a year ago, I began my own spiritual awakening process began and in the past 4 months or so I've awakened into an entirely new world. Nothing is the same as it was before, I feel more childlike awe and wonder in my awareness than I did as a child. Since my awakening, I realized that dedicating one's self to slave away countless hours towards a cause they don't care about just for money is no way to spend this extremely breif life. Nonetheless, I still recognize I need money since I would rather not be homeless. And so for months and months I searched within for my calling and was getting no clear answers. Then eventually through my meditations, I realized it was perfectly okay to not know and that if I stopped searching, my calling would find me. So more months go by and in this past week I'm in between jobs. I got a job lined up that many of my friends and family were excited to hear I obtained. Then they were shocked to find out I ended up turning the job down because I wanted to only work part time in order to be able to place more focus on my spiritual path. My heart just wasn't in the job at all and at this point I can no longer tolerate 40+ hours a week of doing something my heart isn't behind. The lack of support for this decision did hurt me a bit, but I'm fine with that, sometimes we just have to do what we need to regardless of what others tell us. Yesterday while I was at a coffee shop, I overheard an older women talking about her work as a spiritual teacher. It had never occured to me this was a viable option for myself, but it totally is. Then today I come across this article. Is the Universe giving me signs? Yes, big flashing neon ones I just can't miss. After I read your article, I literally broke down crying tears of pure joy. Never in my life had I experienced what it was like to understand your life's calling. The feeling is indescribable and I know it's my soul pointing me down this path with this feeling. I feel more motivated than I ever have in my life to start my soul mission to bring light to the Universe. I can't wait to start spreading all this love and positivity inside me like a wildfire. Not sure if you're still reading these, but reading your article was no accident and the vibration of your words resonated with so much I just have to let you know that I'm never going to forget these beautiful words you've strung together and you've made a huge impact on my life.\n\nPeace, love and light to you!\n\n"},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"dev"},"datePublished":"2017-06-18T10:40:01-07:00","text":"simply loved the article , away some guidance and i felt a complete peace ......

You are the proof that we are all connected even though the clouds of our mind sometimes hide the sunshine of our Soul.

My skills in speaking, or writing.   I would also like to set up a buy sell trade shop in my hometown on the bus line where women who may not normally feel comfortable talking to each other can go and feel like it's a safe place to ask stupid questions. A place where negativity is discouraged by all.  I have a lot of stuff to write but I don't have patients to use my hand and a pen or a keyboard. It's usually easiest if I can just dictate my concerns.

A couple things to ponder:  Today's world is a figament of one person's perception\/imagination.  Communal models---otherwise known as Intentional Communities still exist and are quite functional.  Check out Damanhur in Europe and Yogaville in Virginia.  Some soul contracts demand that money and energy exchange be handled very carefully.  Egoic behavior is the human obstacle course.  Spiritual education always preceeds the material (Illusion called Maya) world.  So...perhaps...those spiritual workers have a bigger calling than how the world currently views and uses money (mammon).  I whole heartedly believe in \"getting out there\" and finding the correct path of prosperity and wealth thinking and action.  I just think there some big things that impede people from making it all happen the way our conscious mind wants it to.  Some people---especially wounded healers---need healing (all the way to the soul level if necessary) before stepping too far into the arena as a career.  There are countless drawbacks that prevent a lot of career expansions.

Not because my beliefs are totally different now, but because God is teaching me a new language. It is like a divine revelation of how things ALL flow together. My dialect and language may not sound \"correct\" to them. This is what I think I have feared. Soooo.... I have been trying to find loop holes. I have been teaching, writing, supporting, coaching, etc. but it is not been to the fullest like I believe I am chosen to do. \nThank you for the article Joanne. It was confirmation on a lot of levels. Even the part about accepting money for my services. :-) "},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"moonfairy"},"datePublished":"2012-10-14T12:13:19-07:00","text":"My brother was just told that he is a light worker.

Joanne your encouraging words really impacted my life, I really didn't know which way I should go on my spiritual journey. My life has changed, now I don't want anything of the world, for dear life all I want to do is the will and works of the higher Spirit of the Universe. Joanne this world need people to stand up and spread life into every living soul. I'm a strong voice for God, I must stand and shine light on every dark place. I don't know my next move, God saved my life and now I live for him. I heard God 1\/14\/2011 after that I. Left everything, no more bondage, pain GONE! I quit my miserable 08\/30\/2011 finally after many years of strongholds. I'm free God said to me last year, today I still follow him, my life has never been the same, I ran out of myself, now I see.

Everything after that, the Spirit continues to speak especially while when my stomach is empty, fasting. He speaks heavy, He knows I want it BAD. Its beautiful, its a place I've neven been before, its beautiful. However I'm safe there, im at peace there, also in the spirit and in truth the Spirit opens the word to me, i cannot explain it, its so amazing. Now when i read the bible reading in the spirit, the words are not in the carnal anymore. Its no longer mysteries nor parables, Gods word unvealed. This taste God shared with me i crave for daily, i want more. I just cant get enough, when i got to church and sunday school, my Paster's sermons are past behind, thats Gods very own words. I cannot lie, is there anyone out there hungry like me. No one wants to be fed NEW FRUIT"},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jean Bakula"},"datePublished":"2012-03-31T21:43:02-07:00","text":"This is good advice. I write on 3 sites, and on HP mostly to teach others to do Astrology on their own. I've been deluged with people wanting answers to problems. I do charts the old way, but just ordered software. My issue is that people ask questions on here and other sies which waste my time for hours. When they find they must pay, I never hear from them. To hand calculate it took me 7 hrs. on one I did last week, for $25. I'm taking a break to get used to the program I ordered, and have to write realistic rules for people who want my services. I think exchaning money is fine, but it isn't a license for the person to ask you personal questions about their lives forever and expect answers. I have actually gotten stuff like, \"Sun in Pisces, Capricorn moon, what can you tell me?\" Today I got a women who gave me no info, except she is 50, her life is falling apart, what should she do? I'm not a full blown psychic, and although sympathetic, think that's just rude. I had an Indian man who assured me if I read 2 YEARS of stuff for him, he would recommend me to all his friends. Great, hours of free work and many more like him. I've written over 50 metaphysical hubs on here, and if they read many of them they could answer their own questions. Sorry to vent. I think tarot readings online or by phone are BS, there is no way to get the person's vibrations in the cards by shuffling. It's hard to separate the spiritual seekers from people who want something for nothing. They don't even want to do enough inner work to describe their problems. I've written What Astrology Can't Tell You and Fake Spirituality, I'm coming out of a few negative weeks. Maybe when Mercury goes direct this will change. Thanks for the hub!!"},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"klarawieck"},"datePublished":"2012-03-14T22:04:51-07:00","text":"Joanne, this is a great article, very insightful and informative. I am a medium by birth, but I've come to realize that it's not meant to be my source of income in this life. The only times I get to say what I see is when I'm handed the information, and it usually happens when least expected - while waiting in line at the supermarket, etc. If I try to do a reading on someone, unless that person has a vibration that is compatible with mine, I go completely blank! I'm sure that it's something that can be developed with a lot of practice, but I will continue using it as a form to communicate with my loved ones, and spirit guides, and to deliver a message whenever it's given to me to do so. \r\nI enjoyed your writing very much.
