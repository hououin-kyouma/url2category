"description":"This episode is about listening to your intuition and getting clear about what you want from a relationship. Todays caller, Sandra, realizes she may want to continue her current relationship due to familiarity or comfort and not because it is truly what she wants from a relationship.\n\n\n\nBe mindful of what you are scared of and what you are making your number one fear. Sandras fear of losing herself should have been the fear she is paying attention to.\n\nWhat legitimate fears should you pay more attention to? For example, the fear of losing someone you may be doubting the relationship with or the fear of spending additional years in an unsatisfying relationship? The fear of leaving your job and having less money for a while and dealing with uncertainty or the fear of spending the rest of your life in a career you hate?\n\nFear can serve us in some way. It can light a fire in us to make necessary changes and when we take action we dont need the fear. But if you are tapped into the wrong fear you start doubting yourself.\n\nSandras soul wants to know who she is, independent of who she is in a relationship. Will she make the choice that serves the highest good?\n\nIf you want to learn to bring your unconscious to your conscious mind so you can remove obstacles from your life join me for my free No Regrets Master Class.

"description":"This episode is about suppressing feelings and being comfortable in our own skin. Todays caller, Becca, could have been a millennial who was accustomed to instant gratification and unrealistic expectations when it came to working. But, it wasnt what she struggles with at all. I didnt stereotype her or jump to conclusions, instead, I asked her what the most challenging thing in her life was.\n\n\n\nIts hard to get yourself motivated and inspired when there is no feeling associated with what you are doing. Often, we think something external is the problem but there is no external without the internal. When we dont know how to process our feelings, we numb the pain and keep upping the numbing technique. Its important to learn how to process our Expectation Hangovers, our old hurts, our old pains.\n\nWhen a pattern of discomfort has become too comfortable we may just want to change our lives, but like in Beccas case, this can lead to extreme behavior. And, if you are holding on to shame, release it. Get it out into the light. Shame comes with blame. Its time to forgive yourself and to forgive the other person because holding on to anger and resentment is only hurting you.\n\nIf you are looking for support, encouragement, and love, my Personal Mastery Course, Over It and On With It is the most comprehensive virtual coaching program I have. You receive six weeks of personalized coaching with me, guided meditations, videos, and I engage with you live on Facebook Lives and in group coaching calls. This course starts in October and its only offered once per year.\n\nConsider/Ask Yourself:\n\tWould you consider yourself a bit of an extremist?\n\nBeccas Question:\nBecca feels something is holding her back from being committed to her work.\n\nBeccas Key Insights and Ahas:\n\tShe is mimicking the patterns of her dad.\n\tShe distracted herself with drugs and alcohol to deal with her parents divorce.\n\tShes looking for quick fix.\n\tShe feels ashamed of contracting an STD.\n\tShe thinks of leaving her job when she needs a quick fix for a problem.\n\nHow to Get Over It and On With It:\n\tShe should forgive herself for distracting herself with partying.\n\tShe should bring her best to the job she is in now.\n\tShe can take responsibility for her choices without blaming herself.\n\tShe can do the exercises in Expectation Hangover.\n\nTakeaways:\n\tIf you are bored in your job or relationship examine if you have difficulty being present.\n\tLook at how some of your worst fears are already happening. Consider what you are going to do to change it.\n\tBring your shame out of the shadows. Forgive yourself and forgive others.\n\tIf you are bored in your work, or life, write a letter about everything that is wonderful about your situation. How can you bring more excitement from the inside out?\n\nSponsor:\nTrue Car  Are you looking for a new car?

"description":"This episode is about abundance, prosperity, and how to overcome blocks to getting your financial life to where it feels healthy. I coach todays caller, Doreen, on breaking some limiting beliefs around money and shifting her spending and earning patterns.\n\n\n\nAs children, when we see our parents struggle we often make a vow or promise to ourselves that we will never end up in the same situation. We need to recognize that we manifested the intention, then explore the lessons from it. Then, shift to the next level of putting new beliefs and behaviors into place. Change your orientation from self-improvement to self-upgrades or up-leveling.\n\nIf you are a coach its important to stretch your clients but not until they snap. Be sensitive to where they are and give them a step that is reasonable and realistic, like I did with Doreen around energetically releasing her mother from her care.\n\nConsider/Ask Yourself:\n\tDo you feel you have blocks or issues when it comes to money?\n\tDo you have a lot of debt?\n\tDo you quickly spend what you have and sabotage your financial success?\n\tIs it hard for you to ask for what you are worth and is it hard to receive?\n\tDo you feel guilty when you have money?\n\tDo you believe it is possible to shift your relationship with money?\n\nDoreens Question:\nDoreen would like to manifest financial abundance into her life.\n\nDoreens Key Insights and Ahas:\n\tShe may be following in her parents financial footsteps.\n\tShe wants to be taken care of.\n\tShe doesnt want to be like her mother.\n\tShe feels guilty that she is doing better than her mother.\n\nHow to Get Over It and On With It:\n\tShe needs to parent herself about where true safety comes from.\n\tShe should write a letter to her mother she doesnt intend to send, about her relationship to money.\n\tShe should make a list of her new belief system about earning, money, and what she wants to create.\n\tShe should stop parenting her mother.\n\tShe should focus on herself and stop playing small.\n\nTakeaways:\n\tConsider if there were any vows you made to yourself as a child such as I will never be like that and look at what it is creating in your life. Do those vows need to be re-negotiated?\n\tIf theres someone you need to break energetic ties to, write them a letter you never mail, stating what you are no longer taking on.\n\tIf you want to up your financial IQ I recommend you read The Abundance Book, The Science of Getting Rich and Money: A Love Story.\n\nSponsor:\nStitch Fix  Shop in a productive way and end up with purchases you actually love, right from home.

"description":"This episode is about taking responsibility for the part you play in relationships and realizing you did nothing wrong. Todays caller, Mary, is having a challenging time letting go of an ex. She is obsessing over his new relationship and cant seem to get over it, even in therapy. During the call, Mary makes a major shift.\n\nMary is critical of herself and hard on herself for the choices she makes. Her unprocessed anger, sadness, and lack of fulfillment in her own life were leaking out onto her partner.\n\nThe more unsettled and unhappy we are in our own life the more we tend to be irritable, snappy, impatient, or mean  often to the people we love the most. I recently wrote a blog, #1 Tool to Avoiding Conflict in any Relationship to address this.\n\nAs women, It is important for us to know when we are in our masculine and how it throws off the polarity in a relationship. I highly recommend the work of Alison Armstrong and David Deida can be useful resources for understanding how polarity works in any type of relationship.\n\nAlso, when we obsess about others we avoid looking at ourselves. We can not fixate or attempt to understand someone else without understanding ourselves first. Even if we werent 100% our best selves, we need to bring the focus back to ourselves and look for the lessons.\n\nWhat is your Expectation Hangover teaching you?\n\nI will be in Indonesia, Bali, and Malaysia at the end of September. I have Coaching sessions available for those time zones. If you are interested in being put on the waitlist to be on the air with me, email Assist@ChristineHassler.com and make the subject Alt time zone coaching session.\n\nAre you frustrated and worried about your finances? Do you feel like you have enough money to live the life you deserve? Brittney Castro of Financially Wise Women can help you to feel mature with your money and eliminate fear around your finances with her free money training class. Watching it will help you bust through the 3 things that are holding you back from getting your finances under control.\n\nConsider/Ask Yourself:\n\tIs there something from your past you are having a hard time letting go? \n\tAre you obsessing about a person so much that it is taking up your mental energy and preventing you from moving forward?\n\tCan you admit you havent always shown up as your best self in a relationship?\n\tAre you willing to take 100% responsibility for your life?\n\nMarys Question:\nMary would like to know how to accept her breakup and get over her ex.\n\nMarys Key Insights and Ahas:\n\tShe has been seeing a therapist.\n\tShe has been cheated on in past relationships.\n\tHer father was emotionally unavailable.\n\tShe would fight with her ex.\n\tFixating on her ex is distracting from learning a lesson.\n\tShe may believe the relationship ending is her fault.\n\tShe doesnt want to have to take action to get him back.\n\nHow to Get Over It and On With It:\n\tShe should take responsibility for 100% of her 50% of the breakup and realize she didnt do anything wrong.\n\tShe should take three months to focus and no contact with her ex.\n\tShe should envision forward.\n\nTakeaways:\n\tTake responsibility, even when you want to feel like a victim, and own your end of something that didnt turn out like you planned?\n\tForgive yourself. Beating yourself up will not help you learn, grow, or heal any faster.\n\tIs there someone in your life you need a break from?\n\tAlways look for the lessons.

"description":"This episode is about a romantic relationship, specifically the end of a romantic relationship. Todays caller, Jobe, cant seem to get over his ex-girlfriend. My coaching went in a direction that surprised us both as it seemed Jobe needed closure in more than one relationship.\n\nThere were three main areas I coached Jobe in so he could move on.\n\nOne, Jobe had a lack of self-love. He sourced his love from his ex. Its hard to get over someone when they are our source of love  because we need love. We go through withdrawal because love can be an addiction.\n\nThe second thing that makes it hard to move on is wearing rose-colored glasses when looking at the relationship in the rear view mirror. Jobes relationship was an issue-based relationship. There was a lot of chemistry but it wasnt healthy.\n\nAnd, I sensed a lack of forgiveness in Jobe. We move on when we forgive.  Forgiving isnt condoning a behavior, forgiving is about letting go of judgment, resentment, regret, and anger, so you can be free.\n\nWe have a hard time moving on from a relationship when there is a lingering issue that needs completion. Often our consciousness doesnt let something go when we need to go back and clean something up.\n\nOn October 11th, I will be teaching a free master class to share information about my Personal Mastery Course, Over It and On With It.

"description":"This episode is about motivating a millennial out of their comfort zone. Todays caller, Jane, is a mother of a 28-year-old daughter who is still living at home. We dive into how Janes needing to be needed can impact relationships in a not-so-positive way.\n\n\nThe millennial generation was the most over-parented generation. The parenting advice at the time was to be your childs friend and that everyone is a winner. It has created a failure to launch, because the children never learned to make their own decisions. As a result, they may not do well when faced with challenges or uncertainty.\n\nA lot of 20-Somethings blame their being dependent on the economy or the job market, but its more about a comfort zone. But, what is comfortable is not always what is healthy. 20-Somethings who are still financially or emotionally dependent on their parents are experiencing adult-a-lescence.\n\nAdulthood is about being emotionally responsible for yourself, making your own decisions and falling on your face a few times, struggling a bit and paying your dues.\n\nIf you are a 20-Something who is still living at home its time to cut the umbilical cord. You are delaying and avoiding becoming an adult. Stop being afraid to struggle, suffer or fail.\n\nIf you are a parent you need to cut the cord. You are enabling your child if you allow them to rely on you, financially or emotionally. You may be setting them up for a lifetime of not learning how to truly trust and depend on themselves.\n\nIf you are looking for support, encouragement and love, my Personal Mastery Course, Over It and On With It is the most comprehensive virtual coaching program I have. You receive 6-weeks of personalized coaching with me, guided meditations, videos, and I engage with you live on Facebook Lives and in group coaching calls. This course starts in October, and its only offered once per year.\n\nWe are proud to be part of the PodcastOne Network. Take the PodcastOne Survey and tell us how you feel about your favorite shows.\n\nConsider/Ask Yourself:\n\tAre you a parent whose adult child is still living at home, and you like it?\n\tAre you a millennial who is still living at home?\n\tDoes being needed make you feel good?\n\tIs there someone you think you are helping but may actually be enabling them by not giving them a chance to take care of themselves and to not learn their own lessons?\n\nJanes Question:\nJane would like to know how to motivate her 28-year-old daughter to get out of the house. \n\nJanes Key Insights and Ahas:\n\tHer daughter doesnt have any friends. \n\tShe has played a role in her daughters failure to launch. \n\tShe may be perpetuating her daughters belief that she is unstable.\n\tShe wants to fix all of her childrens problems.\n\tShe doesnt want to see her children suffer.\n\tShe is enabling her daughter to be complacent.\n\nHow to Get Over It and On With It:\n\tShe should read 20-Something Manifesto.\n\tShe should speak with her daughter the health of their relationship and create a plan to help her to be on her own.\n\tShe should stop giving her daughter so much advice.\n\tShe should find something that makes her feel purposeful.\n\tShe needs to shift her focus from her daughter to herself.\n\tShe should realize she did the best she could.\n\nTakeaways:\n\tIf you are a millennial living at home or have a millennial living home, create a launch plan.\n\tWork through the exercises in 20-Something Manifesto.\n\tLook at where you may need to be needed and let go of it. It may be reinforcing co-dependent behaviors and patterns.\n\tLook at how you may be enabling people by over-caretaking and rescuing them.

"description":"This episode is about making self-serving decisions. Todays caller, Renae, is married, and questioning whether or not her marriage has reached its expiration date. As you can hear in the call, Renea intuitively knows what she should do but she needs to be empowered so she can take action.\n\nDo all relationships where one person is on the growth path, and the other person isnt, have an expiration date? Not necessarily. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to know when its time to leave a relationship. When there is abuse, addiction, or toxic behavior, or the other person is unwilling to invest in the relationship, you have to be honest about why you are still in this type of relationship, and whether it is really serving your highest good.\n\nWhen it is time to evaluate a relationship, or when its time to end it, be honest with yourself and listen to your intuition. You may already know the answer. When we seek counsel with others, we want to hear from someone else what we may already know. Sometimes we are looking for someone to give us permission.\n\nIf you are a parent who feels they may have messed up their kids, your fear is not helping you or them. What does help is to help them learn how to make self-honoring decisions. You should start equipping them with the personal development tools and mindset to help them break generational patterns, and to not personalize the situation. Children shouldnt feel that anything was their fault.\n\nAnd, actions speak louder than words. We must give someone the dignity of the process but honor our own boundaries. Dont be a victim. Consider Al-Anon, and find other people you can connect to. Dont bond over wounds, but find other people who understand your background. It will help empower you.\n\nIf you are looking for support, encouragement and love, my Personal Mastery Course, Over It and On With It is the most comprehensive virtual coaching program I have. You receive 6-weeks of personalized coaching with me, guided meditations, videos, and I engage with you on Facebook Lives and in group coaching calls. This course is starting in October, and its only offered once per year.\n\nConsider/Ask Yourself:\n\tAre you questioning your current relationship? Are you in, or did you grow up in, an abusive environment?\n\tDo you know what to do, but wish someone would give you permission to do it? Have you been attempting to change someone else, but realize the most important person to focus on right now is yourself?\n\nRenaes Question:\nRenae wants to know if she should stay in her current long-term relationship.\n\nRenaes Key Insights and Ahas:\n\tShe grew up in an environment of physical and verbal abuse.\n\tHer husband is verbally abusive to her and her children.\n\tShe doesnt focus on herself.\n\tHer 15-year-old daughter wants her to get a divorce.\n\tShes afraid to make the wrong decision.\n\tShe recognizes she needs to change her life and to give her kids a different environment.\n\tShes known what to do, but needed validation to move forward.\n\nHow to Get Over It and On With It:\n\tShe needs to make a decision to break patterns and to change things.\n\tShe needs to start documenting abuse.\n\tShe needs to stop beating herself up, and practice self-love and self-care.\n\tShe needs to believe in herself, and give herself positive encouragement.\n\nTakeaways:\n\tIf you are questioning your relationship, ask yourself, What is this relationship teaching me? What patterns do I need to complete? Could it be time to go? What do I need to do to make a shift?\n\tIf you are a parent, and feel that your children have seen things in your life or marriage that have been tough and they are struggling, get them help! You cant be their therapist, counselor, or coach. They may need an objective person they can talk to, and to give them new tools.\n\tMy Inner Circle community can be a great place to find the love and support from people who know what you are", "title":"EP 102: How to Know if its Time to Leave a Relationship with Renae", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script>

Listen in as we break down how very important gut health is and take the shame off any digestive issues!!  We discuss the causes and cures of SIBO, IBS and how our gut impacts so many aspects of our life.\n \nAllison Siebecker, ND, MSOM, LAc, has worked in the nutritional field since 1988 and is a 2005 graduate of The National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM), where she earned her Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine and her Masters in Oriental Medicine.

"description":"This episode is about taking action when faced with fear and anxiety. I coach todays caller, Suzanne, through her pattern of catastrophic thinking, worry, and anxiety, to allow her to respond differently to her fear-based thoughts. If you can relate to feeling like fear and anxiety stops you, or if you are a bit of a worrywart, you will receive a lot of value out of this coaching session.\n\nWorry is using our mind to come up with and visualize worst case scenarios, instead of using the power of our mind to visualize what we truly want to occur.\nOn some level, we think its protecting us or keeping us safe. But all its doing is creating more anxiety.\n\nWhen we feel fear, its important that we first be with the part of us that feels scared and anxious. When we get scared as adults, we need to learn how to respond to it in a way that feels reassuring. A big part of this can be addressed by self-soothing. Most of the ways we attempt to soothe ourselves are not about soothing at all. We may be numbing or distracting ourselves. We run away from the fear by working, eating, sedating ourselves with drugs or alcohol, or using social media for hours.\n\nBut the more we ignore it, the bigger the monster becomes, so instead of running from your fear, face it head on. It doesnt mean you have to conquer it, just be with it. What does it need from you? If the fear has a message for you, whats the message? Can you trust yourself to sit with it rather than run? Tell yourself you are safe, and that everything is OK. Be a reassuring voice to yourself.\n\nAs you will hear in the call, Suzannes sense of self, and ability to feel safe regardless of external conditions, wasnt developed, so she didnt feel safe when she was outside of her home.\n\nLike many of us, Suzanne said she understood my coaching intellectually but she still found it hard to shift in the moment. But, its the follow-through that matters.\n\nThats why I designed my Inner Circle membership community to focus on a certain quality every month. We focus on moving something from awareness into integration. So change actually happens. Its more than learning concepts, you learn to integrate what you are learning into your life.\n\nMy podcast is now part of the Podcast One Network.

A couple shows you may want to check out are my interview with Brandi Glanville on Unfiltered, and Mentoring Moments, a place to get mentoring from women you may never meet.\n\nConsider/Ask Yourself:\n\tDo you worry a lot? Do you have a tendency to imagine worst-case scenarios, or have a habit of waiting for the other shoe to drop?\n\tDo you think that preparing for the worst protects you from being disappointed?\n\tDid something challenging, traumatic or catastrophic happen to you as a kid, so you live with nervous anticipation that something bad will happen again?\n\tHow are you soothing yourself when you go into fear, anxiety, or panic? Are you able to calm yourself down? What are your coping mechanisms?\n\nSuzannes Question:\nSuzanne wants to know how to take action when she feels crippled by anxiety.\n\nSuzannes Key Insights and Ahas:\n\tShe is a catastrophic thinker.\n\tShe doesnt deal with losses well.\n\tShe didnt feel emotionally safe as a child.\n\tShe had an eating disorder in college.\n\tShe surrounds herself with mentally stable people.\n\tShe tries to put her emotional health first.\n\tShe practices negative self-talk.\n\tShe seeks reassurance from outside herself.\n\tShe lets her mind run the show.\n\nHow to Get Over It and On With It:\n\tShe should find a new way to relate to herself to get a consistent experience.\n\tShe needs to acknowledge when she is in the midst of catastrophic thinking, and practice self-soothing techniques.\n\tShe should do the Release Writing exe", "title":"EP 101: How Do I Take Action When I Have Anxiety and Fear?

I am actually relieved with this diagnosis because it has really brought my awareness about GUT HEALTH to the surface. \n\nIn this episode I share about my journey, the symptoms that led me to get tested (and ironically I was not really having stomach/digestion based issues), and the healing opportunity this has presented.  \n\nI also talk with Gut Health Expert Dr. Sayed A. Shah, MD. His personal journey with Integrative Medicine started when his son was diagnosed with Autism. By using Integrative Medicine practices, they have been able to overcome many of the challenges his son has faced.

"description":"This episode is about making self-serving decisions. I coach todays caller, Michelle, through a decision about her long-term relationship. As you can hear in the call, Michelle intuitively knows what she should do, but she needs to be empowered so she can take action.\n\nPeople feel most confident to make a decision or choice when they feel empowered. We feel most empowered when we arrive at our own answers. During the session, I reflected back to Michelle, and I asked her a lot of questions so she could get to her own answers.\n\nMichelle was invested in saving her husband, but was it more about him or her? Her intentions were pure, but she was outsourcing her self-worth by trying to save him. There was a limiting belief that if she saves or heals him it gives her value.\n\nIts important to unhook yourself from the role of caretaker or savior. Go back and listen to my after-the-call breakdown of Episode #97 with Trinette for my explanation of what codependency is.\n\nAll of us struggle, at one point, with a breakup, a challenging relationship, or lack of a relationship. Our struggles are often a catalyst to dive into personal growth work. We all want love and we all desire healthy, fulfilling relationships.\n\nThis is why I designed a special course, Get Over Your Breakup & On with Love.

"description":"This episode is about being your authentic self and speaking your truth. I coach todays caller, Judy, through her feelings of isolation, and empower her to have an honest conversation with her husband, and herself, about her needs.\n\nLoneliness is an epidemic, especially in this day and age when so many of us live alone. We are not close to our family geographically, or we dont have a soul family or community to be a part of. We need a healing connection. We need to feel part of something, part of a tribe. We need to feel connected to ourselves. What often perpetuates a feeling of loneliness is a disconnection to ourselves that comes from judging ourselves and being hard on ourselves. If you suffer from loneliness or a lack of self-esteem you are not alone. Let the fact that you are not alone motivate you to gain confidence and to connect with a community.\n\nSpeaking your truth is when you say whats true for you, and you are able to communicate your needs. When are you not speaking your truth?\n\nMany of us think people pleasing is a way to get love and find validation. We think if people see the real us, they may not like us. The more you show the real you, and the more authentic you are, your relationship with yourself will improve, your self-esteem will improve, and the intimacy and connection you have with other people will also improve.\n\nIts great to make other people happy but its more important to please ourselves first, by making self-honoring choices. People pleasing could be the reason you are feeling isolated. On some level, people pleasing is draining.\n\nDrop the people pleasing, up your self-esteem by making self-honoring choices and get out there and find your tribe!\n\nConsider/Ask Yourself:\n\tDo you feel isolated? Are you craving more connection?\n\tAre you in a marriage or relationship where you feel isolated? Do you feel like you are dependent on your partner or you are living according to their dreams and desires more than your own?\n\tAre you a people pleaser? Do you have a hard time making your needs a priority?\n\tDo you find it challenging to speak your truth?\n\nJudys Question:\nJudy wants to know how to find herself and how to raise her self-esteem.\n\nJudys Key Insights and Ahas:\n\tShe has been continuously moving for a year.\n\tHer husband tries to support her but he doesnt really get it.\n\tHer husband has a stronger personality than she does.\n\tShes dependent on her husband and doesnt go places on her own.\n\tShe always puts other people first.\n\tShe has a hard time saying no.\n\tShe takes care of people, hoping it will help to build intimacy.\n\nHow to Get Over It and On With It:\n\tShe should be honest and vulnerable with her husband about her feelings.\n\tShe should speak up when she feels she wants to say something.\n\tShe should lean more into authenticity and less into people pleasing.\n\tShe should spend some time on her own engaging with other people.\n\nTakeaways:\n\tIf you are in a relationship with the opposite sex, and would like to improve your masculine/feminine communication dynamics, consider studying the subject more.\n\tIf you are feeling isolated, start with a goal of talking to five new people every day, and then build on that number. Start getting yourself out there and finding your tribe.\n\tSpeak your truth authentically. If you have trouble doing it, join the Inner Circle community.

"description":"This episode is about moving past your fears and getting over it and on with it. I coach todays caller, Lindsey, on how to move from awareness to implementation. She knows the next steps to take but cannot figure out why she isnt taking them. She thinks her problem is about time management, productivity, and balance but, as you will hear in the call, its not about that at all.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think about failure? Imagine you fail, or you get a no, or your endeavor is a complete flop. What happens inside of you? What do you think and feel? Are you embarrassed?\n\nA healthy relationship to failure is an essential ingredient to success. Failure is defined as lack of success. But defining success is more difficult because if success is learning something, growing, or having experiences that make us stronger and wiser, then we never really fail. In my opinion, the only way you fail is if you go into the hopeless, helpless victim mode.\n\nStop playing it safe just because you want to avoid failure. Get out of your comfort zone, and jump in the pool instead of taking teeny, tiny baby steps so you can move forward.\n\nYou have to drop the guilt and give yourself permission to do what you want.\n\nSign up for the Summer of Love Challenge.

"description":"This episode is about going back to a relationship even when you know its not what you want. Todays caller, Trinette, is in a volatile relationship, but we uncover that its not about him but what he triggers in her.\n\n\n\nDo these issues always go back to our parents? Not always. However, our formative years were when our mind programmed the belief systems that govern our current choices. Its when most of our core wounds occurred because we didnt have the tools or support to process them in a healthy way.\n\nI dont like to put labels on things, but I used the term codependent with Trinette to help her understand and relate. Codependency, when boiled down, is really a lack of a healthy sense of self. Codependent people get their self-worth from the approval of others or by taking on others as projects. They can also be people pleasers.\n\nIt is possible to heal codependency. Recognizing you are codependent means you are ready and willing to commit to having a healthy sense of self. The first step is to get out of the codependent relationship.\n\nA healthy sense of self means we recognize that we are whole, lovable, and complete, and dont need anyone. Relationships can be an expression of love and connection, rather than an attempt to fill the void.\n\nTo my Aussie Friends  My annual trip to Australia is slated for the first 2 weeks of October 2017. I will make time for private intensives and possibly a personal growth retreat or mastermind for wellness entrepreneurs. Email Jill@ChristineHassler.com and let me know what you would like me to create while I am there.\n\nAlso,  I am launching a relationship course called Get Over Your BreakUp and On With Love. Its about healing your old issues and creating the love you want. The 1st 10 people who email Jill@ChristineHassler.com and tell her you want to be in the course will receive a 10% discount.\n\nConsider/Ask Yourself:\n\tAre you in an on again-off again relationship? Do you keep going back for more, even though its really not what you want?\n\tCan you relate to not feeling unconditional love when you were growing up?\n\tDo you experience anxiety or sadness when you are not in a relationship? Do you settle for unhealthy relationships?\n\tWhen it comes to self-love and self-trust, can you admit you have room to grow?\n\nTrinettes Question:\nTrinette would like to know why there is so much back-and-forth in her relationship.\n\nTrinettes Key Insights and Ahas:\n\tShes judgmental towards her boyfriend.\n\tSometimes her boyfriend gets physical.\n\tShe felt like her parents were immature.\n\tShe has a trust issue with love.\n\tThe relationship feels addictive to her.\n\tShe had to do many things on her own growing up.\n\tShe feels like she has been in survival mode her entire life.\n\nHow to Get Over It and On With It:\n\tShe should acknowledge herself for recognizing the issue.\n\tShe needs to stop going back for more.\n\tShe needs to give love to herself.\n\tShe should research co-dependency.\n\tShe needs to make a choice about her relationship.\n\tShe needs to let go of the fear that she is like her mother.\n\nTakeaways:\n\tIf you keep going in and out of a relationship you recognize as codependent, commit to choosing to get out of it.\n\tTry these resources on codependency  Melody Beatties Codependent No More,  Pia Mellodys Facing Codependence and Expectation Hangover.\n\tJoining my Inner Circle membership community will give you both the tools and the support you need.\n\tForgive the parents who set up your codependent patterns.

"description":"This episode is about shifting your external world while making internal changes. Todays caller, Jenn, has been through transformational changes, and believes she is confused about her work as a relationship coach. Anyone who is on the growth path will relate to this call in some way.\n\n\n\nAs we uncover and heal our issues, either in relationships or in the physical, we shift our vibration. Our energetic selves change, which creates a shift in what were attracted to and what we attract. Dis-ease and/or toxic relationships are heavy in energetic weight. As we heal, clear, and forgive, it shifts our vibration and it creates changes in our outside world. Some changes happen naturally and some just give us an unsettling feeling about something not being right.\n\nAs we shift consciousness our identity shifts, and as it does it can feel confusing, because our external life is not congruent with our internal life.\n\nJust because you dont have clarity about something, or something doesnt feel as fulfilling as it used to, doesnt mean you are confused. You are in a time of change and transformation. For something to transform, it must go through a period of chaos and uncertainty. Dont rush to figure it out  allow it to be revealed.\n\nTo my Aussie Friends  My annual trip to Australia is slated for the first 2 weeks of October, 2017. I will make time for private intensives and possibly a personal growth retreat or mastermind for wellness entrepreneurs. If you are interested email Jill@ChristineHassler.com ASAP!\n\nAnd as we are coming up on the 100th episode of this podcast, Over It and On With It has caught the attention of the PodcastOne network. It means exposure to a much larger audience, and access to advertisers who help pay production costs.  Yay! Im hoping this allows me to add more coaching episodes.\n\nConsider/Ask Yourself:\n\tIs there some aspect of your life that doesnt feel right, or just feels off?\n\tHave you healed a relationship or physical issue that has catalyzed wanting to make changes in other aspects of your life?\n\tCan you relate to being a chameleon to stay safe? Are you a people pleaser?\n\tAre you scared of being vulnerable or being seen?\n\nJenns Question:\nJenn feels she has lost her inspiration and passion towards her business. She wants to gain clarity around her coaching business.\n\nJenns Key Insights and Ahas:\n\tShe had a falling out with her mother.\n\tShe was physically ill.\n\tShe internalizes her mothers issues.\n\tShe was a people pleaser and chameleon around her mother.\n\tShe has always been there for others.\n\tHer relationship coaching feels shallow to her now.\n\tShes committed to getting out of her head.\n\nHow to Get Over It and On With It:\n\tShe should bring more of her own voice into her business.\n\tShe shouldnt underestimate the value she brings to her clients.\n\tFor guidance, she should look at the way the people she appreciates share their stories.\n\tShe should share her emotional depths.\n\nAction Steps:\n\tGet Expectation Hangover if you dont have it already, and in the spiritual section do the lesson quest exercise under the role of the seeker.\n\tTake an inventory of your external life. Does it match your internal life?\n\tHow can you be more vulnerable and honest? Think of the ways you are a people pleaser or play small.

"description":"This episode is about follow-through and commitment. Todays caller, Jill, has a pattern of giving up on everything she begins. She recently quit her job, but she fears she wont follow through with her new endeavor, based on her past patterns.\n\n\n\nDo you identify with starting things but not sticking to them? When your enthusiasm wears off, do you quit and then judge yourself?  Its a vicious cycle. Its important for you to get out of it.\n\nIf you have someone to blame, you are not going to change. Instead of hanging on to your scapegoats and excuses, shift your patterns by hanging on to your goals. Connect to your why and commit to your action steps, and stop quitting when things get hard.\n\nIf you feel you were over-parented, you cant blame your parents anymore. You need to set boundaries with them and parent yourself through your challenges. Allow yourself to be uncomfortable. Adversity is one of the ways we grow.\n\nCoaches:\n\n\tBefore giving clients insight or advice it is important to get into their model of the world. Ask them why they think they have the behavior.\n\n\tWhen a client is in their pattern when speaking to us, sometimes we miss it. As a coach, we should be more committed to their breakthrough than to solving their complaint.\n\nTodays caller Jill is part of my Inner Circle Membership Community.

My co-host Dr. Isaiah Pickens joins me on this weeks Coaches Corner to discuss our experience.\n\nConsider/Ask Yourself:\n\tCan you relate to a pattern of starting and stopping? How did your parents react when you experienced adversity? How is it affecting your level of commitment and being able to move through things?\n\tAre you putting too much on your plate?\n\tDo you have a story about giving up? Are you blaming a person or past situation for why you cant stick with things or be accountable for things in your life?\n\nJills Question:\nJill would like to know how to follow through with the projects she starts.\n\nJills Key Insights and Ahas:\n\tShe resents her mother for saying it was OK to quit.\n\tShe doesnt remember her parents giving her affection when she was a child.\n\tShe is giving away her power by resenting her mother.\n\tShe got love and attention when she gave up on things.\n\tShes not fluent in the experience of moving past resistance.\n\tShes not connected to her power.\n\nHow to Get Over It and On With It:\n\tShe should forgive her mother, and take responsibility for her own life.\n\tShe needs to connect with her inner coach and her own voice of encouragement.\n\tShe needs to learn to love herself through any resistance she encounters.\n\nAction Steps:\n\tStop blaming others. Take full responsibility for your life.\n\tBecome fluent in the voice of encouragement. Stop looking for reasons to quit or permission to stop.\n\tBreakdown overwhelm into small manageable steps.\n\tLook at your incomplete cycles of action. Set a date to complete something or let it go.

"description":"This episode is about moving into acceptance and forgiveness. Todays caller, Jen, is having a hard time getting to forgiveness because she doesn't believe her parents did the best they could. Her grudge may be costing her the very thing she longs for the most.\n\n\n\nOne of the ways we get to forgiveness is knowing people did the best they could, even if we believe they could have done better. Knowing they did the best they could with the tools they had is one of the ways we can get to forgiveness. It can be difficult, especially when it was a parent or a loved one.\n\nHolding on to anger, blame, and resentment is toxic. It will eat you up inside and keep you from what you want. Continuing to use the past as a scapegoat for why you dont have want you want gives your past power. Until you move into acceptance and forgiveness, your past will infiltrate every aspect of your present and your future.\n\nLook at the places where you are not letting love into your life. Are you focusing too much on the people that didnt love you in the way you wanted, and missing out on all the love around you?\n\nWould you like to connect more with me and receive a resource to help you transform into owning your purpose?

Write down all the things you wanted to hear from them and read it to yourself.\n\tDo projection work. Look at judgments you have towards others and see how you may be doing it in your own life, externally or internally.\n\tBe honest about the cost of holding onto a grudge and write down what it is keeping you from. Write down all the blessings you have in life and how you may be blinded to them because of the grudge.\n\tHave positive expectations and use your imagination to consider the best-case scenario.\n\nSponsor:\nONNIT: Get a 10% discount on your order by using this link.\n\nResources:\nChristine Hassler\nChristine Hassler Podcasts\nCoaches Corner with Gabby Bernstein  Turn Your Pain Into Purpose\nInner Circle Membership Community \n@ChristinHassler on Twitter\n@christinehassler on Instagram\nJill@ChristineHassler.com", "title":"EP 94: Forgiving the Seemingly Unforgivable with Jen", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script>

"description":"This episode is about disordered eating and yo-yo dieting. Today's caller, Alyssa, was diagnosed with an eating disorder when she was younger. She has been to therapy to help her understand abuse she endured as a child, but has not yet overcome the effect it had on her. For Alyssa to experience true healing and transformation she needs to make shifts on emotional, mental, behavioral and spiritual levels.  Many people have the experience of making progress only to see old patterns re-emerge. It can be discouraging and frustrating it can be to feel like you are backtracking, but you can get off the rollercoaster and experience growth without major setbacks. During my coaching session with Alyssa, I held a space of compassion for Alyssa without reinforcing her victim story. There were people who would pity her and people she could blame, but pity and blame are not going to stop her from binge eating. In fact, it would trigger the behavior. We can take our power back by making choices that create change. So, I created steps to help her feel empowered. A lot of people who were abused hold on to weight as a protective measure. because it's our body's response to the message from the mind of 'I want to hide. I want to be invisible.' If this resonates with you, listen to the podcast I did with Drew Manning,  \"Transforming Your Inner Critic into an Inner Coach\".  Joining my Inner Circle Membership Community is a great place to get support from a loving, high vibe, compassionate community. If you are someone who has dealt with body image issues or eating disorders, and have made it to the other side and would like to know how to turn your pain into your purpose, don't miss Gabby Bernstein's Free Training Videos. Plus, I will be announcing a very special bonus for those of you who enroll in Gabby's Master Class on June 23rd.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Do you struggle with gaining and losing weight? Perhaps so much so that you may have an eating disorder. ? Have you processed your issues and made progress in therapy regarding your past, but the old habits keep coming back? ? Do you sabotage your health and well-being? Is it hard for you to be disciplined and stick to a plan? ? Do you feel safe to be seen? Alyssa's Question: Alyssa would like to know how to move past her eating disorder for good. Alyssa's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She has always felt not good enough. ? She's forgiven people from her past. ? She didn't feel safe as a child. ? She feels she should be beyond her issue. How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She shouldn't identify with herself as a victim. ? She needs a behavioral shift to make her feel safe in her body. ? She needs to send love to a picture of her younger self. ? She needs to reframe the belief that she can trust people. ? She should ask God to help to make her feel safe and protected. Action Steps: ? If you have a re-emerging pattern like binge eating, what's the payoff? It's serving a purpose. Do some journaling as to what purpose it serves. ? If weight is something you struggle with move, into acceptance. Ask the weight what it needs. When you get the answer, create your own holistic treatment plan. Pick one thing on the behavioral, emotional, mental, and spiritual level you can commit to. Resources: Christine Hassler Christine Hassler Podcasts  My Favorite Summer Life Hacks!

"description":"This episode is about removing inner blocks and eliminating blind spots. Today's caller, Jon, is struggling with how his business is structured and the people he is hiring. He thought he was calling for some practical how-tos but the call went in a slightly different direction.  To shift our outer experience we must look inward first. So often we attempt to figure it out. We try to find solutions to our problems with our mind, and look for the actions to take to fix something. But in doing so we miss the incredible chance to look within and extract the learning opportunity from the situation. My coaching to Jon was about getting him out of his head and more into his heart. There was no issue with his accountability or drive; the block was more about how he was perceiving himself and his situation. Whenever you are presented with a challenge, or when things in your life feel off or aren't going the way you want, ask \"What is the message?\" and \"What am I learning?\" Answers become clear when we stop mentalizing everything so much. When we are attempting to figure things out on our own, it's more challenging to get a new insight. The spiritual definition of a miracle is a change in perception. My Inner Circle Membership Community is an easy way for you to find like-minded people and get more access to me and my coaching. Email Jill@ChristineHassler.com to ask about membership. And, don't miss my Coaches Corner episodes. There is new content every Saturday.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Is there a situation you can't seem to figure out? ? Are you an entrepreneur, business leader, or manager who would like to be better at making money and managing people? ? Do you think sales is a dirty word? If selling is part of your job, do you resist it? ? Do you have a clear vision of your why? Do you know why you do what you do, and do you feel passionate about it? Jon's Question: Jon is finding it difficult to find the right people for his business and would like to find a remedy. Jon's Key Insights and Ahas: ? He finds sales frustrating. ? Rejection is a pain point for him. ? He understands the fear of survival. ? He hasn't connected his freelancers to his why. ? He keeps himself protected from rejection. ? He will make his people feel like they are part of a team. How to Get Over It and On With It: ? He should focus more on his clients and enroll them into his why. ? He should find out why his freelancers want to work with him. ? He should consider how he has bridged gaps in the past. ? He should become less transactional and lean into connection. ? He should consider himself more of a leader and less of an executor. Action Steps: ? If you're stuck or challenged in any area of your life, how can you look at it from a different perspective? Stop trying to figure it out and be curious. Explore different ways of approaching it. ? What's your avoidance trap? Is it rejection? What do you spend so much time avoiding, that you are not focusing enough time on bringing in the things you want? ? If you are in sales, is there something you need to shift, in terms of your perception of it? Do you need to become more enrolling instead of just selling?

"description":"This episode is about being able to accept love.  Today's caller, Samantha is in a new loving relationship but has anxiety about it which is causing her to push her partner away. Ultimately, she fears she will sabotage the relationship.  When we lack self-love and acceptance we doubt our own lovability. When what we really want is coming to us we get scared and push it away, because we doubt our own lovability. When we doubt our own lovability it makes us do some sabotaging things when it comes to relationships. I gave Samantha some practical behavioral shifts, because awareness alone does not create change. If we think our past is part of who we are, we will never be truly free of it. We need to get the point where we realize the past is the past. It happened but it doesn't have to be who we are. Many times when we have a difficult experience in our past, we hold on to it because having it gets us pity, love, compassion, and attention from others. On an unconscious level, we hang on to it because we think it is how we can get compassion and be connected to people. When we hold on to our story too much, it gets us in a trap of consistently attempting to heal the past, rather than make the behavioral choices that create what we want in the present and for the future. Eventually, you have to drop the story. You'll notice I used a tough-love approach when coaching Samantha. To understand why I did it and the profound shifts that can occur because of it, check out my Coaches Corner — Tough Love and People who Have Helped Me in Profound Ways.  In last week's Coaches Corner, I interviewed my friend Amanda Steinberg, author of  Worth It. The episode is about embracing your relationship with money. And, don't miss this week's Coaches Corner with thought leader Danielle Laporte. Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Do you want love, especially in the form of a romantic relationship, but it scares you? ? Are you in a romantic relationship now, and engaging in sabotaging behavior? ? Have you talked about your past and your story, but things aren't shifting for you? Is the anxiety you feel about being in a relationship still there? ? Are you willing to get out of your comfort zone to break some patterns? Even if it's scary? Samantha's Question: Samantha would like to know how to be free of the fear and anxiety she is feeling in her new relationship. Samantha's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She's afraid of being hurt. ? She puts up a wall and shuts down when speaking with her new partner. ? She is trying to protect herself. ? She still identifies with her story. ? She is giving the people from her past too much power in her current life. How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She needs to go back and deal with her past. ? To move to the next phase she needs to change her behavior. ? She should do release writing when instead of zoning out. ? She needs to understand she is not alone. ? She needs to do the opposite of her current conditioned response.   Action Steps: ? Take a look at your old story about love; write it out. What are you still carrying around from your past, you keep playing out? Make a list of the things you think are protecting you. ? It's time to break patterns and shift your behaviors. You have to lean in and get a little uncomfortable, if you want change to happen. Sponsor: ONNIT: Get a 10% discount on your order by using this link.

"description":"This episode is about helping people instead of being a savior. Candace is a health practitioner suffering from work-related anxiety. She is wondering how to decrease the amount of anxiety that comes from feeling responsible for helping people, and she questions whether or not she is good enough to truly help them. We cover why we should not take on the responsibility of helping others, why it's important to be of service, and not a savior, and what is truly at the root of a desire to help or save others.  I asked Candace why she worked in a health and service position. She said it makes her feel she has a purpose. Having a purpose is wonderful, but when your purpose is tied to core issues from your past — you are attempting to heal through your work — you will perpetuate an unhealthy attachment to your work, and you may suffer from anxiety or not-enoughness. Her unresolved hurts around her emotionally unavailable parents are creating a huge attachment to her work, and anytime we have huge attachment, we feel a huge burden of responsibility, which creates self-doubt, because we are taking on way too much responsibility. We become saviors instead of truly being of service. It's not our responsibility to make sure people change, and it is not our responsibility to make sure they don't suffer. I know it hurts to watch other people suffering, but we can not take away other people's pain. By holding a space for the suffering, instead of taking it on, we can truly help by way of compassion. The more comfortable we get with our own suffering, the more we can hold a space of love and compassion for others. If we take on the belief that it is our responsibility to fix someone, then we assume they are broken, and not equipped to heal themselves. One of the biggest gifts we can give to others is to see them as whole, and having all the inner resources they need. People save themselves. Sign up for my weekly blog and vlog. Last week I posted,  How to Make and Nurture Friendships. Friendship is a key ingredient to your well-being so, don't neglect it Also, subscribe to Christine Hassler on Youtube. Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Do you enjoy helping people? Do you find yourself overinvested in making sure they change or heal? ? Does your sense of worthiness or value come from being needed by others or helping others? ? If you are in a helping profession, do you ever feel like a fraud, or like you don't have what it takes to truly help? ? Do you suffer from anxiety at work, or do you ever feel depleted or drained after being with someone who is struggling or suffering? Candace's Question: Candace wants to free herself from the anxiety she feels from her alternative health work. Candace's Key Insights and Ahas: ? Helping people gives her purpose. ? She had to beg for attention as a child. ? She is trying to give others the attention she didn't get as a child. ? She feels emotionally drained at the end of the day. ? She is continuing to do to herself what her parents did to her. ? She has anger towards her father. How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should recognize it is not her responsibility for her patients to get better or for her to fix them. ? She should stop projecting her fears onto the people, and give them the dignity of their process. ? She should make a list of her new beliefs about her clients. ? She should make a list of self-care practices she will start, stop, and modify. ? Use Expectation Hangover to work through forgiving her parents. Action Steps:   ? Give your younger self the attention and love he or she needs. ? Move into forgiveness of anyone from your past who is reinforcing a negative pattern of taking on responsibility. ?

"description":"This episode is about reassurance. Laura is a people pleaser. She goes above and beyond for people and doesn't get it back in return. She then feels disappointed. I work with her on understanding why she people pleases, why it's selfish to be a people pleaser, and how to shift out of the pattern.  You may have heard me say this many times before, but people pleasing is selfish. It's really all about you. You are the one who doesn't want to upset people, you want to avoid confrontation, and you are the one who is worried about how people perceive you. Laura knows how to be loving and giving; she just needs to direct it towards herself. Use this call as a catalyst to look at your own patterns without judgment, and without beating yourself up. The key to personal development is to work on yourself, without thinking anything is wrong with you. No one outside of you can give you the acceptance and love you need. And, to shift out of a pattern, we have to let go of things from our past. We have to come to peace with the fact that some people in our lives are never going to change. Many people don't have the tools to change, or they don't want to change. The older they get, the more their patterns are reinforced. If you feel like the black sheep of the family, or you don't fit it, it's ok. You may be the change maker and the lightworker. You may be the one who is willing to break generational patterns. You can love and accept your biological family but find your soul family. As Gandhi said, be the change you wish to see in the world. Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Do you relate to being a people pleaser? ? Can you acknowledge yourself for your accomplishments, but struggle acknowledging yourself for just who you are? ? Do you feel like the black sheep of your family, and sometimes you are afraid to be who you are because you might lose your family's approval? Laura's Question: Laura feels she goes above and beyond for people, and they don't return the effort. She wants to know how to break the pattern of being a people pleaser. Laura's Key Insights and Ahas: ? People don't put as much effort into her as she does for them. ? She continues to look for the love and acceptance she wanted from her mother and father in other people. ? She is looking for attention and validation. ? She feels genuine in her job as a social worker. ? Her father never told her he loved her, and she resents him for it. ? She blames herself for what happened to her as a child. ? She is ready to break past patterns. ? She is the lightworker in her family. How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should accept her parents didn't give her the love and acceptance she wanted, and give herself the love, acceptance, and validation she didn't get when she was little. ? Everything she wants people to say to her, she should say to herself. ? She should accept her position as the lightworker in her family. Takeaways: ? When you are doing things for others, check in with yourself to see if you are giving without any expectations or attachment to getting something in return. Ask yourself is this giving really coming from love. ? Reverse the golden rule — Do unto yourself as you do unto others. ? Forgive the past. Let it go. and stop expecting people to change. ? Have gratitude and acceptance if you are the black sheep of the family, and find your soul family. Sponsor: ONNIT: Get a 10% discount on your order by using this link.

During the coaching session with Lena, we uncover some past trauma and guilt which is causing her to feel as if she is living in a black hole.  If you can identify with Lena and are feeling stuck yourself, know that you are headed in the right direction towards getting yourself unstuck. Some people just go through life just going through the motions, and not being inspired. If you are aware of it, you are more likely to discover the trigger, and move past it. If you are a coach, take note of the question I asked Lena when she said she had been doing some personal growth work. Find out what your client's awareness level is, by asking them what personal growth work they have been doing. This helps you avoid telling them something they already know. Also, notice how I reacted when she told me she had cheated, in contrast to my reaction when she divulged the traumatic experience with her father. I acknowledged Lena for her vulnerability, and responded neutrally to the incident, because she already felt shame around it. But, my response to her traumatic experience let her know it was a big deal, and was the cause of her feeling lost. When something traumatic or scary happens, we go into survival mode and we disconnect. We suppress the emotional response because we didn't know how to deal with it. I recommended Lena look into Somatic therapy to help her overcome her past trauma. My Inner Circle Membership Community is an eclectic community where anyone can find a home.

Lena's Question: Lena wants to know how to get out of her \"black hole,\" and get unstuck from her current feelings of discomfort. Lena's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She was scared by the actions of her father, and felt he turned his back on her. ? She feels guilty about the breakup with her ex-boyfriend. ? She suppressed her feelings of trauma, fear, and guilt. ? She has lost herself. ? She doesn't want to be in her current relationship. How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should work with a Somatic therapist to deal with her trauma. ? She should stop compromising in her current relationship and show up authentically. Takeaways: ? Is there anything you haven't forgiven yourself for, or a reason you may be punishing yourself? Where do you think you did something wrong? Why do you think you can't have what you want? ?

"description":"This episode is about overcoming the fear of success and the fear of failure. During the coaching session with Becca, it is clear she intellectually knows what she needs to do to build her business, but she can't commit to doing it.  Everyone defines fear and success differently, but usually our fear of success has to do with being seen more, feeling unsafe, feeling more responsibility for changing, or changing or losing ourselves in some way. Our fear of failure normally has something to do with rejection, loss of money, or status, or security, judgment from others, or our own self-criticism that we endure if we fail. So, how do we overcome these fears? It's about more than taking action steps towards your goals. Maybe, you have tried to overcome it by just doing whatever it is. But, until you upgrade the beliefs and old triggers, which perpetuate the fear, you will continue to find yourself in your own way. Many people think money will make them feel better about themselves or make them more confident. But it doesn't — confidence is an inside job. We can't create self-worth from money, but we can create net worth from self-worth. When we have self-worth and do the internal work, we express our gifts and align with our higher purpose. We are then able to attract money to us. It is important for us to have a wealth consciousness.

Transformations and bonds are created by people sharing and connecting with each other. Email Jill@ChristineHassler.com about joining.  Or, ask Jill about a private one-on-one session. Consider/Ask Yourself: ? What are your fears around failure or success? Do you know what to do when it comes to your business, but you aren't doing it? ? Is there a part of you that has longed to fit in? ? Do you feel guilty if you have too much good in your life? Becca's Question: Becca is about to start a new quest but she finds herself unable to get started. Becca's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She didn't like growing up privileged. ? Cooking is her way of connecting to people. ? Guilt and shame were at the core of her eating disorder. ? She enjoyed having a secret, which was her eating disorder. ? She has an unhealthy relationship with money and success. ? Her guilt prevents her from stepping into her passion. ? She is scared not to have connections with people. How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She needs a new image of what success and wealth look like. ? She should write out her new definition of fitting in, and her definition of success. ? She needs to give herself a feeling of longing and connection. ? She needs to work on feeling grateful. ? She should get a business coach. Takeaways: ? Write out your new definitions of success and failure. Get clear about how you want to define success. ? Write out your worst-case scenarios around success and failure. ? Identify the payoff of your negative emotions and find a way to get the payoff in a positive way. ? If you are starting a business, invest in a coach to help hold you accountable.

"description":"This episode is about becoming a loving parent to ourselves. My coaching session with Joanne is a beautiful example of how important it is to give ourselves the love or attention we did not receive from our parents. Even if you had super loving and attentive parents, you should still be giving yourself the same kind of love.  A lot of people believe they can heal the wounds from their own childhood by being a different kind of parent than they had. And while breaking generational patterns is incredibly valuable, it is only 50% of how we heal. We must mother or father ourselves with the same unconditional love and attention we give our children. Two things often come up as blocks when we attempt to take quiet time for ourselves. One, the guilt or expectation that we should be doing other things that are \"more productive.\" Two, feelings we may not want to deal with can surface when we take quiet, meditative time. People who have children sometimes say, \"My children are my teachers.\" When you have children it is common for things from your childhood to be triggered. Suppressed or forgotten memories start to come forward. It is important for parents to acknowledge there may be something for them to learn from it.

There will be yoga, breathing exercises, ecstatic dance and more. Come and become part of the tribe. My Inner Circle Membership Community is an eclectic community where anyone can find a home. Transformations and bonds are created by people sharing and connecting with each other. Email Jill@ChristineHassler.com about joining. Consider/Ask Yourself: ? What kind of parent are you to yourself? Would you talk to or treat a child the way you talk to or treat yourself? ? How did you feel loved and nurtured by your parents? Are you giving the love and nurturing to yourself? ? How did you not feel loved and nurtured? How can you start giving that to yourself? ? When it comes to self-care and making time for yourself, do you find other 'to-dos' take priority? Joanne's Question: Joanne finds it challenging to provide herself self-care on a routine basis. She continually gives other things priority over her self-care. Joanne's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She's aware of how important self-care is. ? She feels mom guilt when she is not spending time with her baby. ? She is mirroring a pattern her mom had when she was growing up. ? She wanted love, attention and acceptance from her mother. ? She broke generational patterns. How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She needs to mother herself in a way she wasn't mothered as a child. ? She needs to acknowledge herself for the mother she is. ? She should talk to baby Joanne and be with her in a mothering way. Takeaways: ? Make 'you time' a priority, and leave a space open for your feelings to come forward. Suppressing your feelings through distraction will eventually wear out. ? Give yourself the love you crave from your parents, or that you got from your parents. ? If there are issues from your parents to be addressed, write them a forgiveness letter and let them off the hook. ? Have a conversation with your younger self, and tell them anything you yearned to hear from mom or dad but didn't.

"description":"This episode is about taking steps towards your dream. Today's caller, Daniel, is passionate, and his enthusiasm is contagious when he talks about his music. When he deviates from his dream to take jobs just to pay the bills, he gets depressed.  I like to say, dreams are actually our inner psychic knowing what is to come to us. Things we feel called to, from our heart. How do we know what is coming from our hearts and what is coming from our ego? Get clear about it by reading my  What's the Difference Between Sacrifice and Compromise? Vlog post. Our head has wants; our heart has desires. When we are not listening to our heart or we are not pursuing the things we love, a part of us may start engaging in self-sabotaging behavior. It's important to not have the soul sucked out of us. Feed your soul and do things to fulfill your creativity and your passion. Don't let anything suck the soul out of you!

Do you have a limiting belief that you are too old, too unqualified, or too poor to go after what you want? ? If you are in pursuit of a dream, are you actively and consistently taking steps toward it?   Daniel's Question: Daniel wants to know which action steps he should take to pursue his dreams.   Daniel's Key Insights and Ahas: ? He feels pressure to get a regular job. ? He is a perfectionist. ? He doesn't know if he is practical or irrational.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? He should go for it 100%; get his work out there, and identify people to emulate. ? He should put together a demo reel. ? He should hustle for a year before making a decision about additional schooling. ? He should compose his personal mantra.   Action Steps: ? What is your dream? ? Are you going after your dream?

"description":"This episode is about not feeling good enough. Today's caller, Jen, knows it is not good to believe she is not good enough, but she feels her problem is insurmountable. The essence of who Jen is isn't broken, it's just a pattern she's comfortable in.  Jen is experiencing a limiting belief. It shows up in a variety of ways, like her feeling not deserving, feeling broken, or not being lovable. It can lead to insecurity, people pleasing, body image issues, eating disorders, and accepting dysfunctional relationships. During the call, I allow Jen to go on for a while because I am waiting for her to ask for help. For those of you who are being coached or in therapy — If you are more committed to keeping your story than to truly letting go of it, you are uncoachable. We all get attached to our limiting beliefs, because they are familiar, comfortable, and often get us the attention we are seeking and the validation or sympathy for how hard life is. There is merit to discussing our past, and healing memories. But, we must do it with vulnerability, compassion, and forgiveness so we can let it go, to get over it and on with what we want to create.

Jen's Question: Jen wants to know how to move past her past traumas, and change her narrative.   Jen's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She is holding on to an old pattern because it's comfortable. ? She believes her failed relationships and loss of friends is her fault. ? She withdraws and isolates herself. ? She gets her value from external validation. ? She is not seeing her life accurately.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She needs to commit to shifting and interrupting her ingrained patterns. ? She can stop her thoughts of not being good enough, and create a new neural net. ? She should take a lesson from the children she works with. ? She should get a photo of her younger self and talk to it. ? She should create of voice memo of positive sayings to herself.

"description":"This episode is about breaking the cycle of generational patterns. Today's caller, Cathy, experienced corporal punishment as a child, and finds herself doing the same thing to her daughter. As you listen to the call, I hope you are able to separate her character from her behavior. Her behavior is a reaction to her past.  I've said many times, parenting does not come with an instruction manual. Often, we play out behaviors we learned from our parents. It requires a conscious awareness to know what behaviors we want to leave in the past, and which we pass on to our children. We need to have deep compassion for our parents and then forgive them, to stop repeating generational patterns. Stopping the cycle entails awareness, healing of our past hurts, and then the reparenting of ourselves to become the loving parent we never had. Abuse continues because the victim never heals. The victim either becomes the abuser or internalizes the abuse. Often, people do not share about past abuse, because there is so much shame. This is not just true for abuse, it is for any generational pattern. Coaches Tip — When clients share things that are hard to hear, don't go into judgment or sympathy. If you catch yourself doing so, say, \"I forgive myself for judging or feeling sorry for this person,\" then shift back into compassion.

Acceptance versus judgment. ? Compassion versus sympathy.   Cathy's Question: Cathy wants to understand how she may have adversely affected her daughter's self-esteem.   Cathy's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She feels she made mistakes with her first daughter. ? She finds herself going back to the parenting tactics of her parents. ? She didn't like being a girl growing up. ? Her daughter is mirroring her. ? She has unresolved issues from her childhood. ? Her mother didn't defend her.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should talk to her younger self through a photo, and tell herself she did not deserve the punishment she received. ? She should work with a counselor or a coach who has experience with childhood traumas. ? Research parenting and discipline tools. ? When she gets triggered, she should practice giving herself a time out.   Assignments: ? Get a picture of little you and commit to sending love to the little boy or girl inside of you. ? If you are aware of your need for healing, get professional to walk you through it. ? If you find yourself triggered by something, give yourself a time out. ?

He became isolated and disconnected from his intuition, and he cut off listening to his heart because he didn't want to feel.  When we cut off our feelings we not only cut off the pain, but we cut off the love and inspiration as well. What happened in the past does not have to create your future. You can get over it and on with it, but you must be consciously committed to letting it go. To transform, you need love, wisdom, and compassion from your heart, and alchemy. I guided Ravi through a heart meditation, like this one from a Coaches Corner episode. Ravi experienced clarity after the meditation. His heart said it wanted expression through art. The next step was to transform his trauma and pain, but Ravi said he didn't want to go there. Remember, the fear of feeling pain is what keeps you from transforming it. It is possible to alchemize passion, or suffering, into something you love. It takes a lot of energy to suppress pain. If you have had trauma, it can be scary to go there on your own. You should find someone to work with, someone who can go there with you to hold a space for you. The more you listen to your heart, the more it speaks to you! Join me this September at my retreat in Bali. Visiting a magical place with like-minded people will transform your mind, body, and spirit. It's a unique experience where you can experience significant healing that will last the rest of your life. Email Jill@ChristineHassler.com to sign up.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Are you trying to figure out your issues or challenges in your head? ? Were you bullied, teased or criticized as a child or a teenager, and it still haunts you today? ? Do you have a past trauma you are terrified to address and feel? ? Would you say you live more in your head than in your heart?   Ravi's Question: Ravi wants to know how to find purpose in his life.   Ravi's Key Insights and Ahas: ? He disconnected from his conscious mind to cope with the trauma. ? He internalizes the external bullying. ? He's scared of failure and being made fun of. ? He has managed his pain, but has not yet transformed it. ? He is in an avoidance pattern and protective mode. ? He's been in the midst of self-loathing.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? He should tap into the passion he experienced to create art. ? He could help other people who have been bullied. ? He needs to listen to his heart. ? He needs to start alchemizing his pain. ? He should practice release writing when he feels sadness.   Assignments: ? Read The Lesson Quest and Your Life's Purpose in Chapter 9, The Spiritual Level in Expectation Hangover. ? Be honest about what you are attempting to figure out, and alchemize it. ?

"description":"This episode is about issue-based relationships. Today's caller, Rachel, has been in a relationship for 6 years, and for most of that time she has been uneasy and lonely. She says she doesn't know if she should leave the relationship. But as you will hear in the call, Rachel knew the answer to her question before she even asked it.  More often than not, the issue that comes up in our romantic relationships has to do with our parents. Whatever we craved but didn't get from our mother or father, is what we tend to look for in a mate. And, until you heal your core issues, you will continue to seek out approval or attention from your parents, in your romantic relationships. During the call, it was clear to me Rachel was in an issue-based relationship. Issue-based relationships have a lot of chemistry, and the couple is super-attracted to each other. The physical part of the relationship, especially the making up, hooks you in. One of the reasons you are attracted to the other person is because your issues dovetail. The beautiful thing about issue-based relationships is they are learning opportunities. They bring unresolved issues to the surface, which makes them easier to identify and heal. It is time to be honest with yourself about the kind of person you are attracted to. Are you playing out unresolved issues from your past in your current relationships? I recommended Rachel join my Inner Circle Community to give her a support system, and a place where she can openly share. It is truly a place where you can invest in yourself.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Whose love, attention, or approval did you crave the most as a child?  How has that played out in your relationships? ? Are you in a relationship you are questioning? ? Do you know you should be single, but you are frightened by the thought of it? ? Is your connection with a higher power something you would like to deepen?   Rachel's Question: Rachel wants to know if she should stick with a relationship she feels uneasy and lonely in.   Rachel's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She's not sure what she loves about her partner. ? As a child, she craved her father's approval. ? She entered into the relationship without knowing who he was, because she wanted to be chosen. ? She feels like she is falling apart. ? She's unfamiliar with being by herself. ? She needed permission to trust her intuition. ? She feels it's time to fly.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should take a break from the relationship, and work on herself. ? She should ask for help from her higher power. ? She should take a year off from dating. ? She should move out on her own. ? She needs to get some outside support.   Assignments: ? Think about whose love, attention, approval, and affection you craved the most, your mom or dad's? How are you still searching for it in other people? ? Start journaling. A good sentence starter is ... Dear Mom,  I wish you ... or Dear Dad, I wish you ... ? Get individual therapy or coaching. ? Ask for help. ? Make yourself your number one priority. ? Join my Inner Circle Community for support from those who WANT to support you.

"description":"This episode is about freeing yourself from pain and anxiety. Today's caller, Nicole, is struggling to find her true intuition. She feels it may be lost to her, or clouded over by her deep-seated anxiety. She has used her anxiety for many years to protect herself, but she now realizes it is time to get over it and on with it. We made a beautiful discovery together I hope helps you connect some of the puzzle pieces in your own life.  The wonderful thing about pain and anxiety is that we have the power to free ourselves from it. Many of the overwhelming feelings we are having now are rooted somewhere in our past. Something devastating caused our young minds to create a program to follow, so we didn't have to feel that way ever again. As we grow, the ability to address our fears, and overcome our 'victim story' becomes available to us. We are able to comfort our younger selves by self-parenting and through work that is healing. We also have the ability to acknowledge our need for protection, thank it for its service to us, and move our energy to where we need it now. We can then replace our impulsive responses with our inner voice, which is guided by our intuition. When we find our higher purpose, we find another more self-honoring, self-supportive way to get it. Retreat Information — Enrollment is now open for the upcoming Bali Retreat in September. Step into your dreams. Don't let excuses stop you. Contact Jill@ChristineHassler.com to sign up.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Do you suffer from anxiety? Is there something you would like to be free of? ? Whenever you try anything new, does it come with a lot of fear? ? Do you prefer control over uncertainty? ? Did something happen in your past that might still be impacting you, but you are not sure what to do about it?   Nicole's Question: Nicole has anxiety-driven panic attacks, and lacks self-confidence. She longs to have a deeper life and become connected to the world.   Nicole's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She uses her anxiety as a source of protection. ? She needs to feel she is in control of a situation. ? As a child, she felt vulnerable. ? Her intuition will be clearer when anxiety subsides. ? She needs to respond rather than react. ? It's OK for her to make mistakes.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should tell her younger self, \"things will be alright.\" ? Say, \"I accept,\" and then, \"I am choosing to.\" ? Interrupt the patterns of anxiety. ? Turn up the volume of her calm inner voice. ? Understand the difference between resignation and acceptance.   Assignments: ? Think about the \"big deals,\" or significant events in your life. What belief systems were formed then, that might be impacting you today? ? Tell yourself the things you needed to hear during your \"big deals.\" ? Understand that it was not your fault. ? How does your protective mechanism serve you? Give it a new job description.

"description":"This episode is about self-sabotage. Today's caller, Drew, is an inspiring entrepreneur who has overcome odds such as being homeless and obesity but he is still getting in his own way.  I acknowledge Drew for being honest, real and raw during our call. He is a seeker who is committed to his growth. He truly believes he is worthy and is committed to shifting. Often, we doubt ourselves because we haven't made the changes we want, or haven't achieved as much as we would like. The discomfort that comes from the feeling of not living into our potential, and the seeker who emerges from within us, are feedback to let us know we are well on our way. We do not optimize ourselves overnight. Part of living into our potential is feeling and dealing with the pain of not being there yet. It's how we polish the diamond of our spirit. The problem is we label it as suffering because it's uncomfortable. What if feeling a desire to transform is a symptom of being a seeker? It's important to keep going. You will eventually feel a shift. You will start feeling less pain and more purpose. Your focus will shift from yourself to your mission and vision. You will heal core wounds and let go of limiting beliefs. This will attract different things into your life. What you do is not as important as how you do it. Allow your choices and subsequent actions to come from a place of self-love, acceptance, and service. A podcast I did with my friend Aubrey on his podcast is a great supplemental resource to this session with Drew. We talked a lot about self-love, judgment, and the inner critic.  The Aubrey Marcus Podcast #89 — Self-Love and Psychedelic Medicine. Retreat Information — Bali is a place of healing. I have been visiting for 10 years, so my retreats offer an authentic Balinese experience, in addition to the retreat work. Enrollment is now open for the upcoming Bali Retreat in September.

Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Have you overcome huge obstacles, but still don't feel over the hump, or are still facing large obstacles? ? Do you feel like you have something to prove, and is it often the fuel that drives you? ? Are your self-worth and self-love conditional? ? Do you have an expectation to be strong and confident, but feel rejected on the inside?   Drew's Question: Drew would like to know how to stop self-sabotaging himself and how to find the strength to pursue and achieve his goals.   Drew's Key Insights and Ahas: ? He knows he is not broken. ? He feels he needs to prove himself. ? He sees himself through a lens of judgment. ? He puts conditions on his self-worth. ? He has a huge, low ego. ? He has felt invisible and rejected most of his life.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? He needs to create a daily practice around own his worth. ? He needs to become a better friend to himself. ? He should remove the conditions he puts on love, acceptance, and worthiness. ? He needs to stop trying to prove himself. ? He should use the Release Writing exercise in Expectation Hangover before meditating. ? When he feels himself drifting into self-sabotage he should remind himself of his why, his worth, and his true value, and feel love.   Assignments: ? Examine what is driving your behavior. ? Write out your conditions of worthiness. ? Write out new rules, or the truth about your worthiness. ? Try a heart meditation. Allow love to fill your entire physical being.

"description":"This episode is about being conflicted when making a choice. Today's caller, Anna, wants to leave her marriage but is unsure as to whether or not it is \"the right thing to do.\"  There is no right or wrong when it comes to ending anything. Giving up or getting out of something just because it's hard or takes work is quitting, but opting out of something because it doesn't align with your core values is a self-honoring choice. So, how do you know if you are quitting or giving up too early, versus when something has reached its expiration date? I believe any relationship takes work, and can be transformed, but sometimes it doesn't serve either partner to stay together just because they made a commitment, if there is a drastic difference in values and vision. And, having guilt is useless. We feel guilty when we judge ourselves for doing something \"bad or wrong,\" and we think to suffer through the feeling of guilt somehow makes it better. If you are not married yet, my advice is to wait to marry until you are in a place where you are not looking for someone to fill a void or to meet a need, but rather someone to share your life with. Trusting ourselves is important. If you want to live in integrity, you have to have self-trust. You can learn ways to trust yourself in my Inner Circle private membership community. Retreat Information — Bali is a place of healing. I have been visiting for 10 years, so my retreats offer an authentic Balinese experience, in addition to the retreat work. Enrollment is now open for the next Bali Retreat in September. If you have objections, but you really want to do it. Don't let excuses stop you. Contact Jill@ChristineHassler.com to sign up. Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Are you in a situation that has reached its expiration date? ? Are you paying more attention to the opinions of others, rather than your own voice? ? Have you left a situation, but feel tremendous guilt about it? ? Do you tend to jump from relationship to relationship, believing that it will be different?   Anna's Question: Anna wants to be sure she is not making a decision to leave her marriage from a place of fear.   Anna's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She doesn't need someone to make her feel safe anymore. ? She doesn't want her marriage to work out. ? She doesn't know how to deal with the guilt of leaving. ? She needs to take ownership of her feelings. ? She felt she couldn't trust her own voice.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should acknowledge and appreciate everything her husband has done for her. ? She should use listen to her inner voice and find her own truth. ? She needs to forgive herself for buying into the misunderstanding that she was a bad person. ? She should be clear about why she is leaving, and honor it by being a partner to herself.   Takeaways: ? If you are trying to stick it out in a situation out of pride, fear, or worry about what others will think, be honest with yourself, and make a self-honoring choice. ? Reach out to people who support you and can give you spiritual altitude. ? Make a list of all the qualities you want in a partner, and become all of those things. ?

"description":"This episode is about pursuing dreams, overcoming fears, and stepping into the freedom of being an entrepreneur. Today's caller, Katie, feels a calling to start a business as a coach, but fear is holding her back. We don't get out of fear with pep talks or trying to push our way through. We get out of fear through action. One of Katie's action steps is enrolling in B-School.  Fear about what other people think of you will paralyze you, if you are not focused on service and impact. If you make your work about you, it will drain you emotionally. You will constantly be trying to protect yourself from criticism or judgment. It is not possible for everyone to like you. Feedback is feedback. You can choose to get triggered by it, and take it personally, or you can receive it neutrally. You have your own unique group of people you are supposed to help. Stop giving your energy to the people who aren't your people. If you stop analyzing everything, and start taking action, you will be able to use the energy to generate momentum in your business. Please stop wasting your time and energy obsessing about what other people think. If you feel a calling and feel like you have gifts to share, stop stalling, and trust your gifts; it wouldn't be there if it wasn't leading you somewhere. Your dreams and desires are not random. But, only you can turn them into reality. If you desire freedom of time and freedom of self expression, or you can feel a calling to do what you love, enroll in Marie Forleo's B-School. I use what I learned in B-School in my business. It has helped me to uplevel every aspect of my business. Enrollment ends March 3rd, so use the payment plan and get started. It pays for itself. I am offering 4 free 90-minute group coaching calls, access to a private Facebook group, guided meditations, mastermind day and other bonuses because I believe in the program so much.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  Do you feel a calling, but fear is stopping you? Do you want to put yourself out there, but are concerned about what other people will think of you? Do you believe you need to be perfect, and have everything figured out, before you can help others or start a business? Do you worry about being too vulnerable? Are you wondering where the line is between being relatable and being professional?    Katie's Question: Katie would like to know how to get through the fear and anxiety that has come with the attention her new business is getting.   Katie's Key Insights and Ahas:  She's afraid of what people will think about her. She is judging herself more than other people are judging her. She doesn't know where to draw the line, when sharing her personal situation. She knows sharing her story is important. She should lean into her excitement and not the fear and anxiety.    How to Get Over It and On With It:  She should focus on serving others, not on herself. She should own her feelings, and acknowledge she may not be completely through her stuff. She should acknowledge which stage her business is in. She should lean into what she wants more of, and how she wants to serve others. She should get excited about her new business. She should write out her mission and get clear on her why. She should focus on the people who resonate with her.

"description":"This episode is about becoming getting over your past and becoming connected to your heart. Today's caller, Jane is still impacted by a traumatic childhood. She would like to move past it and find someone to share her feelings with.  I acknowledge Jane for her courage and her vulnerability. Just calling in is a testament to how far she has come. It's true that when we are ready, we are guided toward our resources and teachers to help us heal. Jane said she felt anxious. For many people, anxiousness comes from having a chaotic childhood, not having structure, or having too much structure. If it's true for you, don't make yourself wrong, but also don't use your past as an excuse to either be a rebel, or to feel like you can't parent yourself or add structure to your life. You can. Our hearts are an intuitive voice of wisdom, guidance and reassurance. In our logical, mind-based world it is often easier to think than to feel, but emotional processing and healing cannot be done in our heads. People tend to be able to process and release emotions through writing. If you have been repressing your emotions, or distracting or numbing yourself, try writing down your feelings to help you hear your heart. Remember strength is not pushing through something. Strength is vulnerability. To truly live into our potential, we must connect to our hearts. Special announcement — We hit 1 million downloads in February!

"description":"Today's episode is about manifesting a relationship. Leila has been impacted by her father's happiness, or lack of it, much more than she realizes. She would like guidance on how to remove any blocks she has formed.  As you heard in the call, Leila's true inspiration for calling in was the desire to be in a loving relationship, and to understand why she wasn't attracting the kind of relationship she wants in her life. Programming from our past can impact us more than we are aware. In Leila's case, she didn't realize her father's apathy towards his own life affected her. As a child, she felt like he wasn't excited to be with her, and she felt not chosen and not fully seen. She longed for a connection with her father. We can only give the love we give ourselves. A parent's impact on us is often more obvious when they have been abusive or suffer from an addiction. It's important to look at the more subtle things that may be affecting you. Leila also didn't want to take on the responsibility of fixing someone or making them happy. She felt taking on a relationship would be a heavy weight and a burden, and she would be responsible for making the man happy. It's important to note that the role of a romantic partner and role of a parent are two very different things. Listen to my Coaches Corner with Marie Forleo of B-School. B-School is an online business school that covers everything you need to know to start your own business, plus I am offering bonuses because I believe in the program so much.

Consider/Ask Yourself: ? How has your parents' overall level of happiness affected your level of happiness?   Leila's Question: Leila would like to more deeply understand her feelings surrounding her father's work, to make sense of why she has difficulty with committed relationships.   Leila's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She picked up her father's shame about his job. ? She doesn't share details of her life with her father. ? She never felt important to her dad. ? It is not her job to fix her dad. ? She is looking to fill a void. ? She feels an over-responsibility towards men.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? Make a list of what she wanted from her dad, and forgive him for not being able to give her those things. ? It is time for her to get a clear idea of what she wants from a romantic relationship. ? She should step into her divine masculine energy and give herself the validation, appreciation, and encouragement she longed for from her dad. ? She should let go of the belief she has a block towards being in a relationship. ? She needs to break the pattern of believing she needs to fix anyone.   Assignments: ? Look at beliefs or ways of being you have taken on from your parents, and write a letter to them giving those things back. Rip it up or burn it, afterward. Do a visualization of you giving unwanted fears, judgments, or limiting beliefs you acquired from your parents back to them with love and forgiveness. ? If you want to attract a romantic relationship or upgrade the one you have, have a clear picture of what you want and what you have to give. ? Let go of the belief of a relationship block, or you are doing something wrong, and get excited about any investment you make in yourself in a way of giving to your future partner and family. ?

"description":"Today's episode is about stepping out of your comfort zone, and following your dreams. Mel has financial security in her current position, but feels called to do something more impactful. She would like guidance on how to get to where she wants to be.  Mel was experiencing two major blocks: fear, and her own limiting beliefs about not being good enough. When we don't know what is ahead of us, we are faced with uncertainty, and with uncertainty comes fear. Our security doesn't come from an external source. The person who makes you safe is you and your connection to source. I encouraged Mel to take off the golden handcuffs. It may feel like safety and security to her, but it is not freedom if she is not happy, and she feels called to do something more. Financial security and wealth are available through various forms. There is a fine line between fear and excitement. If you are at the tipping point between excitement and fear, I encourage you to lean into the excitement, and stop fighting with fear. Mel's belief of not being good enough was something we all experience at one time or another. I reminded her that we all have an infinite amount of potential. During the call, the use of numbing agents came up. The use of pot, alcohol,  shopping, etc., are common when we suppress both emotion and desire.  Mel had some unprocessed emotion from her childhood, and she felt suppressed by her parents. But, as an adult, she was doing to herself what they did to her. If you use numbing agents to suppress your emotions and desires, listen to my Coaches Corner episode  How to Stop Numbing with Pot.   Special announcement — We hit 1 million downloads!

Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Do you feel imprisoned by golden handcuffs? Do you struggle with the limiting belief of never being enough? ? Do you think following your dreams is careless or risky? ? Do you believe you deserve happiness, and are capable of creating it?   Mel's Question: Mel would like to know how to lessen her attachment to her income and transition out of her current position to follow her passion.   Mel's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She allows fear to make her feel not good enough. ? She doesn't completely believe she can feel happy and fulfilled. ? She believes being happy is being careless, irresponsible and selfish. ? She would like a closer relationship with her parents.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should get clear on what will make her feel prepared to make a change. ? She needs to stop using numbing devices and work through her sadness and anger directed at her mother and father. ? She needs to write or record her vision to reprogram herself.   Assignments: ?

"description":"Today's episode is about how to let go of relationships from your past, and how to heal old wounds. Danielle is consciously aware of what she is going through, but is still triggered by things in her past. One frustrating part of the human experience is when we are consciously aware of something, but we are still affected by it in a negative way. We have to be gentle with ourselves, and know that when we go through a change, it is typical for a part of us to be a little freaked out. And, we don't get over it by giving ourselves a pep talk. We have to go back, and give ourselves permission to feel our sadness or our fear. Danielle was aware of her anxious attachment, and she knew it needed to stop. Her willingness to get over it created the insights and shifts she had during our conversation. If you want to get over a relationship you are invested in, you have to be willing to let them go. Danielle never felt chosen by her biological dad. She had more pressure on her, in her family, than support. She was there for everybody else, but no one was there for her. It was important to get Danielle out of her rational head, and into her heart. She consciously knew her issues, but she kept attracting the same type of relationships, because she never shifted emotionally. My work with Danielle was about going back and understanding what her younger self really needed. I asked her to go back and speak to herself as if she was her father speaking to her, and tell herself the things she wished he would have said. Let go of any belief someone will choose us and make us worthy. I created an Over It and One With It survey, just for my listeners, and I would really appreciate it if you would take 2-5 minutes to fill it out to let me know what you like about the show, and what you want to hear more of.   I will be co-hosting a retreat for men and women with Aubrey Marcus in Austin, TX in April. More details to come!   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Are there things you consciously know, but you are still being triggered and affected? ? Are you still attached, in a relationship or energetically, to an ex or another person in your life? ? Do you think there could be some hurt involving your parents, you haven't quite dealt with? ? Do you keep attracting the same type of person over and over again?   Danielle's Question: Danielle was in a dysfunctional relationship for three years, and is still attached to the person, even though they broke up nine months ago.   Danielle's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She kept her feelings hidden as a child. ? She chose a partner who reinforced her childhood belief that her feelings don't matter. ? Her ex was never there, and was never consistent with her. ? She started her dysfunctional relationship shortly after her father passed. ? She is still wanting a relationship with her father. ? She was told she was supposed to save her parent's marriage. ? She may not have discovered who she really is. ? She will have more compassion for herself. ? She will allow herself to feel her feelings without overthinking them.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She needs to connect to her inner child, and make herself know she is worthy. ? Attend the Women's Spring Retreat in March. ? She should use the Release Writing or Temper Tantrum tools in Expectation Hangover.   Assignments: ? Be honest with yourself about any dysfunctional relationships or anxious attachments, and be willing to let them go. ? Stop using your head so much. ? Allow someone else to help you, by getting a coach, or going to a retreat or workshop.   Sponsor: Freshbooks Get a Free 30-Day Unrestricted Trial to Online Accounting Software.

"description":"Today's episode is about finding your true purpose, and how it relates to your career. Emily is longing for more confidence, and to show up more consistently in her work. She wants to feel more connected to her purpose and the people she feels called to serve. During the call, I switched roles with Emily, because when she felt like she was on the spot, her self-judgment took over, and she couldn't get to the level of clarity she wanted to. She kept coming up with reasons why she's not consistent and sharing scares her. Ask yourself, what are you not doing that you know you should be doing? With what are you inconsistent? Often, we are not all in, because we don't have a big enough why. And, without a big enough why, or a big enough vision, we lack motivation and inspiration. We all have to process enough of our pain to re-orient to be pulled by a vision. If you really wanted to be doing something consistently, you would be doing it. The only true and pure purpose of life is to grow and become more aware of the love and the oneness that we are. But for most of us, that understanding is not fulfilling enough. We yearn to share and express our love in some way. And like Emily, we feel called to make a meaningful impact in the world. And, please, please, please give me some feedback. I created a special survey, just for my listeners, and I would really appreciate it if you would take 2-5 minutes to fill it out to let me know what you like about the show, and what you want to hear more of.

Is consistency an obstacle for you when it comes to taking action? ? Does striving for perfection stop you from taking action? ? Do you know what you should do, but just aren't doing it? ? What is your why? Do you have a vision that pulls you forward?   Emily's Question: Emily is looking for guidance on how to be more open with her clients.   Emily's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She feels people won't take her seriously. ? She is inconsistent in her business. ? She is self-absorbed and lacks a why. ? She lacks self-acceptance. ? She has unresolved pain from her past. ? She's on a mission to figure out who she authentically is.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She needs to write out her why. ? She should commit to a consistent social media plan. ? She needs to meditate and create her ideal client avatar.   Takeaways: ? Be honest with yourself about which pains are still pushing you. ? Get clear about your why. ?

"description":"Today's episode is about being confident in your current relationship. During this coaching session with Nicole, she tells me she is in her first serious romantic relationship, and she is afraid she is going to sabotage it. Nicole is to be acknowledged for her level of awareness and coachability during this call. It was fun to work with her to update her belief systems and to get her excited about learning how to be in a relationship. One thing we didn't talk about was her possible \"Upper Limits\" issue. Nicole is getting more love and emotional availability than she ever has before, which is what she wants; she just doesn't know what to do with it. I wanted to empower Nicole to enjoy the relationship she's in, because it's important to know the difference between when it's time to go back into our past and chip away at something, and when it's time to get over it and on with our lives. So, we worked on Nicole's belief systems, and I allowed her to adopt a beginner's mind. She didn't have a healthy model for being in a romantic relationship, so I recommended she learn about what a healthy romantic relationship is.

Nicole's Question: Nicole would like to know why she feels triggered to leave romantic relationships.   Nicole's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She's afraid of losing the things she cares about. ? She felt her parents were emotionally unavailable. ? She feels it's better to be alone than to feel disconnected when she's with someone. ? She gets panicked in the moment. ? She will try enjoying her relationship more.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should reprogram her brain with her new belief system. ?

"description":"Today's episode is about moving from being single to being in a relationship. I coach Alex on uncovering fears and limiting beliefs that can keep us from being in a relationship, or anything we truly want. When we desire something, and it does not manifest in our life, we have a tendency to blame ourselves, do a spiritual bypass, or mentally obsess about what we need to change and fix about ourselves to make it manifest. Often, these strategies do not work. What does work is taking a deep and honest look at why not having what we want, is actually what we want. Consciously we want something but there is a hidden fear or limiting belief, that is creating a block. For Alex, it was her fear of rejection. Not being in a relationship feels safer for her. It doesn't matter how much she desires something, if part of her is scared to have it, it's hard, if not impossible, to manifest it. This is very different approach than the dating advice we often hear. A relationship is not a symbolic trophy of self-love. If you are single and want to be in a relationship, ditch the apps, the dating columns, and relationship advice for a while, and do some of the things I encouraged Alex to do. Get honest about what really scares you in having what you want. *Coaches — Notice I didn't coach Alex into making a plan to date differently, to love herself more, or to step more into her feminine. Be willing to let go of trying to find a fix-it solution for your clients. Instead, guide them to discovering what is in their way. If your intention for the new year is to connect with a tribe of like-minded people, and to feel and act more confident, joining my Inner Circle will assist you with both.

Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Are you craving a relationship but not having much luck with dating? ? Do feel conflicted about having a relationship? ? Do you judge yourself, or think something is wrong with you, because you are single? ? Is there anything in your life, which is not manifesting, but you don't know why not?   Alex's Question: Alex has reached a phase in her life where she thinks she would like to be in a relationship, but is not sure why she hasn't drawn in a romantic partner.   Alex's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She feels as if she is always pursuing dating. ? She believes she isn't doing something correctly when it comes to dating. ? She is afraid any relationship she gets into will not be successful. ? She fears rejection. ? She knows she is a great catch but may not 100% believe it. ? She feels suffocated when she is overwhelmed by anything. ? She could be scared of herself. ? She feels with her head instead of her heart.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She needs to write out guidelines for what she wants to feel in a relationship. ? She needs to be willing to be vulnerable, and open up her heart completely. ? She should incorporate a meditation and visualization practice into her life. ? She should drop the persona she created to keep herself safe, and let herself be truly seen.   Assignments: ? Ditch the list of everything you want to attract in your life. Work instead to identify the fears that may be in your way. ? Be vulnerable. ?

"description":"Today's episode is about breakups. I coach Jackie through what she calls an earth shattering, heartbreaking breakup, but the lessons that surface during the call can be applied to any type of Expectation Hangover. After a breakup, our hearts hurt, we feel grief, and we miss the person we ended the relationship with. The way to get out of grief is not to obsess over your ex, beat yourself up, or go out looking for someone else. The way through the grief is to milk it for all it's worth, and to see what it is bringing up for you to heal. In Jackie's case, her breakup is an opportunity to reframe old beliefs she had around betrayal. She continued to collect evidence for the story she believed from her childhood. Jackie was basically dating her dad. She was trying to get the love, attention and approval from her boyfriend that she never received from her dad. Remember, whatever you are going through, no matter how challenging it is, remember it is happening for you, not to you. We can get stuck in the loop of pain if we are just looking at the current situation. Don't think a relationship was a failure just because it ended. Some relationships have an expiration limit. Look for the lessons the relationship is there to teach you. Look for the reasons you brought the person into your life in the first place.

The Inner Circle is a membership community where you get access to one-on-one coaching calls, my customized, guided meditations and visualizations, and lifestyle practices. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com with any questions you may have.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? If you are going through a breakup, are you willing to see the pain as a catalyst for growth? ? Are there breakups from your past you got through, but never really got over? ? Could old wounds be impacting the people you are attracting to a relationship? ? Is there someone you know is bad for you to be in a relationship with, but you find yourself going back for more?   Jackie's Question: After a recent breakup, Jackie would like to know how she can move past a relationship that was bad for her.   Jackie's Key Insights and Ahas: ? She feels people are deceptive and tricky. ? She felt lucky her ex chose her. ? She played small around her ex. ? She feels like it's unsafe to be her, and she wasn't good enough. ? She collected evidence to confirm her long-held beliefs. ? She longed for attention from her dad.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should ask herself what she is learning, and why she drew this person to her. ? She should release the judgment that being vulnerable makes her messy or weak. ? She needs to confront the truth that she was the daughter of an alcoholic. ? She should go back and communicate to little Jackie. ? She should find a connection with the divine masculine. ? Write out a reality check letter to herself. ? She should attend My Signature Retreat in March 2017.   Assignments: ? Read and watch my blog and Vlog about  How to Get Over a Breakup. ?

"description":"LIsten in as I coach Anneke on putting her self doubt behind her so she can make the career changes she longs for by tapping into her unique gifts.  It is important we all take time to look at the gifts we were born with. They are the gifts that lead to your calling, and the gifts that make you, you. Often, we disconnect from our gifts and the truth of who we are. It is when we are too paralyzed and blinded by self-doubt that we forget about and disconnect from our natural gifts. This call with Anneke was the first episode of the Over and On With It podcast. This session stands out for me because we explored the question, \"Who am I?\" and because of the level of vulnerability Anneke shared. Remember, we get to choose who we are. Not being who we are can be suffocating. We are not defined by other people's views of us. We are all born with natural gifts from the divine. It's up to us to embrace them and use them. After listening to this call I welcome you to revisit and complete the 'Who am I?' essence exercise from my introductory episode,  The Why Behind this Podcast. Would you like to connect with a community of like-minded people and get all of my #lifehacks? You will when you join my Inner Circle. The Inner Circle is a membership community where you get access to one-on-one coaching calls, my customized, guided meditations and visualizations, and lifestyle practices.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Do you feel like you are really living authentically? ? Are you fully expressing who you are, or are you being a version of yourself? ? Do you struggle with loneliness? ? Are you in touch with your emotions? ? Are you concerned about what other people think of you?   Anneke's Question: Anneke is about to make a big career change and would like to know how to be open and honest about who she really is, and to shift from her pattern of keeping herself small and not seen.   Anneke's Key Insights and Ahas: ? Acknowledging she sugarcoats her difficult emotions. ? She doesn't want to be a burden on others. ? Loneliness has been her friend, because it's when she gives herself a break. ? It's ok for other people not to like it when she is her authentic self. ? Recognizing she is staying in her comfort zone, because those emotions are familiar.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? Try taking actions to trust yourself and be consistently authentic. ? Don't compare yourself to other people, embrace your own essence. ? Be willing to remember the essence of who you truly are. ? Invite spirit into your space. ? Practice self-forgiveness. ? Don't be defined by what other people have told you about you.   Assignments and Takeaways: ? Write out who you are, what is your unique essence? Then, for 30 days get in front of a mirror and make 'I am' statements with your answers. ? Pick 2?3 people to practice intimacy and authenticity with. ? Write a thank you letter to loneliness for giving you time alone.   Resources: Christine Hassler Christine Hassler Podcasts The 'Who Am I?'

Or family dynamics are challenging. And some may be feeling a mix of both. You have moments of peace and joy and other moments of loneliness, anxiety or even sadness. Wherever you are is okay.

"description":"The holidays can be stressful. The good news is, you get to decide how much stress you are willing to take this holiday season. Oftentimes we have stress because we allow ourselves to have it. We say yes to too many things, and we hold an image of perfection, and it is the perfect, perfect, perfect BS, that stresses us out. Remember there really is no stress, only stressful thoughts. This can also be a very lonely time of year. Especially if you are not in a romantic relationship, or recently went through a breakup. There is a blessing to be found in a lonely holiday. It can be a time to turn within and nourish your relationship with spirit. We can practice self-love through the act of being kind, gentle, and accepting with ourselves. Then from a place of self-acceptance, you can set strong intentions, and take action to bring more love into your life. In today's incredibly moving coaching session, Daniel would like to know how to deal with anxiety when he is away from home or in social situations. He is working towards moving past the abuse he experienced in his youth, but he needs practical advice from someone who acknowledges him from a place of love. Our call was less about the why's of Daniel's anxieties, and more about coaching him into the experience of connecting with his younger self. It's his younger self that is being triggered by events, not his grown-up self. All kinds of abuse are painful. But, you do not have to be sentenced to a lifetime of suffering, because you are not a victim. I encourage you to break the cycle of abuse by healing your own. It is time to do healing work with the younger parts of yourself, so you can mentally process what happened, and tend to the part of you that went through the experience. Healing is the application of love to the places inside that hurt. If you are feeling guilt and shame about being abusive to others, your healing involves applying love to the places inside that hurt. Reach out and get support from real people. Therapists and coaches can be extremely helpful in working with you, through dealing with your abuse.   Would you like a behind-the-scenes look into all of my #lifehacks and to join my Inner Circle? The Inner Circle is a membership community where you get access to one-on-one coaching calls, my guided meditations and visualizations, and lifestyle practices. Finally, a place to meet like-minded people!   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Is anxiety something you struggle with, especially in social situations? ? Have you mentally processed your past, but can't seem to shake some of the feelings that went with it? ? Do you have a history of physical, mental, or emotional abuse? ? Do you tend to minimize things from your past, because they weren't as bad as things that happened to other people?   Daniel's Question: Daniel would like Christine to help him through his anxiety in social situations, and to dismantle his protective shell.   Daniel's Key Insights and Ahas: ? He feels physical discomfort from his anxiety. ? He is minimizing his abuse. ? He can't seem to shift his guilt and shame. ? He needs to tend to his younger self. ? He should talk to himself from a place of love.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? He should practice the \"empty chair\" process, and tell himself it's over. ? He should reassure his younger self through a handwritten a letter. ? He needs to be a loving, protective father to his younger self. ? He should visualize a safe place — his grandma's house for example. ? He should start a meditation process.   Assignments and Takeaways: ? Work through the \"Empty Chair\" process, which is included in my Mastery course. ? Create a dialogue conversation with your younger self, through journaling. ? Practice visualization. ?

"description":"Confidence is not something you can develop just by sitting in your house, thinking about all the things you will do when you feel more confident. Confidence is developed by going out and doing those things. Just like we gain courage by feeling fear, and then taking action anyway. We begin to feel more confident, when we actually do things we feel insecure about. In today's coaching session with Teisha, she would like to know how she can gain more confidence, and how she can truly believe she is a prize. We also discover why confidence has been a struggle for her up until now. She wasn't ready to learn the lesson of confidence. Having an understanding of our past is so important to move us forward. During our session, Teisha acknowledged she is safe. That was her key elementary lesson. After recognizing it, her entire energy shifted. She was able to release the judgment of not feeling more confident. It's hard to develop a new quality, when we are judging ourselves so harshly about not being good at it. Coaches, managers, parents, and teachers take note — I got super specific with Teisha about the action steps she was committing to. When walking someone through behavior changes, you want to help them with clear, measurable steps they feel truly committed to. Is avoiding short-term pain preventing you from long-term happiness and fulfillment? What feels worse — experiencing failure and/or rejection, or never stepping into your full potential? Failure is not bad. Failure is necessary if you want to learn, grow, change, and get the things you want from life. So is perceived rejection; if you spend your life avoiding nos, you will never get yeses. Would you like a behind the scenes look into all of my #lifehacks and to join my Inner Circle?

"description":"There are many common, limiting beliefs when it comes to love and romance. One belief is the success of a relationship is based on the time it lasts. So, if there is a breakup or divorce, the relationship was considered a failure. Or, if you love someone, you must love them unconditionally and stay with them, for better or for worse, no matter what. Another limiting belief is, the purpose of a romantic relationship is to find THE one who completes you. In today's coaching session, we bust through the limiting beliefs to get down to love and truth. Today's caller, Andrew, finds himself at a challenging crossroads  in his marriage. He would like to know how to be supportive to his wife after her recent cancer diagnosis without becoming a doormat. Andrew shared he is working towards a growth mindset, and up until now his wife has had more of a victim mindset. While I only got to hear one side, I didn't hear any blame or resentment from Andrew as he shared his story, so I sense his description of the situation is fairly accurate. That is why I coached him to love his wife, to support her and to hold space for her, as she and the entire family process this diagnosis. And in time, have a heart-to-heart with her about how they plan to journey through this Expectation Hangover together. Diagnoses can be an opportunity for deep healing and transformation. Sometimes, what is for the highest good is not always the easiest or most obvious choice. I coached Andrew through the distinction of spiritual connection and spiritual bypass. It basically comes down to love and truth. Andrew loves his wife, but in truth, they may be growing in different directions. Does this mean the relationship should end? I don't believe in shoulds. People in a relationship can be growing at different speeds, but still along the same path. Remember, spirituality is not tolerating people treating us the way they want to treat us. Love and truth go together. Self-honoring choices are often for the highest good of all, and that is the ultimate high road.  We can love, encourage, support, and be an example for people, but we can not save anyone else, that is up to them. Would you like a behind the scenes look into all of my #lifehacks and to join my Inner Circle? The Inner Circle is a membership community where you get access to coaching calls, my guided meditations and visualizations, and lifestyle tips which include beauty, health, and wellness. And, I will be in Sydney, Australia for another amazing Mastermind, possibly a training, and half- and full-day intensives. My visit will focus on the needs of small business owners or those of you transitioning into a new career. You could benefit from a session if you are dealing with fear, are getting in your own way or are ready to take your business to the next level. Send an email to Jill@Christinehassler.com ASAP for more information.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  What soul lessons are you currently learning from your relationship or relationship status? Are you making your relationship with yourself or your higher power a priority? Are any of your relationships at a point where you are growing in a different direction from each other? Do you wonder if being there for someone else in a supportive way is putting your own needs at risk? What is the difference between having a spiritual orientation to your relationship, and doing a spiritual bypass and becoming a bit of a doormat?      Andrew's Question: Andrew's relationship is experiencing trials and tribulations. He would like to know how to spiritually cope with his wife's recent thyroid cancer diagnosis.   Andrew's Key Insights and Ahas:  His wife's hormones have been elevated due to a thyroid problem. He feels spirituality calling him. It's not his responsibility to save his wife.

"description":"Today's caller, Amanda, wants to know how to stop obsessing about calorie counting, her physical appearance, and working out. Like many of the sessions, you hear on this podcast, the focus of our conversation takes a different direction. Amanda acknowledges she felt controlled by her parents growing up. And, the biggest thing I taught Amanda is how we often pair certain behaviors with love. For example, we know our parents are supposed to love us, so the way they parent us is what we think is love. In Amanda's case, it was being strict because she knew her parents loved her. So, she formed a correlation between being strict and controlling, with love. Her attempts to parent herself, care for herself, and love herself the way her parents did, are a big part of her food and calorie counting obsession. She believes that is how she keeps herself safe, much like her parents thought their strict parenting would keep her safe. It ends up as a fear-based version of safety, and it's exhausting. Another thing at play was Amanda's history of rebelling. When we have one extreme that feels limiting, we go to the opposite extreme in an attempt to free ourselves. Amanda felt controlled, so to move away from it, she was rebellious and acted out to get free of the feeling of being controlled. Coaches and Health Professionals — are you practicing what you preach?  Are you attempting to save yourself through serving others? You can share your story and help others, but make yourself your own best client. We can't shift ourselves by saving other people. Remember, it's important for you to show people they do have a wisdom voice inside, and a part of them that is connected to a pure, untainted heart.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Are you a bit of a control freak in your life? Are there areas you are obsessive or rigid? ? Do you have an inner rebel? Does part of you act out or engage in addictive behavior? ? Are you in a profession where you are not practicing what you are preaching? ? Is your self-talk negative, and you would like to shift it?   Amanda's Question: Amanda feels mentally exhausted. She wants to know how to trust herself and change her patterns.   Amanda's Key Insights and Ahas: ? Her obsessing is her attempt to care for herself. ? She's afraid she doesn't deserve a good relationship. ? She believes she is broken. ? She has constructed her persona, and doesn't know who she is. ? She doesn't know how to talk to herself. ? She is trying to use her clients to help herself. ? She should practice what she preaches.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should talk to herself every day from a place of acceptance. ? She should parent herself in a way that is full of unconditional love and support. ? Attend Christine's Spring Retreat to help process her old belief systems. ? She needs to be able to lose control and to know she will be ok. ? She needs to read Expectation Hangover. ? She needs to treat herself like she treats her clients.   Assignments and Takeaways: ? Identify and deconstruct certain behaviors that may be cross-wired with love. ? Consider getting a pet. A pet is a way to learn about unconditional love without getting into codependency. ? If you are in the pattern of control or rebellion, start a spiritual practice.   Sponsor: Audible - Free audiobook download and a 30-day free trial.

"description":"Collectively we are all going through a rebalancing of masculine and feminine energies, not only in what it means to be a man or a woman, but what it means to be human. We are just moving into rebalancing this energy so masculine and feminine energies can be in flow together. While women struggle to find their place in the masculine energy, men struggle to fit into more feminine things, such as being vulnerable or pursuing more creative endeavors that may feel less manly. This is not a time to be discouraged. We are all longing for belonging and connection. This episode is about questioning the old paradigms and rules. Today's caller, Jake, thinks he is stuck, but from my point of view he is at a crossroads. Will he continue to let old programming and belief systems drive him, or will he make a commitment to move past the fear of old paradigms, and step into his full potential? During the call, I didn't want to take Jake down the road of investigating his past, because he had already spent too much time analyzing the past and worrying about the future. Jake said he had an easy-going upbringing without a lot of drama or trauma. Often, feeling that degree of comfort as a child makes it harder to take risks as an adult, because we don't have enough experiential evidence to recover from failure, risks, and things that scare us. We have to stop asking ourselves why, why, why. We don't have to self-analyze ourselves to death. We need to be aware of the patterns and self-limiting beliefs, so we can shift them. We all need to step up into our full potential, and not allow outdated paradigms hold us back. Men, it is ok to be vulnerable, to talk about your doubts, and to admit to confusion about who you are, and how to find your purpose.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Are you a man, or with a man, who is questioning his career path or purpose? ? Is fear something that is stopping you? ? Do you relate to sabotaging yourself?   Jake 's Question: Jake feels drawn toward another career change. He wants to know how to get out of his own head to move forward.   Jake 's Key Insights and Aha's: ? He is sabotaging himself. ? He has competing intentions. ? He has a propensity to not follow through. ? He battles with fear and low self-worth. ? He has time management issues. ? He has created motion toward what he wants by putting himself out there. ? He is afraid he won't live up to his full potential.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? He should invest in a coach. ? He should read The Way of the Superior Man, by David Deida, and other personal development books. ? He should work on shifting his belief system and get clear about what his vision is. ? Over the next 40 days, he should do 10 things that get him out of his comfort zone. ? He should make a schedule for himself and stick to it.   Assignments and Takeaways: ? Go out and engage in behavior which pulls you out of your comfort zone, to develop trust in yourself. ? Commit to rewiring your brain. Visit NeuroGym to learn more. ? Stop obsessing about what you think is a liability. ? Show up fully for yourself, be your own word. Make commitments and don't break them. If you do break them, re-negotiate and start again.

"description":"This episode is about fulfillment and what to do when we start to feel restless, bored, or lose our passion for something. Today's caller, Corey, is feeling unfulfilled regarding his job, but many of you may be feeling unfulfilled in your romantic relationship or friendships. Corey thought the solution to his lack of fulfillment was changing his job, but he didn't know what to do instead. A lack of fulfillment often comes with a lack of clarity. Corey will gain clarity and feel fully, authentically self-expressed, the more he takes risks and listens to his heart. We think that changing the external situation of finding a new job, or finding someone new to be with, is the answer -- that is not often the solution. It could perpetuate the problem. So, what are you truly longing for? Tap into the longing, and instead of thinking you need to change your external circumstances, think about how you can give yourself what you are longing for, now. How can you take action, and create behaviors that support you?  Before you quit your job, or end a relationship, get honest with yourself about what might be there for you to learn, and how you might be creating your own discontent. Often, we feel an inner call to reach out to someone, or to share something, and we ignore it. Please don't ignore it, because you never know what will happen. The only way you can get a no for sure, is if you never ask or never reach out. The only way you are ever going to fail, is if you never try. Regret is far more painful than risk. So, take that risk. Reach out to that person. Speak up. Do that thing your intuition has been nudging you to do. You never know how it will impact the person on the other end. Don't allow your self-doubt, or fear of another person's reaction, to stop you from listening to your heart. Let your intuition be louder than your inner critic.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Is there an area of your life in which you feel unfulfilled? Are you fantasizing about leaving your current job or relationship? ? Do you relate to being a \"yes man,\" or a \"yes woman\"? Are you afraid to say no and stand up for yourself? ? Do you long to feel safe, validated, and accepted?   Corey's Question: Corey is considering leaving his current job but is trying to figure out what is next for him.   Corey's Key Insights and Aha's: ? He feels burnt out and unfulfilled in his current position. ? He felt he was always loved conditionally. ? He searches for external validation. ? He has no idea what is next for him. ? He comes up with excuses to keep himself safe. ? He doesn't feel authentically self-expressed. ? He realizes he has built a box around himself.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? He should take steps to change his behavior and take more risks. ? Transform himself in his current position, so he can move through the reactive energy. ? He should establish a better relationship with himself. ? He should listen to his heart, and act on his intuition. ? He should celebrate who he is, and receive the compliments given to him. ? He should carry a picture of his younger self, and when he is self-defeating he should look at his picture.   Assignments and Takeaways: ? If you feel unfulfilled how can you take responsibility, and change on the inside, instead of making an external change? ? What did you crave when you were little that you didn't get, that you need to give yourself now? ? How can your current soul family support you in making changes? ? Take a deep breath and breathe into the truth of who you are. Then, set the intention to be more authentically self-expressed. ? Speak kindly to yourself.

"description":"When we are so paralyzed by the fear of making mistakes or failing, we don't develop grit. Grit is what gives us confidence. If we don't have to figure things out on our own we find ourselves paralyzed when making choices as we get older. When parents place too many expectations on their children, their children may grow into adults that don't know what they truly want. If you are a millennial, take the pressure off of yourself to make the right choice and allow yourself to make a mistake. Failure is how you learn. If you are the boss, manager or parent of a millennial, stop making all of their decisions for them. This episode will be useful for ANYONE at any age. Today's caller, Lorena, is having a highly-charged emotional reaction to the circumstances in her life. The pressure of living up to parental expectations is clouding her ability to decide what she truly wants.   ? If you are a millennial and you are having difficulty with your parents, remember you are the child. It is not your responsibility to live up to their expectations. ? If you are the parent of a millennial, it's time to let them go so they can be their own person. Let them make their own mistakes. Stop telling them who they are so they can discover it for themselves. ? If you relate to having a high-standard of achievement, don't let achievement to become your identity. Don't let your self-worth be hooked to your achievements.   People get tripped up when they start with the end game instead of having a vision of how they would like to feel. Sometimes it is just about taking the first step. Consider where you may be holding yourself prisoner by letting someone else define you? How can you step into freedom by defining who you are and making your own choices? Coaches - Lorena's belief system was triggering her emotional response. As you can tell by her response, it was greater than what was necessary for what was really going on. Remember, there is what happens, and then what we make it mean. When working with people you want to honor and hold space for their emotions, at the same time ask questions to shift belief systems. Your goal is not to coddle a person but to get them into their insight.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Do you ever feel upset over something you shouldn't be so emotionally triggered by? ? Do you put a lot of pressure on yourself to live up to your own expectations or those of others? ? Have you received a lot of external validation for your achievements, and you constantly crave it? ? Do you feel that you owe someone something, or that you have something to prove?   Lorena's Question: Lorena has recently decided to start over and go back to school to give herself the opportunity to do something greater. But, she doesn't know what she wants to do.   Lorena's Key Insights and Aha's: ? She wants to have an end goal. ? She excelled at academics and was praised for it. ? She feels she doesn't meet her parent's expectations. ? She may be too emotionally upset to reach clarity. ? She doesn't want to end up resenting her parents. ? She appreciates the difference in her life and her parent's life. ? She should use the gifts her parents have given her.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should realize she is the child and she doesn't have to live her life according to their expectations. ? She should express her gratitude toward her parents, plus let them know she needs to make her own mistakes. ? She needs to stand in her own choices. ? She needs to let go of her guilt in order to be free to explore. ? She should write a letter to her parents and ask them to support her. ? She should listen to her inner voice.

"description":"Are you hard on yourself, especially when it comes to your appearance? Do you do something, and then immediately wish you had done it differently? Many of us allow our inner critics to expend energy on low-frequency, physically exhausting, nasty, self-defeating self-talk. You may not realize it, but your self-talk influences the way other people receive you. If you are happy and filled with self-acceptance, you send out a good vibe. If you are negative or hard on yourself, you can suck the life right out of the room. Today's caller, Gabby, is struggling with her weight and self-worth. She is clinging to the away-from-motivation of 'if only I this,' and 'if only I that,' instead of using toward-motivation, to get what she really wants. During the call, Gabby's energy shifts as soon as we discuss creativity and connection. This toward-motivation practice allows her to focus her energy on what she wants to bring into her life, instead of what she wants to move away from. This practice is sustainable, because she is focusing her energy on a positive outcome instead of a negative one. Obsessing about appearance and weight is a waste of energy. If weight is something you struggle with read my book, Expectation Hangover, and: ? Find a new way to soothe yourself. ? Get a new way to feed your soul. ? Commit and take actions towards your commitments. ? Stop making your weight mean something negative about you. You are enough. You are lovable. You can change and heal anything in your life.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Are you making your self-worth and acceptance conditional? ? Do you struggle with body image issues? Has losing weight been a constant theme in your life? ? Does fear of rejection haunt you? Does it keep you from taking risks? ? What are the sneaky ways you're being selfish in your life?   Gabby's Question: Gabby has felt rejected a lot lately and would like to know how she can not worry so much about what others think.   Gabby's Key Insights and Aha's: ? She feels undesirable and fears she is not good enough. ? She has body image issues. ? Food is her only source of pleasure. ? She is self-obsessed. ? She is jeopardizing her relationships by making everything about her. ? She may be attracting rejection into her life when she does, because of her self-rejection. ? She hasn't asked God to love and support her in dealing with her issue.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should stop waiting for external validation to find her confidence. ? She should realize she is not alone in how she feels. ? She should create a joy and creativity plan for herself. ? She should be present, curious, and connected in an authentic way. ? She could ask God for assistance in letting go of her obsession with her weight.   Assignments and Takeaways: ? If there is something you want to shift in your life, make a list of your 'toward' motivations. ? Make a list of what you are committed to, and get an accountability partner. ? Take on a role to shift your confidence, and change the way you see yourself. ? Pray for help with your growth. Ask for help in making the shifts in knowing who you truly are.

"description":"The human experience is a beautiful thing, even when it's challenging. It is sacred when someone is vulnerable. Today's caller, Toni, shares her vulnerability as she asks for guidance. She reveals that many of the decisions of her life come from a place of fear. Toni is confused about what security and love really are. We talk about having a relationship with a higher power especially after she has gone through times in her life when she didn't feel there was any kind of God. There IS some kind of higher power. There are so many names for it, so many ways people interpret it, but to me, it is infinite unconditional love. It may be hard to believe in any kind of God, when there is so much suffering in the world. The best way I can attempt to understand all the horrible things that happen, is that they happen as a result of human choice and free will. While many human choices are still made from a place of pain and fear, we are in a time of awakening. We are in a massive shift in consciousness. What is available to us all, is to make the choice to see the world through spiritual eyes. See ourselves through more spiritual eyes, without judgment; to see through the eyes of infinite and unconditional love. To heal our own pain that is preventing us from feeling connected to a higher power. We are moving into more acceptance, forgiveness and gratitude. If you are craving a deeper spiritual connection, please don't wait for God to prove itself to you -- instead, open your heart, and pray to be shown the way. You are a spiritual being having a human experience. You are one. You are love. You are connected.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Do you feel you are operating more out of fear than faith? ? Are you making a lot of decisions with fear or self-doubt? ? Are you a people pleaser, who is afraid of disappointing people? ? Is connecting to a higher power challenging to you? If you do have a connection, would you like to deepen it? ? Are there situations in your life that make you doubt whether a God exists?   Toni's Question: Toni feels all aspects of her life are affected by her making decisions from a place of fear. She would like to find a way to think more productively.   Toni's Key Insights and Aha's: ? She fears failing and disappointing people. ? Her self-worth is based on her people pleasing. ? She's confused about what security and love really are. ? She hasn't felt protected, or connected to her spirituality, since her father passed. ? She feels like she would be clearer, if she had a spiritual connection. ? She has been operating in survival mode. ? She should know she is not broken. ? She can change her relationship with herself, today. ? She can focus on her blessings, not on her fears.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should realize she can access her spirituality. ? She should start processing her pain, and remove judgment, to arrive at forgiveness and love. ? She should put herself in an environment where she can heal. ? She can start cultivating her relationship with God, by talking to him/her.   Assignments and Takeaways: ? What is in your way of a connection to a higher power? ? What is keeping you in patterns of people pleasing and indecision? ? Do you have old trauma that needs to be processed? ? What beliefs may be keeping you from having beliefs? ? What religious upbringing did you have, which no longer resonates with you? ? You need to find which truth resonates with you. ? Look for a spiritual community of people who are committed to awakening, and who know we are all connected to source.  ? Start to develop a relationship with your higher power. ? Pray.

"description":"Do you feel a yearning to have a child? All women feel a desire to create, to give birth to things and to experience unconditional love. Sometimes, we project that on external things. Or, maybe we women feel we need to have a purpose. It may be that we need to move into a place of unconditional love for ourselves. We need to learn to love and nurture ourselves. You don't want to have a child and then expect the child to fill your inner voids, or to make up for all the places you don't love yourself. We should be as clear as possible about our decision to have a child, before bringing a baby into the world, so we do not project our emotional wounds on to the child. So consider, are you sure it is a baby you want, or is it something else you are yearning for? It takes courage to investigate what is true for us. Today's caller, Jenny, is struggling with whether or not she wants to have children. As we dig deeper, it becomes apparent her issue is really about her honoring her own truth, and how she may not be able to reach clarity on the issue until she clears up some old beliefs and patterns. They are many reasons why you may not be 100% clear about a decision you are facing. Your clarity may be affected if you are not at a good point in life to make the decision, or if you are too impacted by what other people think, or society's expectations of you. You may also have difficulty if you have issues from your past influencing you, or if you are considering the choice as an either-or. All of these things can keep you in limbo. Consider form versus essence, where the baby is the form, and the essence is everything you think that baby is going to make you feel. If you are longing to become a parent, what is it you want to feel, and how can you bring it into your life now? The more you trust you are able to mother or father yourself in a loving way, the better mother you will be. Practice forgiving any misunderstandings about what being a parent means, that you may have bought into when you were a child. My personal mastery coaching course, Over It and On With It, is now open for registration until October 20th, 2016. The 6-week course includes a 90-minute call every other week, worksheets, guided meditations and more. This course is the best of my spiritual practices and practical tips. An investment in yourself is the best investment you will ever make. Go to ChristineHassler.com/Mastery to register or email Jill@ChristineHassler.com.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Are you feeling the pressure of your biological clock? ? Are you struggling with a big life choice? ? In dating, or any other relationship, do you struggle with your own authenticity?   Jenny's Question: Jenny feels the subject of having children is coming up more and more during her relationships, but she's not sure where she stands on the issue.   Jenny's Key Insights and Aha's: ? Her early motherhood influences were not positive. ? She doesn't feel pressure from her biological clock, it's pressure from other people about her biological clock. ? She wants to be married in the future. ? She tends to be repeating the patterns of her mother. ? She may not unconditionally love herself. ? She wants to find the perfect partner. ? She can not seem to get to the root of her issue. ? Her definition of authenticity may need to be adjusted.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She should stop looking to other people to help her make her decisions. ? She should find self-love and self-trust within herself, before making the decision to have a child. ? She should try to bring out the mother archetype within herself. ? She should trust her intuition. ? She should write out her misunderstandings she adopted when she was a child. ? She should ask for guidance during her spiritual practice. ? She should rephrase her authenticity statement.

"description":"Today's caller, Emma, is seeking guidance after a breakup. She would like to move forward with building her business but finds herself battling with self-doubt and procrastination. Emma is taking ownership of the issue and has a high-level of self-awareness about it, but she needs to uncover what is holding her back.  When we ask ourselves the question \"what am I learning from this situation?\" instead of \"why did it happen to me?\" we unlock something which is critical to our growth and healing. When a relationship ends, we are never 100% victims. We need to take 100% responsibility for the 50% which is our part. That said, we must do so without self-judgment or blame. We must accept we did the best we could with what we had at the time, and we now have an opportunity to do better moving forward. In future relationships, Emma has the opportunity to be more intimate. She was playing out the same patterns of withholding and people pleasing in her business, as she did in her marriage. Instead of being vulnerable she felt ashamed of sharing what was really going on in her life. People crave intimacy. Especially those who love us, care about us or want to get to know us. They want to feel like they are getting the real person. It's hard to love someone who is wearing a mask or people pleasing all the time because we never know how they really feel. If you withhold of yourself through people pleasing, perfection or because you don't trust people, it is time to examine that aspect of yourself. Emotional suppression holds energy back. Forgiveness can only begin after we bring acceptance and compassion to our feelings. We are unique but in many ways we are similar. We also have core pains and patterns that hold us back and once we move and shift those, we can move the needle in other parts of our lives. I address core pains and patterns in my Over It and On With It Mastery Course. My personal mastery coaching course, Over It and On With It, is now open for registration until October 20th. The 6-week course includes a 90-minute call every other week, worksheets, guided meditations and more. This course is the best of my spiritual practices and practical tips. Go to ChristineHassler.com/Mastery to register. Allow me to give you the support you need.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Are you a procrastinator? ? Have you gone through a breakup and blame yourself or the other person? ? Do you relate to being a people pleaser? ? Is intimacy challenging for you? ? Would you like to teach your children something you wish you had learned as a child?   Emma's Question: Emma would like strategies on how to move forward after her breakup.   Emma's Key Insights and Aha's: ? She feels as if she wasn't enough in her relationship. ? She is a people pleaser. ? She doesn't trust herself. ? She suppresses her emotions. ? She did the best she could with the tools she had at the time. ? She punishes herself for going after what she wants. ? She needs to get eliminate the belief she needs to be perfect to teach forgiveness.   How to Get Over It and On With It: ? She needs to welcome the emotional aspect of her feelings. ? She should do forgiveness work around her self-blame. ? She should be compassionate towards herself to move into acceptance. ? She can empower her children with the tools she didn't have. ? She needs to believe she deserves her dreams. ? She should create a meditation course for others to help herself heal.   Assignments and Takeaways: ? Write a letter to yourself or another person without sending it. It will help move the energy so it can be healed. ? Take a look at your life and see where you are withholding, not being honest, or people pleasing, and channel the energy to create something fun. ? Empower your children with the tools and knowledge you wish you would have had.

"description":"Today's caller, Trish, thinks she is calling in for career advice but during the session, she discovers her own self-doubt is the barrier to her growth. It takes courage to look inward and see our biggest roadblock is ourselves. We must deal with these roadblocks with compassion and truth. Truth with love, compassion and gentleness is how we must deal with ourselves when we doubt ourselves, question our own worth or create our own suffering.  You must not buy into the belief you must be stern or harsh with yourself in order to shift. Judgment only reinforces a disconnection with your own inner knowing. If you want to be able to tap into your intuition and make choices that are most authentically aligned for you on your soul path, you must be mindful of how you are with yourself. Be a compassionate and honest coach to yourself. Let your mission and your passion become more important than your self-doubt. A major trap for people seeking clarity about their life or career path is they get too far ahead of themselves. If you are full of self-doubt, that is the message you are energetically sending to the universe. Maybe, it is time to update what your definition of confidence is.    Remember: Clarity comes from confidence and commitment. Confidence is full acceptance and compassion. Commitment is making your vision bigger than your biggest insecurity. Anything is possible. You can have what you dream of having and you can be free of what you want to be free of. If you are stuck in your career and you want to move forward with intention, freedom and passion, you can. You are able to remove your inner roadblocks to make anything possible. My very first online personal mastery coaching course, Over It and On With It, is now open for registration.

Do you feel you have to prove something in order to feel confident or capable of going after what you want? ? Is there a vision or mission you feel passionate about but you are letting your insecurities overshadow your commitment to your mission?   Trish's Question: Trish would like help in figuring out her career path.   Trish's Key Insights and Aha's: ? She feels fulfillment from working in a spirituality related business ? Her self-doubt is creating a barrier to her growth ? Her autoimmune disorder may be causing her negative self-talk ? She wants to take a holistic approach to her life ? She would like to feel confident about her abilities   How to get over it and on with it: ? She should treat herself like she treats other people, with love ? She should trust herself more ? She should try not to look at her inner change as work ? She should make her own holistic coaching program and practice on herself ? If she gets in alignment with what she wants more opportunities will come her way   Assignments and Takeaways: ? Design your own self-confidence program and become your own client. ? Practice speaking compassionately to yourself. ? Look to other people who are ahead of you on the career path you want to be on for inspiration, but not for comparison. ?

A bit more about Kate: Kate Reardon has two Bachelor Degrees in Health Science specializing in Complementary Medicine, Naturopathy and Nutritional Medicine. But early on in clinical practice she knew she was never going to be your typical Naturopath or Nutritionist... You see she has a very strong intuition that allows her access to see, feel and know things about people that they often cannot see within themselves. This 'gift', which she has had since childhood (yep she's been communicating with the spirit world a long time), has brought her enormous blessings and challenges throughout her life. She LOVES being able to infuse all of this together. Her work as a Naturopath and Nutritionist is deeply rooted in a holistic approach that aims to heal the body from the core cellular level. And her intuitive metaphysical channeling work incorporates healing on emotional and spiritual levels; therefore her approach to health and wellness encompasses a direct acknowledgement of the 'whole' person - mind, body, spirit.

"description":"Do you relate to yourself as a constant self-improvement project and find yourself overdosing on personal growth? Maybe, you should take a little break to enjoy life. Being in a state of learning and growing is different than coming from a place of \"I need to fix me\". You can not be fixed because you are not broken. Self-love includes accepting and being gentle with our inner critic when it pops up. We are human. We are not going to love everything about ourselves at all times. Self-love is a daily practice of forgiving ourselves so we can take responsibility for our actions without beating ourselves up. Today's caller, Aly, wants to move into acceptance of an illness but she is attempting to do it with a lot of judgment about herself and not from a place of love. Women endure a lot of negative energy and pain about their bodies. Practice appreciation over criticism and pay attention to the gifts your body brings, rather than the way it looks. If you really want your body to look different, commit to treating it differently. Be mindful of the food and substances you fuel it with. Be committed to moving it in a way that keeps it healthy and fit. Our relationship with our bodies boils down to choices. If you have a disorder, illness or are going through a job loss, what are you making it mean about you? We can not always control what happens to us but we can control what we make it mean. You can approach it from the orientation of being a true seeker rather than a fix-it project. Being a constant learner allows you to look at the most challenging things in your life through the lens of \"What is my soul seeking to learn from this?\" And, be cautious of always being right about your story. Be honest with yourself about how attached you are to your story. Often, people don't think they are able to change their story, but they may just be attached to it. We need to believe we have the power to shift our relationship to our stories. Pay attention to your \"if-then\" scenarios. Believing in \"When I do this, I will be that\" is conditional acceptance. I am putting together all of my best tools and resources for you. My video course is coming out in October and it will focus on acceptance — because acceptance is the first law of spirit.

She feels she is not good enough ? She can't seem to accept who she is ? She is afraid to be happy ? She uses her weight as a happiness meter ? She abuses herself and feels guilty about it   How to get over it and on with it: ? She needs to realize she is not broken ?

"description":"Do you honor the changing seasons of your life? As humans, we love the seasons of life where everything feels good and we are full of inspiration. But can we love or accept the seasons that don't feel good? While the winter seasons of life can be brutal, eventually the spring does arrive. If we rush our process or try to push through things like grief and loss, we can harden and suppress emotion which is not healthy on any level. Today's caller, Brittaney, is grieving and finds herself in a challenging season of her life. She recently lost her grandmother and went through a romantic break-up at almost the same time. Brittaney doesn't feel like herself and feels she has lost her passion for life. She would like to get #OverItandOnWithIt but there may be something else she needs to experience first. If you are going through any type of loss, it is important to cry all of your tears. There is a big difference in indulging in emotion and going through the natural emotion of losing someone you love. If you are supporting anyone who is going through a loss, the best way to serve and support them is to hold a space of unconditional love and compassion for them. Let them cry all of their tears so their grief can move through rather than be diverted through distraction or be repressed by being strong. If your romantic relationship has ended, remember that in long-term relationships love isn't enough. The passion and chemistry of falling in love with someone are the fun parts. But it takes a lot more than that to have a healthy long-term relationship.   I am putting together all of my best tools and resources for you.

Have you recently gone through a loss of any kind? Are you in a season of grief and are attempting to rush through it? ? Are you pushing through by attempting to be strong?    ? Do you have people who hold a space for you while you are dealing with your grief? ? Are you someone who may be holding a space of unconditional love for someone else?   Brittaney's Question: Brittaney is having a hard time getting over her expectation hangover. She has recently experienced significant losses in her life.    Brittaney's Key Insights and Aha's: ? She feels she has lost her passion for life ? She accepted grief instead of pushing it away ? Her best friend has been taking the brunt of her hurt ? She has feelings of rejection after her break-up ? She may have been playing the victim recently   How to get over it and on with it: ? She should talk with the person who has transitioned ? She needs to lean on other people in her life ? She should keep her heart open ? She should allow herself to be vulnerable ? She should be gentle with herself and honor the process of grieving ? She should have a good cry and ride the wave of her emotion   Assignments and Takeaways: ? Do you have any buried grief? Maybe it's time to cry your tears and honor your process  ?

"description":"We all have issues or problems in our lives we need to overcome and heal. What things do you believe to be your biggest issues? The key to healing is how we relate to the issue. We can choose to be a victim and allow shame and judgment to rule our lives or we can choose to hang on to our issue because it makes us feel special or gets us attention. We can also choose to believe our problem is insurmountable and even though we feel we have tried everything to get over it, we think we never can.  Today's caller, Jeanette, is feeling she is not enough and she struggles with an eating disorder she adopted in her early teens. She craves acceptance from her family because she has a low acceptance of herself. If there is something you are doing to get love and acceptance or helps you to fit into your family, you WILL have a hard time letting it go. You may have a fear of being authentically you because you worry other people will judge or make fun of you. Remember, we teach people how to treat us. If we continue to show up as a victim or play into the pattern, people will continue to see and treat us accordingly. If someone isn't in a loving, open-minded relationship with themselves, they will not be loving and open-minded with you. Not everyone is on the personal growth journey that you are on. Give the people you love the dignity of their own process. If you want or need to hear something, look into your own eyes and say it to yourself. Be you, step out of your box and don't take things personally.   I am very excited to share an update about my new video course. I am putting together all of my best tools and resources for you. The first video is coming out in October and it will focus on acceptance, because acceptance is the first law of spirit. My gift to you is to be on the list for the first announcement and for the early bird discount. Visit ChristineHassler.com/VIPlist to sign up.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Is there something you have been carrying around for years you just can't seem to heal? ? Do you keep trying to change and to heal yourself but nothing ever shifts? ? Do you feel like your family or friends look at you through the eyes of your issue? ? Is an eating disorder or a body image issue something you struggle with?    Jeanette's Question: Jeanette wants to know how to overcome her feelings of not being enough and an eating disorder she has had since she was 14.   Jeanette's Key Insights and Aha's: ? She feels stuck where she is ? She is contributing to the way others see and perceive her ? She wants to be seen, loved and accepted ? She feels she will be put down if she shares her true feelings ? She is on a journey of awakening ? She needs to free herself from her emotional weight   How to get over it and on with it: ? She should move fully into acceptance ? She should find her voice and speak her truth ? She should say, \"I accept myself and I love myself unconditionally\", every day ? She should write a letter to her mom and her sister, she will never send   Assignments and Takeaways: ? Look into your own eyes and say the things to yourself you long to hear from others. ? Write a letter (you will not send) to get your feelings out and to arrive at the completion of the issue and the pattern. Use these sentence stems: ? I'm mad because ? I'm sad because ? I wish ? I learned ? I forgive you for ? I forgive myself for ? Thank you for ? Why I am letting this go ? Be mindful of using the word 'trying'. ?

"description":"Today's caller, Linsey, is concerned her boyfriend may have an addiction to alcohol. She loves him and believes that if he can change they may be able to take their relationship to the next level. She thinks her problem is in her relationship but as our coaching session shows, it has very little to do with her partner and more to do with something deep within herself.  You cannot change other people. Your desire to change and heal yourself should not be attached to changing someone else. Focus only on yourself.    It is important to make healthy changes, even if it feels really scary. Unhealthy lifestyles feel familiar and safe because we have been in them for so long. It is crucial to find professional support and to be held accountable when we start making changes. It is difficult for us to do this on our own. Our ego doesn't like it when we change because it craves certainty. And, as we start to grow in consciousness, the ego starts to hold on a little tighter. If listening to this call was uncomfortable for you or if it brought up some awareness around your own addictions, consider what you may be using to avoid feeling and dealing. This is why I am creating an Over It and On With It course to give you tools and resources to feel, deal and heal. Coaches — I could have coached Linsey to get out of her relationship. Personally, I hope she does distance herself from it to focus on her own healing. But, if I coached her in that direction she may have shut down. She said she loves him even though she knows he's an addict. She feels safe being a co-dependent in the relationship due to her relationship with her mother. I didn't want her ego to take over and for her to get defensive. It may not have been possible for her to get to the deeper awareness she reached during the call. It's important to give someone the dignity of their process, instead of encouraging them to make a move they may not be ready to make. Would you like to connect to who you really are and discover your Secret Sauce? There is a free video training series on my site to help you build your business or obtain your desires from the inside out. Your Secret Sauce is a unique combination of your experience, talents, life lessons and passions, which can help you to feel a sense of belonging and confidence. Go to www.christinehassler.com/ss to get the free videos.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Are you in a relationship with someone and hope they will change? ? Are you in a relationship with an addict? Are you using an external coping strategy to distract yourself from dealing with something you don't want to face? ? Do you acknowledge that you may have tendencies towards co-dependency? ? Is your ego feeling dark, and would you like to feel more connected to your soul?   Linsey's Question: Linsey is concerned her current relationship may be following the same path as her past relationships, and she is unsure about the future.   Linsey's Key Insights and Aha's: ? She realizes she has co-dependency issues ? She wants her partner to change ? She knows she has walked on eggshells around her mother ? She uses food and television as numbing agents ? She became super-independent because she doesn't believe she can count on anyone else ? She knows she should disconnect from her relationship but doesn't want to ? She can heal this issue   How to get over it and on with it: ? She should be honest about who her partner really is ? She needs to deal with the hurt inside herself ? She needs professional help by way of a 12-step program or a therapist ? She should make a 1-year commitment to not take actions that can't be done ? She should incorporate a spiritual practice into her life   Assignments and Takeaways: ? Take a serious look at your coping devices.

"description":"This episode is for anyone who feels like they are missing out, they are being left behind, they are not enough or they do not belong. Today's caller, Emma, is feeling left out and resentment towards friends who are continuing their relationships with her ex after their breakup. Her frustrations are  bringing up old issues she has been carrying around for a long time. We uncover the constant moving she went through as a child is still a core issue for her. It's important to remember not to minimize things from your past. As a human, there are things you have gone through that are challenging. Things that happen can create certain belief systems and misunderstandings that perpetuate patterns, behaviors and reactions you don't like. Resentment and anger protect us from our deeper feelings. It's easier to feel mad about something than it is to feel the hurt of being left out. We all want to feel connected and that we belong. Feeling separate in any way is painful and it reinforces the core misunderstanding we are separate from God, separate from the universe or separate from each other. Healing that wound allows us to feel we are not separate and to feel we are connected. If you have standards or conditions about what it takes for you to be good enough, know that you are good enough just the way you are. Connect to who you really are and discover your Secret Sauce with the 4-video training series I put on my site for you. Your secret sauce is a unique combination of your experience, talents, life lessons and passions that can help you feel a sense of belonging and confidence.   Go to www.christinehassler.com/ss I invite you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali which includes meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. There are only 2 reservations left. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join any of my events or business programs.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  How often do you experience FOMO (fear of missing out)? Have you just gone through a breakup and are having a hard time with all the transitions and all the loss? Are you having challenges with sharing friends after a breakup? Do you want your friends to pick sides? Do you feel the pressure to pick sides if you ARE the friend of a couple who recently broke up?    Emma's Question: Emma is having difficulty releasing her emotions, which are triggered by her jealousy and frustration over shared friendships after her breakup.   Emma's Key Insights and Aha's:  She's got a bad case of FOMO She has always been hypersensitive about being left out She has always felt like she needed to catch up She feels frustration, anger and resentment She feels relief being able to tie this experience back to core issues    How to get over it and on with it:  She can just be herself and be enough through self-acceptance Let her younger self know there is nothing she needs to do to fit in She should find a spiritual practice and talk to God and the Universe She should free herself up emotionally so new soul friends can come into her life    Assignments and Takeaways:  Look for ways you are trying to fit in or pretend to be someone you are not, and think of how you can show up as fully yourself. Work with your limiting beliefs about being left out. Go back and talk to your younger self and make sure that part of you knows that you do belong. Consider how your spiritual practice is not just about how you connect to a higher power inside you.  It's about connection and love to the oneness we all are. Practice the horseback rider technique from Expectation Hangover when you experience your limiting beliefs. Re-direct your thoughts to \"I belong\". If you are going through a breakup, don't make your friends pick sides.

"description":"Today's caller, Mia, is dealing with sexual harassment from her boss at a newly acquired job and she is scared to stand up for herself. This situation is in no way Mia's fault. While listening, I want you to take note of your reaction to what Mia shares. Does it make you angry? Does it trigger anything in your past? If you react to anything she shares, reach out for help and support. Reaching out for help is the only way to get out of a toxic situation. If you are in a situation in which you feel you are being abused or harassed in some way, please do not keep it a secret. It's important not to allow judgment to blind us from seeing the learning in a situation. Sexual harassment is one of those things that can trigger a lot of judgment. From a spiritual perspective, there is no good, bad, right or wrong. Being disrespected is not something to accept in the name of love or spirituality. However, going into blame mode doesn't solve anything either.  Our relationship with ourselves, from our self-talk to self-perception to our daily habits, directly impacts the people we attract and how people in our lives treat us.  If we want to change the way people treat us, we need to change ourselves first. Coach's Tip - The reason I didn't start off with taking legal action is because it would have been judgmental and highly reactionary. I needed to do some detective work first, to see if this situation was bringing up unresolved issues that were coming up to heal, which is what was happening in Mia's case. I invite you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali which includes meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. There are only 2 reservations left. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join any of my events or business programs.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Is there or has there been someone you felt disrespected or harassed by? ? Do you hold back from standing up for yourself, because you don't want to make waves? ? Are you in an unhealthy situation, but staying in it for money or job security? ? Are there unresolved issues from your past that are haunting your present?   Mia's Question: Mia is uncomfortable in her new job because her boss is sexually harassing her. She would like to know why she may be attracting men who are disrespectful to her throughout her life.    Mia's Key Insights and Aha's: ? Her father didn't show emotions towards her ? She is the first woman from her family to work for a corporation ? She may believe that as a woman, she has to behave differently than a man ? She doesn't trust men  and doesn't feel safe with them ? Her self-esteem took a hit after her last relationship   How to get over it and on with it: ? She needs to update what she believes about men ? She should stand up for herself if she feels disrespected in anyway ? She needs to be in an environment where she is encouraged and supported   Assignments and Takeaways: ? If you feel you are in a situation in which you are being harassed in any way, do not be silent. Seek out some kind of professional support and document what is happening. ? If feeling disrespected is a theme in your life, take a look at your relationship with yourself. How can you shift how you treat yourself, so that consequently other people start treating you differently? ? Do you need to set boundaries with some people in your life, so you feel more respected?   Sponsor: Onnit Wellness - Receive a 10% discount on your purchase when you order through this link.

"description":"It really is so important to give ourselves permission to go after what we want to do. For example, I recently gave myself permission to go on a trip to Colombia with the caveat that I would work while I was there. When I ran into wifi issues and couldn't communicate with my team I had a bit of an Expectation Hangover. So, I decided that instead of being frustrated about it, I would move into acceptance and give myself permission to take some time off. When I fight for my will over thy will I almost always end up getting frustrated. Emily is normally a driven and passionate person. However, she called in because she is feeling a bit lackluster lately.  She's done a lot of personal development work, but can't seem to find her mojo to implement the new things she would like in her life. She's been waiting for something to give her permission to act. It's important for her to start coming up with all the reasons why she can do something, instead of making up excuses about why she can't. Everything begins with just one step. In my book, Expectation Hangover, I call this Proactive Surrender. It's about taking one step with intention and involvement and then allowing for feedback. To co-create is about being in flow with the universe and letting go of attachments of control and planning. Be open to how and where the universe wants to lead you. Also, there are a lot of people who get stuck in the personal awareness trap. People who read a lot of books, listen to podcasts, and become very aware but things don't ever seem to shift for them. If you find yourself in the awareness trap you must start taking action. Coach's Tip - When working with your clients be mindful of having them speak in \"I\" language rather than in the second person because when we speak in the second person we disassociate and we don't own what we are saying. It's important to bring clients back to using \"I\" language without making them feel wrong. I invite you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali which includes meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. There are only 2 reservations left. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join any of my events or business programs.   Consider/Ask Yourself: ? Are you feeling a bit lackluster? Would you like to feel more driven or inspired? ? Do you need to give yourself permission to do something or are you waiting for a permission slip? ? Have you made your human desires bad? Are you trying to get rid of your ego? ? Do you have a heartfelt desire but can't seem to take the first step?   Emily's Question: Emily who is normally driven and passionate finds herself feeling a bit lackluster and lost. She is feeling symptoms of the Imposter syndrome and may be in a personal awareness trap. She would like to know how to get inspired.   Emily's Key Insights and Aha's: ? Her ego isn't all bad ? She needs to listen to her voice of inspiration ? She doesn't need to be an expert to get started ? She has an ability to build rapport with people   How to get over it and on with it: ? She should take the first step and listen to her seed of inspiration ? Realize there is no point to anything ? She needs to step into her gifts and take action ? She needs to own her feelings and use \"I\" language ? Find her internal qualities that mirror traits she admires in other people   Assignments and Takeaways: ? Take action and allow opportunities to integrate into all of your self-health programs.     ? Give yourself a permission slip to go after what you want. Remember, it begins with by taking one step. ?

"description":"Julie began her adult-travels through Earth School as an actress in NYC,  obsessing over yoga, astrology, meditation, and Louise Hay on the side. She had a thing for commercials, and was blessed with many, hawking everything from Diet Coke, to Volkswagen.  She worked her way through the NY theater scene and was gifted the amazing opportunity to originate roles for both Christopher Durang and Neil Simon (on Broadway!).    Then one day, while deep in a dark night of the soul, her guides told her to leave acting. Trusting the inner call, she promptly dialed up her agents...  and the path was chosen.  What followed next was a journey of intense human learnings, blissful soul-discoveries, and every emotion in between. Shamanic travels, yogic trainings, New Thought teachings... the journey was filled with wisdom, and what she learned through it all was that the human-ness is holy, and this life is too precious for words. She finds that laughter is the greatest medicine, and love is the greatest healer. Whichever path you choose to get there, those two seem to remain infinitely true.  Licensed as a Spiritual Practitioner through the Agape International Spiritual Center in 2010, Julie has a knack for helping others to access high truth, connect to their team in the unseen, download pristine guidance from Higher Self, and have fun doing it.  In other words... unpack the BS, and embrace an authentic life of joyful expression and contribution.  She does this through individual sessions, classes, workshops, and writings.  Her unique blueprint to joy involves dogs, nature, laughing wayyyy too loud, and dancing wildly.

"description":"I talk a lot on this show about Expectation Hangovers - how they are the disappointments and curve balls that teach us and grow us. But, it's also important to acknowledge the unexpected surprises that delight us and support us in magical ways. That's why it is important not to plan every little thing, to make space for the unexpected, and to leave more time for soul food. In order to be in this place of space and possibility, we have to come into right relationship with uncertainty.   What is a right relationship?  Realize that we never have total control and that nothing is ever 100% certain. During times of transition, we should honor that we are in a season of  change in our lives. We should not source our sense of feeling safe with being certain of everything. Know that we are always being supported and being guided by the universe even when we feel most lost.    Today's caller is Elle, who called me to discuss her upcoming life transition and the fear she has about it. We hear in this call yet another example of how there is almost always a deeper issue underneath our questions. As I began to shine a light on the dark places Elle had inside, she began to connect the dots and came to some of her own conclusions. Often, people stay stuck on their current problems or questions rather than asking the deeper questions. We can not arrive at clarity until we clear the deeper, underlying issues. We can not move into our full potential if we are playing it safe all the time. Change does not happen in our comfort zone. Bust through your limiting belief that no one will be there for you if you take a leap of faith or make a change. There are so many new guides, angels and soul friends who show up for us at exactly the time we need them to. Changing your vibrations also changes your consciousness. I invite you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali which includes meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. There are only 2 reservations left. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join any of my events or business programs.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  Are you in a transition time or feeling uncertain about things? Are you grasping for control, safety and security? Are you projecting your security on to another person, job or something else outside of you? Do you ever feel alone? Would you like to feel more connected to or supported by the universe?    Elle 's Question:  Elle wants to know how to transition into her new life after years of military service and as a newly single person.    Elle 's Key Insights and Aha's:  She is creating her own fear. She has always wanted to be an entrepreneur. She craves security because she missed out on a developmental phase of her childhood. She dates emotionally unavailable men because that is how her father was.    How to get over it and on with it:  She can heal her lifetime longing for a father. Take this opportunity to delve into the divine masculine and the divine feminine powers. She needs to let go of belief systems that tell her security comes from outside of herself.    Assignments and Takeaways:  Get into a right relationship with your uncertainty. Follow those 'what if' statements with something good. Make future tripping a desirable destination. Find a lightworker to work with. Have one person to shine a light on your dark places. Forgive your parents. Remember that life is full of magical uncertainties and the divine will always have your back.    Sponsor: Onnit Wellness - Receive a 10% discount on your purchase when you order through this link.

"description":"At my signature retreat, many of the women who attended seemed to have amazing connections and gone through physical transformations - in just three short days. It made me think of questions I get a lot, which are \"How do I get to a state of joy and deep connection, and stay there?\" and \"How do I get rid of hurt feelings from the past, which are impacting my ability to be happy in the present?\" When the retreat started, we didn't have the intention to be \"happy\" or better. We started the retreat with acceptance and love for exactly where we were.  Acceptance is the first law of the spirit. This is where the healing and the transformation always begin. We, humans, learn through contrast. Healing is the application of love to the places inside that hurt. Suppression, repression and pretending you are fine are not bringing love to your dark places. The journey is worth it, because on the other side of the dark is joy. True elation comes from being liberated from the judgments and limiting beliefs that unresolved issues and suppressed emotions perpetuate.    Today's caller, Jennifer, wants to know how to be happier.  The definition of happy is a state of elation or excitement. As human beings who learn or grow through contrast, being in a single state all the time should never be the goal. However, being in the state of awareness, acceptance and in the vibration of love is really what we are here to learn how to do consistently. Love doesn't mean being happy all the time. Love is unconditional, it accepts all and it greets whatever emotion or issue we are facing with compassion. Apathy and indifference are the opposites of love. The more we accept the dark and bring love into the places inside that hurt, the less we feel the darker emotions, and the more we experience the state of happiness and heart-opening gratitude and compassion.    *Coaches:  Please don't be attached to pleasing your client by working to get them what they want right away. Ask clients to define things before projecting your definitions on them. As coaches, we are not just listening to words. We are listening to the client's tone of voice, inflection; and we really need to use all of our senses to listen to all of the different ways clients are communicating with us. When the client has an 'aha', encourage them to talk it through.

E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join any of my events or business programs.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  Do you have the expectation that you should feel happy all the time?  Do you sometimes pretend you are happy, when really you're not? Are you waiting for something outside of you to make you happy or make you feel settled? Are you struggling with not feeling happy at all or being depressed? Maybe, you feel that nothing is wrong, but nothing is right either.     Jennifer 's Question: Jennifer wants to know how to truly feel happy in her life.   Jennifer 's Key Insights and Aha's:  She has an unrealistic view of happiness She's trying to source happiness from the outside She pretends to be better than she is She suppresses her emotions    How to get over it and on with it:  Allow herself to feel the tears and emotions when they come She should start by accepting and celebrating who she is She should replace 'fine' with honest answers of how she is doing She should commit to doing a 40-day meditation practice    Assignments and Takeaways:  Take off your mask and let yourself be seen. Don't pretend to be happy all the time. If you need to talk, ask someone to listen.

"description":"Today's caller, Corinna, is deciding whether or not to stay in her marriage. Many of us often struggle with whether to stay or go in a relationship. Sometimes the answer is clear, but often it is not. First, there is the love and the history of a relationship including shared assets, children and pets. Second, there is the uncertainty that goes along with making the decision. Ending any type of relationship is not easy and making the choice to do it is hard. We often look for reasons to blame the other person. We collect evidence against them so our decision to leave is easier. We want to be happy and we think leaving the relationship is the answer. But, just leaving on the energy of blame and rebellion is not enough and does not give the opportunity to learn the lessons the relationship is there to teach us. If we end something out of fear annoyance or blame, we will have to learn the same lesson over again, with someone else.  I've heard people use the advice that the best way to get over someone is to get over someone else. That's terrible advice. You only end up using the person you are getting over and once all the hormones wear off, you will be left with the same unresolved stuff you didn't deal with in the previous relationship. You may then think you keep picking the wrong person, but in reality, the common denominator in the relationship is you. Don't do a reactionary breakup. Don't leave because you refuse to take an honest look at your side of the street. Stop resisting the learning and stop blaming the other person. When we feel blocked about making a choice, it's often because we are not ready to make it. I invite you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali which includes meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. There are only 2 reservations left. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join any of my events or business programs.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  Are you currently in a relationship and questioning whether to stay or go? Is there a big decision you are struggling with that you want clarity on? Are there similar patterns that come up in all of your relationships? Have you done self-work that makes you an incredible partner to yourself and consequently to another? Is there something in your life you are missing or not feeling and you are blaming your partner for it?    Corinna's Question: Corinna is having issues in her marriage. She feels she is isolating herself and is uncertain about her decision to stay married.   Corinna's Key Insights and Aha's:  She already knows what her decision is She limits herself but blames her husband She's gotten lost in her roles of wife and mother She is scared but relieved to start knowing herself There's a lot she hasn't been facing    How to get over it and on with it:  She should read the book Codependent No More Find a counselor or coach to look at how she can show up differently Give herself permission to not make the decision right now Invest time and energy into her own discovery Turn down the volume of the opinions of others  Look at her husband through eyes of observation instead of judgment    Assignments and Takeaways:  If you are struggling with a decision, put it on hold. Make the choice not to choose. Stop talking about your struggles with other people. Focus on listening to your own inner knowing. If you are in a relationship, look at your partner through eyes of observation instead of judgement.

"description":"Today's caller, Frankie is in the midst of her quarter-life crisis. Her life is not going according to her checklist and she is dealing with some Expectation Hangovers. She has defined herself by external things and she's a bit addicted to control and validation. Control is something we all struggle with. We think we have 100% control over life, but we don't.  We do have choices and dominion but we don't have total control. Our egos like to have certainty and to have a plan, which is rooted in fear. It is scary not to know what is coming next. If we try to control every aspect of our lives, we often miss out on all the beautiful opportunities the universe has for us. Sometimes the opportunities come in the form of challenges, which are not to punish or test us but to help us grow. During these times it is important that we do not go into victim mode. It is also important that when we go through uncertainty we don't try to immediately fill up that space with something new. Sometimes we just have to sit in the discomfort of uncertainty to see what it is there for to teach us. If we don't deal with our Expectation Hangovers they will keep repeating and the same types of disappointments will keep coming up.  It's OK if you don't have it all figured out. A quarter-life crisis is normal. It is the time when many of us step into our personal life journey. Challenges are what build our grit and character. I invite you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali which includes meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. There are only 3 reservations left. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join any of my events or business programs.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  Are you having a quarter-life crisis or an Expectation Hangover? Are things not going according to plan? Do you relate to living off a checklist? If things don't get checked off are you hard on yourself? Is external achievement and validation important to you? Are there things you say you are surrendered about but you're not? Are you still trying to make things happen or have you just resigned?    Frankie's Question: Frankie would like to know how to move into a place of acceptance about where she is in her life.   Frankie's Key Insights and Aha's:  She has a should list and a checklist in her head She has a deep strength within her Her identity comes from what she can achieve She is hard on herself more than she is compassionate Love for her is connected to validation and praise    How to get over it and on with it:  She should consider who she would be at 49 if her life had no struggles She can pray without asking for something Her self-talk needs to move towards love and acceptance She can delve deeper in her spiritual practice She should update her story about who she is supposed to be    Assignments and Takeaways:  Listen to my story in my very first  Over It and On With It podcast. Process your emotions through release writing and the temper tantrum technique in Expectation Hangover. Pray. Do not pray for things but pray to be shown the way.  Be nice to yourself.

"description":"Today's caller Jenny is self-aware and well-practiced in personal development work but she is not realizing the consistent results she longs for. Her immediate question is situational but as we delve deeper, she realizes this truly is a core issue.  I begin this episode with talking about the importance of self-acknowledgment... Are you able to dish out all the praise in the world but when it comes to receiving it you become uncomfortable? Often, we don't fully take in praise or acknowledgment or we don't want to feel like we are bragging. Yet, that praise and acknowledgment are what we really want to hear most. So, why is praise from others so hard to accept? It all comes back to our relationship with ourselves and our ability to see what is truly amazing and true about who we are. It also requires a vulnerability to be seen and give ourselves permission to take in the acknowledgment on the energy of self-love and not ego. Receiving praise and love is not indulgent or inflammatory to our ego, it is a gift. If we need it to feel validated or worthy, it reveals that self-acceptance and self-acknowledgement work is in order. I have a feeling that those of you listening could work on flexing your receiving muscle a little more and give yourselves some praise and acknowledgment. Balancing and receiving from a place of love is important. Healing is an application of love to the places inside that hurt. It's more than positive affirmations and re-framing our beliefs, we must first go to those \"ouchy\" parts and fill them up with love. Our higher self is always working to get our attention by creating frustration and discomfort. That is why when we spend a lot of energy suppressing our emotions it wears us out. To liberate ourselves emotionally we need to apply love to the places inside that hurt. I have a free gift for all of my podcast listeners. Here is how to receive my free ebook and meditation downloads. I also invite you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali which includes meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. There are only 3 reservations left. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join any of my events or business programs.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  Do you feel like you are doing the work and possessing awareness but things aren't shifting?  Is it difficult to speak your truth? Does the phrase \"It's better to be seen, not heard\" strike a chord with you? Do you feel stuck in an aspect of your life?  Do you beat yourself up over it? Is self-worth or self-doubt something you are currently struggling with in your own life?    Jenny's Question: Jenny would like help with understanding what is holding her back and how to overcome her fear of success. She wants to get unstuck.   Jenny's Key Insights and Aha's:  It's mandatory for her to go through these patterns as training for her coaching life.  Her upbringing has affected her ability to find her own voice. It's her job to make herself feel worthy. It feels awesome to be heard free of judgment.    How to get over it and on with it:  She should move into accepting this is where she needs to be. She needs to change what she believes about herself. She should work through the emotional section of Expectation Hangover. She can give herself permission to explore the emotions she has locked up inside.  Find a therapist who can work with her on an emotional level.    Assignments and Takeaways:  Emotionally liberate yourself and apply love to the places inside that hurt. Change your story! Ask for praise and acknowledgment and then take it in.

"description":"Let's talk about finding the \"one\". You know the magical person who is your soulmate, your other half, the one who completes you. I say these things with a tinge of sarcasm but I don't inject the sarcasm because I am jaded or don't believe in love, it's there because of the misunderstandings regarding soulmates and the pain many of us go through when it comes to romantic relationships. I believe there are lots of \"ones\" out there for us. My definition of a soulmate is someone who helps our soul to grow. Sometimes it's through a gut-wrenching break-up, sometimes it's through dating someone who triggers us and sometimes it's through someone who just comes in, loves us and holds up a beautiful mirror to  remind us of who we truly are.  Soulmates can be romantic partners, friends, colleagues and even someone you share a plane ride with once and never see again.   So, why are many romantic relationships so painful? 1. The relationships are mirrors which can trigger unresolved issues from our childhood. 2. We often look to a romantic partner to fill our needs that our parents did not meet. This doesn't attract the best people to us. 3. We may want a relationship so badly to fill our voids or make us feel less alone that we move into a fantasy-based relationship.   Today's call with Michael is a beautiful example of masculine vulnerability and strength. He finds himself dating from a place of pain rather than from love. He wants to move past the feeling that he needs to prove himself to women. Michael's mother wasn't really there for him and so he ends up with women who don't treat him well and who are not really there for him. This is the problem with trying to fill a void left by a parent through dating. We long so badly for the love of a parent that we attract someone just like them, which re-opens our unhealed wounds. We have to bring love and forgiveness to those places inside and fill ourselves with our own loving acceptance. It's time to let go of our fears about rejection, abandonment and getting hurt.

E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join any of my events or business programs.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  Are you longing for a soulmate so much that it is causing you to suffer? Do you keep dating the same person but they have a different face? Could issues from your childhood influence who and how you are dating? Are you in a fantasy based relationship? Could it be time to remove your rose-colored glasses?    Michael's Question: Michael wants to know how to move past the pain of a previous relationship and how to know when the person he is dating is the right one.   Michael's Key Insights and Aha's:  He is trying to heal a core wound from his childhood through a romantic relationship He is putting a lot of pressure on the women he dates He realizes he keeps running back to fix past relationships He carries fear and his unanswered questions around with him He feels unworthy and feels he needs to prove himself to women His strength is in his vulnerability, his honesty and his courage    How to get over it and on with it:  He should forgive the misunderstanding that he is unlovable or anything in his past was his fault He needs to re-parent his younger self in a way he always longed for  He needs to take a dating hiatus     Assignments and Takeaways:  Is there a little boy or girl inside of you that has some misunderstandings which really need to be healed?

"description":"We all go through different phases in life such as graduating, finding our first job, a mid-life crisis, marriage, having a child, starting a company, retiring, etc. There are also different seasons in life to go through which come more frequently than phases. Like the times when we are busy at work, slowed down because of an illness, distracted by a relationship or just going through internal growth; and things that require us to change our pace or priorities. Consider this, life of an athlete, metaphor shared with me by my friend Lewis Howes. You are not always in the play-offs. In fact, you would burn out if you were. There is a training season, game season, the play-offs and then of course, offseason. To play at their best, players respect the season they are in. It's important that we respect the seasons we are in to be our best in life. As I have said before, we often wear our busyness like a badge of honor. Somehow we have made doing, doing, doing greater than being, being, being. We are constantly going for things as a distraction. When we are consistently going for the next big thing we don't have to feel the little things (that are really big things) we sweep under the rug because we just don't want to deal with them. AND, we are addicted to control. We are great at putting time and energy into the results we want. The more effort we put into getting what we want the more we feel entitled to get the results. When we get what we go after, we win. It brings a sense of security and accomplishment. We feel safe and on track and we want more. But why do we want more? Because it gives us the feeling of control and we love control because the unknown is downright scary. The truth is we really don't have control over our lives. And nothing illuminates that truth more brightly than an expectation hangover. Today's caller, Lisa, relates to being a doer and an overachiever. She wants to know what her next big thing is. Even though she may not have given herself time to experience some recent transitions and expectation hangovers in her life. As our souls grow, our higher self and our inner wisdom know exactly when the right time is to process something. Sometimes we are not ready to deal with something. Sometimes we don't remember something until later. But when it does start to come up, it is so, so crucial that we respect it and be with it. Coach's Tip - Coaches may notice my style is a bit different in this call. I could sense Lisa is a highly, intelligent woman who likes to figure things out. And, because I knew figuring things out was of value to her, I wanted her to have the experience of figuring things out but in a different way. It was important she connected to her own inner wisdom about what she really needed. It was simply my job to hold the space for her and to ask her questions. Remember, realizations people come to on their own are profound. I have a free gift for all of my podcast listeners. Here is how to receive my free ebook and meditation downloads.

Consider/Ask Yourself:  Are you going through a transition and trying to \"figure out\" your next steps? Do you respect the seasons of your life or are you consistently putting yourself in the play-offs? Have you ever been called or referred to yourself as a control freak? Do you relate to being more of a doer than a feeler?    Lisa's Question: Several major changes in Lisa's life have her confused about where to go and what to do next.

"description":"Insecurity can be painful and it blinds us from seeing who we truly are. We are not born insecure, we become that way. It's a feeling we have based on the beliefs we accumulate when people are critical of us or we feel judged in some way. The problem is, we live in a world where most people are pretty hard on themselves and it leaks into people being hard on other people. People who have snapped at you or criticized you aren't bad people, they are probably just very critical of themselves.  The bottom line is when we are able to clean out our insides we act differently on the outside. Confidence doesn't necessarily come from doing things, it's more about coming into self-acceptance by dropping our internal critical voice and truly liking ourselves just as we are right now. You don't have to be perfect before you can accept yourself and you cannot make your self-love conditional. You are the one person you need unconditional love from. Today's caller Lily is taking a huge step toward building her confidence. Her father has been critical of her and his critical voice became her internal critical voice. She paired his criticism up with his love and now she thinks the way to get love is to criticize herself.  Often, the things we think are protecting us are the things that cause us the most suffering. So much about building confidence is about what you stop doing rather than what you start doing. Take a learning-oriented approach to life. Look at what you are attracting without self-blame or thinking you did something wrong. Things are not your fault. They are there to help you stop the voice of judgment and your internal critic. Coach's Tip - Getting over self-criticism is liberating. It is a very important part of being a coach, a light worker or just a loving human being. When we are confident about who we are and we are showing up with our hearts open in full authenticity and when the voice of the inner critic is silenced by our unconditional love, our hearts become open to others and we show up as a more confident and more loving person. The more you accept yourself from where you are right now, the more you can approach growth and change and evolution from a place of love rather than from a place of judgment.  Remember, whatever we can do for another we can do for ourselves. I have a free gift for all of my podcast listeners. Here is how to receive my free ebook and meditation downloads.

Consider/Ask Yourself:  Is your confidence level affected by the level of criticism you apply to yourself? Are you looking for something outside of yourself to make you feel confident rather than cleaning up your internal self-talk? Do you desire to be more confident? How often do you doubt yourself? Would you like to be free of the doubt? Are you someone who answers \"fine\" (aka feelings inside not expressed) when asked how you are? Was there or is there someone in your life who is critical of you?    Lily's Question: Lily is having a hard time believing in herself and finding her own value.   Lily's Key Insights and Aha's:  She hides how she is truly feeling with \"fine\" She feels shut down when she opens up and shows her vulnerability She may be uncomfortable with her own vulnerability Being criticized by her father may be affecting her confidence She must seek change from the inside, from herself    How to get over it and on with it:  She should shift from victim to student She can try to re-parent herself with the voice of an unconditionally loving parent Forgive her father She should speak to herself...", "title":"41: Be More Confident and Less Critical of Yourself", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script>

"description":"This episode is about liberating yourself from any kind of shame and the secrets and judgments that go along with it. When we feel ashamed of something we keep it in the dark and that is why shame is so toxic because it leads to keeping things hidden, keeping things where they are tainted by judgment. Shame often stands as the guard at the gate to vulnerability. The incredible, painful feeling of shame is based on the misunderstanding of a perceived flaw that we believe must stay hidden. The way to get through shame is by stepping into vulnerability and revealing what we are terrified of being found out for. We all want to know that we are loved even if we have these dark, scary, shameful feelings and thoughts. Today's caller Sara is taking a huge step toward vulnerability. Sara displays remarkable courage by sharing her secret so openly. I sense a lot of you will relate to having secrets or things you are ashamed of or like Sara, an STD that you feel taints you in some way.  To heal shame, we not only have to do our inner work  but we must also have the courage to bring what we judge as dark or tainted into the light to talk about it. We don't have to shout out what we are ashamed of from the rooftops, but it's important that we do not live with secrets. Being raw and real in front of others is an important part of healing any expectation hangover. We cannot talk ourselves out of trauma and shame. We have to feel our way through it. We have to go back to those inner places that got hurt, with compassion and the willingness to feel the feelings we never really got to feel. It's an important part of the healing process. We can't get #overitandonwithit by just thinking about it. We have to go back and treat the wound. The more you heal core wounds, bring shame into the light, forgive and reframe how you see yourself, the more you will shift in how you are seen. The universe brings things into our awareness to help us heal not to punish us. If we can reframe how we look at them even the terrible things can be blessings. Listen in and be part of the conversation that breaks down shame. And, I have a free gift for all of my podcast listeners. Here is how to receive my free ebook and meditation downloads. I also invite all of you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali which will include meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join any of my events or business programs.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  Are you carrying around a secret? Do you have an STD, an illness or situation that negatively impacts your dating life? If you are experiencing shame, are you ready and willing to be vulnerable?  Are you harboring anger or resentment against anyone or anything which is preventing you from feeling the liberation and love that is your essence?     Sara's Question: Sara is having difficulty finding her self-worth in relationships when they begin to get intimate.   Sara's Key Insights and Aha's:  The more judgment she places on herself will lead to judgment from others She tries to overcompensate in other areas of her life Her masculine and feminine energies may be out of balance She is bringing her shame into the light by sharing She attracts the kind of love she reveals She can be compassionate with herself and love herself unconditionally    How to get over it and on with it:  Realize she is not damaged goods and she is not tainted She should do some forgiveness work around her mistrust Be mindful of the story she tells herself about having an STD She can go back to her 24-year-old self and provide her solace If she heals herself on the spiritual level it can help her on the physical level Have a 'cut the cord' ceremony to release her anger towards the other person    Reminders and Takeaways:  Vulnerability...", "title":"40: Healing Shame and Knowing You Are Lovable - No Matter What", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script>

"description":"Today's coaching session is with Kelsey, who is on the precipice of the next stage of her career. The subject of our session has to do with generating money in your career, specifically doing work that feels purposeful. It's also about building momentum and stepping fully into the things which matter most in your life so that 1) You can create results and 2) You are more fulfilled.  Towards the end our conversation you can hear a shift in Kelsey's voice and energy. You can hear what happens when she shifts fully into her own. This is what happens when we step fully into owning our gifts and experiences. It is highly important to get fully in alignment with who you are and what you are here to do but be aware of competing intentions. If a small percentage of you believes something is not possible, it will be more challenging to make it possible. Know at what stage you are in your career. In the beginning when we are just starting something, it's normal to have side jobs and then moonlight doing what we love. The wonderful thing that happens with experience is that different skills are honed. We start to become more confident in what we do. We embody it even more and we trust that the universe will lead us exactly where we are supposed to go. We spend much more time worrying about things than we do being strategic and focused towards what we want. Be aware of unconscious collective beliefs like \"I can't make money doing what I love\", \"What I love isn't a real job\", and the like. You need to get rid of those beliefs because even if they seem minimal and if they are there, some part of you believes them. And, if making money doing what you love is a priority for you, I highly encourage you to apply for my Secret Sauce Business Training Program. The program teaches heart-centered entrepreneurs how to build a business which makes money doing what you love by stepping into your unique gifts, talents and experiences.  I have a free gift for all of my podcast listeners. Here is how to receive my free ebook and meditation downloads. And, I invite all of you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali which will include meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join any of my events or business programs.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  Is there something you really feel called to do but you just can't seem to make money at it? Do you truly have faith and believe 100% that you can be financially prosperous doing work you love? What is your relationship with money like? If you were to grade your wealth consciousness, how would you evaluate it?    Kelsey's Question: Kelsey has a heavy heart because even though she is currently living her passion, she must struggle to pay her bills every month.   Kelsey's Key Insights and Aha's:  She was never taught to manage money She doesn't trust 100% that she is working towards her calling She can feel that she holds herself back with limiting beliefs She has access to resources she doesn't use    How to get over it and on with it:  Knowing she can be prosperous and financially abundant doing what she loves She should look at her belief system with regards to money She should understand her self-worth and shift into alignment with what she is creating She should get into full vibrational alignment with generating her income by doing what she loves to do Connect with people who are prosperous doing what she wants to do She needs some inner work and outer work to change her story    Reminders and Takeaways:  Be aware of your competing intentions.

"description":"The number one reason social anxiety is so painful is because it reinforces the illusion of separation. We are all connected, we are all one but we live in a world which makes this so hard to remember. The illusion of separation starts when we are young and we get teased or separated based on our grades, behavior or gender. It continues through our lives and makes us feel not part of something. Understanding that you are not alone, you are not separate and you are no less than anyone else is imperative to your emotional well-being and health. But, it's not always easy. Some of us have painful experiences from our past that make social situations and making friends harder. Not everyone is an extrovert and for some people walking into a place where they don't know anyone is like hell on earth. Remember, all people need friends and a soul family. Accept that about yourself and don't use being introverted as an excuse not to go out and connect. The more you stop worrying about what others think and just show up authentically, the easier it will be to connect and the more your social anxiety will dissolve.  People are people, not big scary monsters. The next time you go to an event, have some questions in mind you can ask people beyond \"How are you doing?\" or \"What do you do?\" In today's coaching session with Jenna, we explore why she is feeling social anxiety and isn't able to maintain long-lasting friendships. And, I share why I was guided to coach her in a way that would shake her up a bit. I have a free gift for all of my podcast listeners. Here is how to receive my free ebook and meditation downloads. Also, I invite all of you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali, which will include meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join the festivities.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  ? Do you suffer from social anxiety? Do you dread just thinking about going to an event or initiating a conversation? ? Is making friends challenging? ? Do you want more friends? ? Are you frustrated because you want to change something but just can't seem to change it? ? Would you like to feel more connected in your life? Are you honest with yourself about why you keep yourself separate?    Jenna's Question: Jenna is frustrated over her inability to get over her social anxiety and is looking for guidance on how she can move past it.   Jenna's Key Insights and Aha's:  ? She may be triggered by feelings of rejection from her mother ? She believes there is something wrong with her ? She realizes that people aren't thinking about her as much as she thinks they are ? She has all the ingredients she needs to be a friend and to connect    How to get over it and on with it:  ? She has to stop making things about her ? She should practice being invested and connected to other people  ? She should write down the reasons why she is a great friend and read it every day ? She can be honest and simply ask for a friendship ? She should tell herself a different story    Reminders and Suggestions:  ? People are not thinking about you as much as you think they are. ? Remember people are people. They are not big scary monsters.  ? Focus on what you can give. Think about all the amazing things you can bring to a friendship. ?

"description":"Most of you can relate to feeling a bit nervous or awkward at times. Maybe it's around someone you are crushing on, when you have to speak in front of your boss or even when you are attempting to be cool with your teenage kids.  Feeling self-conscious is the worst. And not just because of the knots in your stomach, the sweating, the saying of the things we judge as totally lame right after they come out of our mouth. What is worse is that we are not showing up as fully ourselves. Whenever we are openly attached to hoping someone else likes us or accepts us, we often do the exact opposite of what we need to do in that moment. We judge ourselves rather than accept ourselves. Then we show up in ways that are not authentic to who we are and that is awkward and uncomfortable. Attachment is thinking we need to be a certain way to get what we want from another person. We put on masks, we judge ourselves and we edit everything that comes out of our mouth. The higher the emotional stakes are the more suppressed we can become. In today's coaching session with Kristen, we explore why she is not fully herself in romantic relationships. Self-consciousness is not just painful to feel, it also doesn't bring us the connections we long for.  First, it's all about what you are telling yourself inside your head. Second, you start future tripping which detaches you from your intuition. Finally, being attached to the outcome, you are trying to adapt to who you think you need to be rather than just being you. The cure for self-consciousness is radical self-acceptance. I invite all of you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali, which will include meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends.

And, consider my  Secret Sauce event for people who want to uncover their unique secret sauce and uplevel their business, start a new business or make a career transition.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  ? What situations do you feel self-conscious in? ? What do you really want when interacting with others? Validation, to be liked? ? Is there a parent or someone else you may be expecting to get nachos from when they are really a Chinese restaurant? ? Are you truly showing up in a way for others that you expect others to show up for you?    Kristen's Question: Kristen would like to know why she finds it hard to be herself around a guy she is attracted to.   Kristen's Key Insights and Aha's:  ? She is still angry over her father's aloofness ? A father is the first male relationship a girl has ? She may be looking for acceptance and validation when dating ? Anger and judgment do not help any situation ? She should establish intimacy and trust with her dad    How to get over it and on with it:  ? She's free to be whomever she wants to be ? She should share her needs with her father ? She needs to accept people as they are if she wants to be accepted for who she is ? She is responsible for her own needs right now    Tools and Takeaways:  ? Look at where your self-consciousness comes from and practice being in the present moment. ?

"description":"There are endless distractions in our lives. Just one glimpse of Facebook or Snapchat and the next thing you know it's an hour later and you've gone down a rabbit hole. Practicing self-care is not as enticing as our phone, the TV or a glass of wine but the payoff is far, far greater. But why is self-care so hard sometimes? How come we know we \"should\" do things like mediation, journaling, exercise, etc but we don't actually do them (or stick to doing them)? Because self-care can feel like punishment if we don't have enough fun and play in our lives. Self-care activities are all solo activities, so instead of us feeling replenished after we do these self-supporting things we may feel isolated. We are spiritual beings having a human experience and as humans, we need 3 types of connections. The first connection humans need is to our higher power (insert your terminology here). The second is to ourselves and the third is to others. If you are not connecting, playing and doing the things that feed your soul then you are going to want to rebel in some way. If we don't get play in a healthy way then we indulge and procrastinate, all the things which move us away from our self-care practices. If you know what to do in terms of self-care but you are just not doing it, then you will relate to today's caller Helen. Helen is wondering why she's not doing the things that are good for her. She goes through spurts but then she gets busy and goes back to old coping mechanisms. We are able to change our state at any time but it takes focus, some intention and a willingness to get into a different mindset and heart set. When we start making decisions with our intuition and not with our head, we can consider our options and then \"feel\" into them to help decide which is the most fun! If it has been a while since you've played and you feel a refresher course is needed listen to this week's Coaches Corner as I speak to my friend Charlie. Charlie specializes in teaching us how to love and how to play.  Also, I invite all of you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali which will include meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends.

And, consider my  Secret Sauce event for people who want to uncover their unique secret sauce and up level their business, start a new business or make a career transition.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  ? Are you feeling stuck or blocked with regards to your self-care? Do you know you \"should\" but don't seem to do it? ? Do you have a community of like-minded people you are connected to? Are you getting your soul fed? ? Do you make decisions with your head or your heart? ? Do you know how to play in a way which takes your mind off of everything else? When was the last time you actually played?    Helen's Question: Helen wants to know why she can't seem to do the things she knows are good for her.    Helen's Key Insights and Aha's:  ? She doesn't feed her soul enough ? She is experiencing an Expectation Hangover about her new endeavors ? She needs some connection and play    How to get over it and on with it:  ? She should make decisions with her intuition and not her head ? She should then follow through with the decision her heart makes ? She needs to feed her soul and add more play in her life    Tools and Takeaways:  ? Listen to the  How to Stop Sabotaging Yourself podcast again.  ? Be diligent about connecting with your spiritual, like-minded tribe. And, remember to drop your guard so that you can be truly seen. ?

And, while external results are great, the key is to increase our joy and our passion is through the process.  Stop waiting for something to happen to start living your heartfelt desires. No one else is going to come along and grant all your wishes. If you are a musician, sing or play your instrument every day. If you are an artist, draw or paint every day. If you are a writer, write every day. If you are a coach, find someone to connect with and serve every day. Whatever that thing is you want to be, do it now. It doesn't matter if the form isn't exactly as big or in the exact package that you want, you can express the joy every day or at least every week. The same goes for waiting for someone else. You cannot wait for a person to come along to make you feel a certain way. If you are single and are longing for a romantic partner to feel love and connection, you need to generate those feelings inside yourself. Have an open and full heart instead of being down in the dumps and thinking something is missing. Remember that we are the source of everything in our life. We do not have 100% control over external events but we do have a choice over how we want to feel. You are the source. In today's call with Melissa, we dive into how she can get her mojo back and how she can get and stay motivated by doing or creating something every day to help her connect with the joy of the process.

And consider my  Secret Sauce event for people who want to uncover their unique secret sauce and up level their business, start a new business or make a career transition.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  ? Are you struggling with your mojo or having a hard time getting motivated? ? Are you waiting for some external thing or person to grant your wishes or make you feel a certain way? ? Are you more attached to results and not enjoying the process of your life? ? Is there someone you feel obligated to please by having amazing answers to their questions about your dreams, career or love life?    Melissa's Question: Melissa wants to get her mojo and confidence back regarding her acting career.   Melissa's Key Insights and Aha's:  ? She may be experiencing adultolescence ? She's looking for something external to re-ignite her mojo ? She can make her vision clearer ? She teaches people how to treat her by her responses to their questions ? Honoring herself will help get her mojo back    How to get over it and on with it:  ? She can direct her life more instead of waiting for things to happen to her ? She needs to generate inspiration from inside herself ? She can try to create opportunities to connect with other people ? She can start creating her own content and do it every day ? She should honor her choices and stand by them    Tools and Takeaways:  ? Write down or act out the times in your life when you had mojo and use it as a reference point to connect back to the feeling. ? Act the part and create the feelings you want to feel every day. ? Practice responding in a different way to those people who make you feel pressure. Be congruent in your own self-acceptance.

"description":"How are you at making a choice? Do you suffer from analysis by paralysis? Often, we are so obsessed with making the wrong choice we find ourselves paralyzed in the limbo of indecision, which can be hell. Even those big leaps of faith decisions which include a high degree of uncertainty need resolution. You cannot choose wrong, so I encourage you to JUST choose. The only way we get support from the universe is if we take a step and make a decision. You must be 100% all in to get its support. Today's caller Cecilia wants permission to make a decision. She has allowed logistics to block any action she is considering and she is overwhelmed with the \"how's\" and hasn't fully examined the \"what if's\".  Remember, it's never too late to go for your dreams. My  Why Going for Your Dreams Matters Most...No Matter What podcast addresses how to move past fear and doubt to hear your inner voice. Coaches take note - I wanted to get Cecilia out of her head and more into her feelings. I knew talking through her issue wasn't going to get her anywhere. So, I set up 2 situations, I painted a picture and laid out what the outcomes would be if she chose option A, and I did the same for option B. Then I allowed her intuition to choose the outcome. I invite all of you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali which will include meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join the festivities. And, consider my  Secret Sauce event for people who want to uncover their unique secret sauce and up-level their business, start a new business or make a career transition.   Consider/Ask Yourself:  Is there a decision you are having a hard time making? Are you living in limbo land as you analyze the decision you have to make? Are you waiting for permission to do something you know in your heart you want to do? Do you collect evidence that supports your dreams or supports your fears?     Cecilia's Question: Cecilia would like to know if her longing to be somewhere else, is the universe calling her to go there or if she has glamorized a moment in time.   Cecilia's Key Insights and Aha's:  She feels relieved when someone gives her permission She knows she runs away from things She's living in limbo land She's not resisting the push towards making a clear choice She doesn't have a lot to lose    How to get over it and on with it:  She should answer her what if's She should get aligned and behind one decision She should project 20 years in the future to see if she regrets her inaction Understand the universe will support her and the decision she makes    Tools and Takeaways:  Get 2 sheets of paper and write one choice on one of the sheets and one choice on the other sheet. Then step forward using your intuition onto both sheets of paper at different times to see how your body reacts. This provides incredible feedback. Give yourself permission to choose and permission to take a leap. Listen to my Coaches Corner on  How to Get Over Feeling Lonely.

"description":"People pleasing will not get you the kind of love you\nlong for. Why? Well, when you are putting other people's needs\nbefore your own, you are not being honest. You are not showing up\nauthentically.\nPeople pleasing can range in severity from caring\nabout what people think to being a doormat. In my view, no degree\nof people pleasing is a good thing and being a complete doormat is\ndangerous. Think of a doormat after being used over and over. This\nis what happens to your spirit and your spark if you allow people\nto walk all over you. Your light starts to dim. You start to fade\nand you start to wear down. \n \nThe Importance of Connection When Going\nThrough a Loss\nWe are not meant to grieve alone.  One of the\nmost healthy aspects of grieving is having support. You may find it\nhard to ask for help but you are giving another person a gift when\nyou are vulnerable with them. Do not suffer in silence and\nsolitude. The things that help the most are often the hardest to\ndo. During difficult times, we need to do the hard things to get to\nthe healing place we long for. \nToday's caller Shaun called in for some guidance\nwhile going through his divorce. He may be putting himself last and\nhas a habit of people pleasing which is making his divorce\nharder.\nDon't lose sight of yourself during a loss. I\nencourage you to be honest with yourself about your people pleasing\npatterns.\nCoaches take note - I try to stay as clear and\nneutral as I possibly can, but during some calls, like this one, I\nslip from empathy to sympathy. I found myself being protective of\nShaun and judgmental of the situation. I then moved back to\nneutrality which allowed me to guide Shaun appropriately.\nI invite all of you to join me for my retreat in\nmagical Bali which will include meditation, yoga, one-on-one\ncoaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. E-mail\nJill@ChristineHassler.com for information\non how to join the festivities or to join me in Los Angeles in July\nfor my signature retreat.\n \nConsider/Ask Yourself:\n\n? Are you going through a\nloss right now and feel disconnected?\n? Do you relate to being a\npeople pleaser or a doormat? \n? Are you concerned about\nwhat people think of you and often put others' needs and opinions\nin front of your own?\n? Is there someone in your\nlife you need to draw some boundaries with?\n? Do you have a solid\nsupport system of people or just one person you can turn to who\nwill listen when you are going through something challenging?\n\n \nShaun's Question:\nShaun would like to know how to get un-stuck after\nbeing blindsided by a breakup from a 15-year marriage. He wants\nadvice on how to move past the situation.\n \nShaun's Key Insights and Aha's:\n\n? He has a pattern of\ntaking care of others at his own expense.\n? He may be losing his\nidentity.\n? He doesn't have a social\ncircle for support.\n? He should reach out to\nnew people and ask for help. \n\n \nHow to get over it and on with\nit:\n\n? He should step into his\npower and his strength and put himself first.\n? He should meet new people\nand join new groups.\n?

"description":"Do you exhibit a type of behavior or personality trait you don't necessarily love about yourself? It could be moodiness or it could be being extremely judgemental or it could be an emotional state you have a tendency to default to like sadness, worry, anger or fear.\nWomen often have a difficult time dealing with anger because we have not been encouraged to express it. We may default to sadness which limits us from reaching our passion and our fire. We suppress our emotions and any big emotion we suppress will eventually leak. Anger becomes irritability, sadness becomes depression and shame comes out as insecurity. Suppressed emotions can also lead to physical ailments. It is not healthy to suppress our emotions.\nToday's caller Monica acknowledges her own moodiness and is wondering if it is something she can change or if it's a fixed personality trait. She suppresses her anger and doesn't speak her truth.\nIf there is something about you that does not feel good to you, like moodiness, you can change it. You just need to uncover why it's there in the first place. Moodiness can be a messenger that you may be suppressing pent up anger and frustration. It is liberating to express your anger and be free of the moodiness.\nI invite all of you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali which will include meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join the festivities or to join me in Los Angeles in July for my signature retreat.\n \nConsider/Ask Yourself: \n\n? Is there something about you that you would like to change? Is it an inherent part of your personality or do you believe you can change it? Are you willing to do the work to change it?\n? Do you experience times when you are irritable or snap at someone? How do you express your anger?\n? Do you feel self-expressed? Do you fully feel your feelings?\n\n \nMonica's Question: \nMonica recognizes she is a moody person and would like to know if she is able to shift out of it or if it is part of her personality.\n \nMonica's Key Insights and Aha's:\n\n? Her moodiness stems from suppressing her anger \n? When she speaks her truth she feels shut down\n? She has trouble expressing herself \n? She doesn't like conflict\n? She becomes the victim, as a coping strategy\n\n \nHow to get over it and on with it: \n\n? Realize her irritability and bluntness are actually inner anger leaking out\n? She should do the Temper Tantrum technique and 32 days of the Release Writing technique, which are in her copy of Expectation Hangover\n? She should step away from the conversation and get her anger out, on her own\n\n \nTools and Takeaways: \n\n? Identify the ways you may be leaking. Know where you are suppressing and how you may be expressing it in other ways.   \n? If you sense you may have anger you have yet to acknowledge, start Release Writing.\n?

"description":"We all, especially women, have struggled with body image, at least one time in our lives. The media and society at large do not make having a healthy body image easy. I want to highlight the fact that if we took all the mental energy people spend on thinking about, obsessing over and criticizing their bodies, and shifted it into thinking about how we could serve the world, change the world and solve big problems, imagine how different the world would be.\nIf you are expending a lot of your own mental energy focusing on how you look rather than on how you feel and what you want to contribute, consider re-directing it. \nIn my 20's I was never diagnosed with anorexia or bulimia but I definitely would say I had body image issues. I possibly had body dysmorphia, which is when your obsession with how you look and what you eat gets in the way of your happiness and your ability to connect. I don't think I saw myself accurately. I was working as a personal trainer and nutritionist, so I was super obsessed about what I ate and I possibly had exercise bulimia too. If I ate \"bad\", I would be driven to tears with guilt. This went on for a few years until some major things shifted.\nIt finally subsided when I committed to the type of personal and spiritual growth work I teach on this show. I focused more on working out and body image than I did on really diving in and doing the work. I also dealt with feeling out of control in my life. I had left my job and I didn't know what I wanted to do in my life. I had a huge expectation hangover in terms of where I thought I \"should be\". I had so much uncertainty.\nThat is when I started a meditation practice and that really helps me to feel more settled and more present. The out of control feeling comes from when our mind is just going and going and we are future tripping all the time. That led me to create a much stronger spiritual practice and relationship with God. I was so self-obsessed I felt very, very separate. I didn't have a strong spiritual connection to begin with but the more I leaned into it, the more I talked to God and read spiritual books, the more the connection deepened. I got a purpose which was bigger than me. I got clear on what I was truly hungry for. I was hungry to serve. I was hungry to learn. I was hungry for spiritual connection. When I started to feed myself with what I was truly hungry for, the obsession with food, diet, exercise and body began to melt away.\nAny disorder, addiction or illness is there to get our attention. It is an indicator that there are unresolved issues we are working hard to suppress. It's a red flag that we are craving something and we are trying to feed ourselves through whatever the addiction and disorders are. These disorders reinforce the pain of separation. When we do things that are dangerous, even hurtful to our well-being, it's a cry out for God, for remembrance, for the awareness that we are so loved, whole and complete exactly as we are. \nToday's caller, Anne, has been in and out of therapy for her eating disorder so I took a different approach with her. We worked on healing her bulimia with love. \nI invite all of you to join me for my retreat in magical Bali will include meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends. I E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join the festivities or to join me in Los Angeles in July for my signature retreat.\n \nConsider/Ask Yourself: \n\n? Are you so obsessed with your body that it affects your emotional stability, everyday decisions or relationships?\n? Have you gone through treatment for a disorder but just can't seem to be free of it?\n? Are you aware of what you need to do to heal but cannot seem to integrate it?\n\n \nAnne's Question: \nAnne has been struggling with bulimia for over 12 years.

"description":"There is a difference between being alone and feeling the pain of loneliness. We do not have to suffer from the pain of loneliness if we are enjoying a connected relationship with our self and a higher power. We are never really alone, and the illusion of the separation of God, higher power source or universe, is one of the core misunderstandings we are all here to overcome.\nIf we tell ourselves things like \"I'm alone, I hate being by myself, something must be wrong with me, I really need to be with other people\", then, of course we feel the pain of loneliness. It's very human to want to be connected and to make sure we are getting our soul food by spending time with people we love.\nFeeling isolated or disconnected is incredibly hard. But sometimes it is the pain of loneliness that inspires us to do the work to nurture a better relationship with our self, or to create or deepen a spiritual connection.   \nThis is exactly what is on the soul agenda for today's caller, Christina. Her question initially is about the assumptions she's making that are sabotaging her relationship, but her core issue is fear of being alone. She has a track record of being in toxic relationships or relationships she truly doesn't want to be in just because it was better than being on her own.\nRemember you are never truly alone. You are always connected to infinite and unconditional love from God.\nI invite all of you to join me September 16-22 for my retreat in magical Bali which  will include meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the opportunity to meet soul friends.

"description":"Our dreams come from our inner wisdom and our wants come from our ego.\nWe all have things that happen in our lives, which create fear, uncertainty, doubt and self-limiting beliefs. Often, we try to ease the pain of those things by chasing after something. For example, if you are really hard on yourself, then you may spend a lot of time wanting someone else to love you. You have a high want for a romantic relationship or you have a parent who was really hard on you or only validated you for your accomplishments, and you may have grown up with the feeling of unworthiness and high want for money and success.\nEgo-based wants come from feeling 'less than', and then searching for something or someone to fill the void. These kinds of wants are not coming from an authentic place, because at the authentic self-level we know that absolutely nothing is missing. The want is coming from our ego. When we obtain our ego-based wants, they only give us a temporary sense of satisfaction. They do not cure the deep longing we feel for worthiness, belonging and love.\nHow do we know something we are longing for is not an ego-based desire but a true dream we must pursue? It comes down to the feeling of longing, which we feel in our heart, not in our head. Our dreams are a psychic prediction of what is coming; we feel a deep longing to experience something because we know that on some level, it is our destiny.  We can't always control the form and timing of it and that is where suffering can come in.  It is imperative we pursue our dreams on the level of essence, not form; and we focus on the feelings we long to feel rather than try to make it happen or get attached to how we think it should happen.\nAn example of this is, perhaps you feel a longing to make an impact on the world. You feel a deep desire in your heart, which is almost painful when you feel you are not doing it right now. Instead of trying to figure out what business to start to make a difference, focus instead on the feelings you want to feel and then begin to take aligned actions in that direction. Set the intention every day to be of service and ask to be used as an instrument of impact. Look for the simple ways to make an impact right now. When it comes to dreams, waiting is not a good idea. Take action now to move you in the direction of how you want to feel and what you want to experience. The biggest roadblock to going after dreams is fear. Nothing silences the voice of your inner wisdom more than doubt and fear. Honor your dreams and stop being so scared. \nToday's caller, Anya is scared and feels guilty about wanting to go after her dream because it was not her original plan.\nI invite all of you to join me in September 16-22 for my retreat in Bali will include meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the finest conversations with like-minded women. I will also be available for personal sessions. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join the festivities or to join me in July for my signature retreat.\n \nConsider/Ask Yourself: \n\n? Do you know what your dreams are? Are you terrified to go after them?\n? Do you feel stuck because you do not know how to turn your dreams and longings into actual steps?\n? Are you concerned that if you don't go after your dreams soon you will spend the rest of your life regretting it?\n\n \nAnya's Question: \nAnya has been feeling lost because she is passionate about acting but she is afraid to follow her dream.\n \nAnya's Key Insights and Aha's:\n\n? She feels the pressure of the expectations others have of her\n? She is embarrassed that her dream is different than her education\n? She needs to take the first step\n\n \nHow to get over it and on with it: \n\n? She can give herself permission to stand for her dreams\n? She should communicate her dream to others\n?

"description":"Have you ever had something come back around like a romantic relationship, friendship, job or career path that you thought was over?\nOr perhaps you've gotten a second chance with a different situation or cast of characters.  Like a new relationship after a divorce or a job after being laid off. Or even your health after getting to the other side of an illness.\nSecond chances do happen for all of us and when they do, it is important that we apply the lessons we learned the first time around.\nMany of us are great about doing this because we are intentional about not wanting to repeat the same kind of what we'd call mistakes again.  We approach second chances with gratitude and excitement.\nBut second chances can also produce fear.  What is fascinating (and rather sad) about us humans sometimes is that the closer what we truly wants gets, the more we attempt to push it away.  Obviously this is not a conscious thing we do, the saboteur is very sneaky...yet powerful. And the reason we sabotage is because we have not fully healed the core issues and misunderstandings around love and worthiness.   \nYou'll listen to an example of this with today's caller Jenny who has gotten a second chance in regards to a romantic relationship.  She would love to just feel grateful and excited, yet what she is experiencing is a roller coaster of emotions. \nThe time is now for her to accept that she is truly worthy of love. She can open her heart, expose her vulnerability and bloom into her feminine aspect or she can go to her protected, solitary place. Being honest and vulnerable in her relationships will allow her to let someone special in without feeling fear. \nCoaching Tip from this call: Focus should be on learning and not on the outcome. Dropping our ego and adopting a learning oriented approach to life serves both client and coach, equally.\nI invite all of you to join me in September for an my retreat in magical Bali will include meditation, yoga, one-on-one coaching and the finest conversations with like-minded women. I will also be available for personal sessions. E-mail Jill@ChristineHassler.com for information on how to join the festivities on September 16-22.\n \nConsider/Ask Yourself: \n\n? Have you recently gotten a second chance at something and if so, how are you approaching it?\n? Is there someone or something you would like a second chance with?\n? Do you truly know you are deserving of love and/or success?\n? Do you get anxious about a relationship, and experience a roller coaster of emotions?\n? Ladies, do you live in your in your masculine energy a lot? Gentlemen, do you have trouble connecting to a woman who experiences a roller coaster of emotions?\n\n \nJenny's Question: \nJenny wants to know why she reacted like she did when a nice guy wanted to be her boyfriend and what tools she can use to stay in the present and to drop the anxiety.\n \nJenny's Key Insights and Aha's:\n\n? She doesn't feel worthy of love\n? She is being vulnerable and it feels uncomfortable\n? She may feel like a fraud when accepting love\n? She can feel safe receiving love\n\n \nHow to get over it and on with it: \n\n? Focus on the shared visions and values\n? Recognize self-worth\n? Talk to anxiety in a feminine, loving way\n? Shift awareness and let love in\n\n \nTools and Takeaways: \n\n? Stay in the present and be grateful for all you have\n? Think of the ways you can be more vulnerable\n?

"description":"Why does our list of requirements for a lover, looks a lot like a job application? There are considerations for height, weight, and experience. Did we meet the person based on a reference from someone else? Do they fit into our mold of the \"right one\"?\nWhen we focus or obsess more on how the relationship is progressing than the quality of the experience, we miss out on why we are supposed to be in the relationship in the first place. What we are questioning is not actually a real dispute. We are creating doubts in order to use them as distractions so we do not have to address the real issue, which may be something from our past we need to let go of.  \nToday's caller, Jennifer, wants to find a reason she should not be dating her younger boyfriend. She says he is supportive and loyal, which are both things she believes she wants from a relationship, but she can't seem to make herself trust that his feelings are real. As we drill down to the actual issue, Jennifer realizes she may be the one who is holding the relationship back and that it has nothing to do with age. \nA special note to the coaches who are listening - if I had formed an opinion about the age gap in Jennifer's relationship, we may have never gotten to the root issue, which is a core wound that needs healing.

What if you were told these things when you were young? Would you still be searching for your soulmate to complete you?\nWhen we are born we are complete. We have a sense of unconditional love and acceptance. As we go through our human existence, we are influenced by others around us and we tend to believe what they tell us as truths. Since those people have been apart from source love for a longer time, they say things which may not be encouraging for us. We then experience the illusion of separation. We feel a longing for the love and acceptance of others to fill the void and heal our core wound. \nIf you have ever chased love, been deeply hurt by a breakup or felt addicted to another person, you are unconsciously longing to find your way back to source love. The hurt may be hard for your ego to accept but your soul needs internal love, not love from another person. It is time to reprogram yourself. It is time to move away from being a victim and time to release your anger instead of recycling it.\nToday, Deborah thinks her issue is about her indecisive new love but we find out it is not really about him but about her and her story, which is ripe for being revised.\nIf anything in this episode resonates with you, get my book Expectation Hangover and come to one of my signature retreats.

"description":"Being \"busy\" seems to be a way we identify ourselves.  We run ourselves ragged trying to meet the expectations of our bosses, our colleagues, and our families. We begin to put our needs aside in favor of what others want. To compensate for not practicing self-love, we wear our busyness as a badge of honor, which only seems to distract us from the lack of balance in our lives. We run the risk of having our children believe that stress equals success.\nThe distracting device which is busyness cannot go on forever. We start to tear apart at the seams. Our inner self is crying out for attention and it becomes rebellious in order to get what it needs. While it looks for compensation, we are moving on to the next thing. Feeding this longing will serve us better than if we try to push right through.\nFulfillment will not find us until we stop, refuel and rebalance as part of a daily practice.

"description":"If you have pattern of being in relationships or going after unavailable people (either emotionally unavailable or still in relationship with others), then this episode is a must listen!! You'll also lean about what I call \"Journey Mate\" relationships. \nWhen we are first starting a relationship we often try to be the person we think we need to be, rather than our most authentic selves. We believe we need to be a certain way in order to keep the other person attracted to us. What we think is love for the other person is actually a projection of the qualities within ourselves we would like to develop.\nWhen the relationship ends before we think it should, even if it doesn't feel like it at the time, the relationship served us in some way. The other person was a journey mate. Journey mate relationships are a projection of what we need to see in ourselves. If the relationship doesn't end and we continue sourcing our love from the other person we end up codependent. If this happens we may never fully express ourselves or stand in our power.\nI define authenticity as the freedom to be fully expressed. If we are not authentic in our relationships we cannot expect to find the most aligned person for us. More than likely we end up attracting unavailable people who are not ready for commitment.\nSteph believes perfection is required of her in her relationships. And since perfection doesn't exist she experiences Expectation Hangovers, especially in relationships where she feels unable to be her authentic self. Aspiring for perfection has blocked her ability to be emotionally vulnerable. \nIf you have a pattern of attracting unavailable people or have just lost someone you thought was the one, listen to this call and Saturday's Coaches Corner. \nMy book Expectation Hangover is now released in paperback and has a new subtitle - Free yourself from your past, change your present and get what you really want. If you don't have a copy of it yet order it on amazon, audible or enjoy the company of others in a bookstore.\n \nConsider/Ask Yourself: \n\nDo you feel you are living an authentically, self-expressed life?\nDo you have a pattern of attracting unavailable people?\nAre you in a relationship with an emotionally unavailable person? Are you an emotionally unavailable person?\nDo you think you have to be perfect (or a certain way) to get the love you want?\n\n \nSteph's Question: \nSteph finds herself attracted to emotionally unavailable people and it's hard for her to show her vulnerable side in relationships. She wants to know how to shift to become emotionally available.\n \nSteph's Key Insights and Aha's:\n\nShe has a hard time showing her vulnerable side\nShe doesn't trust love and can't get it until she fixes herself\nShe sourced loved through someone else\nShe doesn't feel good enough\nShe is capable of being her authentic self\n\n \nHow to get over it and on with it: \n\nShe should come back to what love really is\nShe could accept herself fully and completely\nHer awareness is the first step of change\nWrite out what perfect and authentic means to her\nTake a hiatus from dating for a while\n\n \nTools and Takeaways: \n\nWrite down all the things you learned from your journey mate relationship and then turn that on yourself\nDefine authenticity and understand how your most authentic self feels, behaves, communicates and loves\nUnderstand where you have walls up around your heart and how you can let people in more\n\n \nSponsor: \nOnnit Wellness - Alpha Brain\n \nResources:\nChristine Hassler \n@christinhassler on twitter\n@christinehassler on instagram\nchristine@christinehassler.com", "title":"24: Stop Attracting and Dating Unavailable People", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script>

"description":"Criticism seems to have the stickiness factor of super glue and compliments seem to be coated in oil. We allow hurtful things to play over and over in our heads like a broken record, especially when the recording came from a parent or an authority figure. \nWe create patterns out of the programming we receive when we are very young. These patterns stay with us throughout our lives until we reprogram ourselves. We can default to these patterns when dealing with situations and we tend to sabotage ourselves with fear instead of motivating ourselves with affirmations. We treat ourselves as others have treated us, instead of how we want to be treated.\nIf you have a vision to impact other people's lives, make sure you have saved yourself and let down your own walls first. In order to be transparent, authentic and true, you should become your own best client. How you do anything is how you do everything. \nToday's conversation with Rich is a lesson in how not to be a victim. Rich has wanted to create a deep emotional impact in people's lives for some time. He started his own coaching practice over a year ago, and is finding it difficult to deal with the pressure, from his family, to provide for his soon-to-be bride.\nFor a refresher on this topic, listen to my How to Drop Your Story Coaches Corner.

"description":"Have you ever had a massive, gut-wrenching, devastating, traumatic breakup that ended a relationship before you wanted the relationship to end? Did you follow it up by an all-consuming expectation hangover? If you are a human being, chances are you have. \nMost people  have at least one issue-based relationship. They attract people who trigger unresolved issues from their past. They value being in a relationship more than they value the lessons of the relationship and repeat the pattern over and over again. They treat being single like a disease, which needs to be cured immediately.\nRelationships are an opportunity for us to grow. To find out a little more about whom we really are. When we consider how we feel about what we do instead of just the doing, we have a clearer picture of the qualities we embody.\nIf a relationship ended before you wanted it to, consider it a rite of passage. Embrace your feelings about it and then put a time limit on your heartbreak. Your heart can hurt but it should be full of unconditional love for yourself. Start falling back in love, but with yourself. Be kind and use your creativity as a channel of expression and healing.\nToday's conversation is with Monika who dares to dream and love in a big way. She moved to a foreign country and a 3 month trip turned into a 2 year stay after falling in love. The relationship ended in betrayal. Feeling her trust is forever broken, she has decided to toughen her heart and use the breakup as an excuse not to move forward with her life.\nRemember on Saturdays I release my new Coaches Corner episodes. This week will be on \"5 Tips for Getting Over a Breakup\". And if you want to hear about my history on the subject of love, you can listen to my first Over and On with It podcast.\n \nConsider/Ask Yourself: \n\nHave you given yourself the diagnosis of heartbroken and feel completely stuck?\nDid you set a relationship goal that wasn't realized and now you have an expectation hangover?\nDo you value a relationship by how long it lasts? So if it ends, do you feel you failed in some way?\nIs it easy to answer the question \"Who are you?\" with positive responses?\nCan you honestly say you feel love for yourself?\n\n \nMonika's Question: \nMonika went through an intense breakup in a foreign country. She feels her trust was crushed; she is now paralyzed by fear and is scared to take the next step forward in her life.\n \nMonika's Key Insights and Aha's:\n\nShe's a people pleaser\nShe doesn't value herself\nShe attaches her self-worth to achievement\nHer self-criticism is a habit\n\n \nHow to get over it and on with it: \n\nTrust herself and treat herself like the valuable woman she is\nRe-direct her thoughts into her improvement\nImprove her relationship with herself\nGo deeper into her spiritual practice\nDo things to make her feel alive and connected\nShe should paint an image of trust\n\n \nTools and Takeaways: \n\nFocus on how you want to feel about a result rather than the outcome itself\nWrite a list of who you are and use it to fall in love with yourself\nStart a 40-day practice or discipline to put down your defenses\nUse your creativity as a channel of expression and healing\n\n \nResources:\nChristine Hassler \nExpectation Hangover \n@christinhassler on twitter\n@christinehassler on Instagram\nchristine@christinehassler.com", "title":"22: Get Over Your Breakup and On with Your Life!", "release_date_label":"Released"};</script>
