        <td colspan="2"><p><br> <strong>I have been a certified Inner Bonding facilitator since 2009, working 1:1 by phone and Skype, </strong>specializing in deep 1:1 work with clients from around the world who are thoughtful, creative, and sensitive, and who struggle with anxiety.<br><br> <strong>That&#x2019;s how I started doing inner work myself: trying to cope with anxiety in my career as a professional oboist.</strong> I wanted to move up in the orchestra world, but no matter what I tried<strong>&#x2014;</strong>Alexander Technique, therapy, self-hypnosis, visualization&#x2014;I&#x2019;d get so nervous in auditions, I could barely breathe. It was heartbreakingly disappointing.<br><br> <strong>When I committed to the regular practice of exercise, yoga, and Zen meditation, I began to see some improvement in the anxiety.</strong> I also completed over 500 hours of training in Nonviolent Communication, which greatly increased my compassion for myself and others and helped me see the key importance of self-responsibility.<br><br> <strong>But the biggest change came when</strong> <strong>I discovered Inner Bonding. </strong>I finally realized I had been trying to control my playing&#x2014;an impossible task. With Inner Bonding, I learned how to let Spirit flow through me when I played. What a difference! The sense of joy and mastery is hard to describe. The moment I experienced this, I wanted more.<br><br> <strong>I found myself asking, &#x201c;How can I bring this kind of joy and flow into the rest of my life? And how can I help my clients do that too?&#x201d; </strong>A difficult divorce was pushing me to my limits. I saw firsthand how challenging it is to stay connected to your Loving Adult and to your spiritual guidance when your toughest issues are &#x201c;up.&#x201d;<br><br> <strong>This may sound familiar to you: when you are really up against it, something prevents you from getting through the six steps on your own.</strong> This can be incredibly frustrating, because you know very well how powerful Inner Bonding is! And you crave that wonderful feeling of peace, relief, and joy you get when you successfully complete the process.<br><br> <strong>But I have good news: you&#x2019;re not alone, and being confused or stuck in the process doesn&#x2019;t mean you are doing something wrong</strong>. On the contrary! It means you are poised for a leap in growth. Your toughest issues are tough precisely because you haven&#x2019;t yet figured out how to stay in your Loving Adult in the face of this level of pain.<br><br> <strong>When you hit your learning edge like this, you need personalized, compassionate support. And you need new skills.</strong> I&#x2019;ve experimented for years to bring you the best of both, including completing a second two-year certification in 2013 in Inner Relationship Focusing, which emphasizes radical acceptance and presence. One client who recently completed my most in-depth program, the 1:1 six-month Inner Listening Intensive, described it this way:<br><br> "My experience with Emily was truly life changing. Prior to working with her, I was an anxious and unhappy mess, and I did not understand why. I did not know how to take responsibility for my own feelings and as a result felt completely out of control and out of touch with myself. Emily helped me to discover and access my own truth."<br><br> <strong>I&#x2019;ve created a unique introductory program, the </strong><a href="http://www.luminoslistening.com/services/inner-bonders-guide/"><strong>Inner Bonder&#x2019;s Travel Guide</strong></a><strong>, designed to give you essential skills and support for your &#x201c;learning edge&#x201d; situations, in just three affordable 1:1 sessions.</strong> Please visit my website at <a href="http://www.luminoslistening.com"><strong>www.luminoslistening.com</strong></a><strong>, t</strong>o learn more about the program, read what clients are saying, and schedule a complimentary 20-minute phone consultation. You can also sign up for my e-zine, <strong><u>The Listening Post</u></strong>, and register for free teleseminars, also listed on the Inner Bonding Events page.<br><br> <strong>I look forward to hearing from you!</strong></p><br> </td>

It was a very deep experience. I learned so much having the privilege to see the miracle of healing through the presence of Truth and Love! I was very impressed by Margaret and also by the power of the Inner Bonding Process!<br><br> My wish is to be able to have the spiritual strength and connection that Margaret has and I know I need to strengthen my spiritual work every day and the Inner Bonding practice is a way to achieve it. It also gives a powerful sense of responsibility and a way to heal the ego false beliefs.<br><br> At present I offer my services as a therapist and coach in Barcelona, Spain.

        <td colspan="2"><p><br> I believe - and have personally experienced - that psychological freedom is possible when we are willing to do the work to attain it. Step-by-step we can open to being responsible for our feelings and the thoughts we allow to create our experience of life. We have the power to work with the wisest and most loving parts of ourselves to heal our misunderstandings &#x2013; especially our unforgiving and undervaluing view of ourselves - and learn to be kind to our entire being and champion our Essence &#x2013; inside ourselves as well as out in the world.<br><br> Before I found Inner Bonding, I was &#x2013; there&#x2019;s no other way to put this - deeply self-loathing. I had an Inner Critic at the level of Sniper/Assassin, who was incredibly judgmental, demanding and unforgiving. It was hyper vigilant, convinced that it had to protect me from making mistakes and getting hurt. No matter what I accomplished in the outside world, that wounded part of me would not give me any room to breathe or any kindness.<br><br> Thank goodness I found Inner Bonding. My family and friends have witnessed the growth and healing I&#x2019;ve been blessed to receive through working whole-heartedly with this technique for 8 years. The circumstances of my life and my inner experience have shifted dramatically. I (and everyone who knows me) can affirm that miracles have occurred in my life and that I operate very differently than I did in the past. &nbsp;I&#x2019;m unboundedly grateful for the efficacy of Inner Bonding and it is my true honor to support others along this path of self-growth and freedom.<br><br> In addition to practicing Inner Bonding for 8 years, attending intensives and workshops with Dr. Margaret Paul, assisting Dr. Paul at 5-Day Intensives, and working with clients for 5 years, I also have a Master&#x2019;s Degree in Spiritual Psychology from the University of Santa Monica. With this training, I have learned that there is a foundation of truth, wisdom, generosity, grace, unconditional love and complete support inside of us.&nbsp; This part of us is available to help us express our gifts, take good care of ourselves, have healthy boundaries with others, and experience an abundance of joy and gratitude in our lives.&nbsp; Most of all, this consciousness knows who we are, treasures us, and helps us to grow through all our experiences.<br><br> I believe that the best facilitators are those who have done their own healing work, are familiar with the depth and pain of the path, and have transcended their wounded selves to such a level that they experience joy and freedom on a consistent basis and can journey with you through your own healing &#x2013; no matter how daunting. I hold you in respect and caring along the way, while offering powerful insights that can provide you with quantum leaps along your healing path.<br><br> I&#x2019;ve been told that my facilitation is patient, supportive of the client&#x2019;s sacred connection with their own nurturing Guidance, respectful, gentle and caring, and particularly comforting to Highly Sensitive People.&nbsp; I see clients in person in Denver, Colorado, but am also available for Skype, Vsee, and phone sessions. I offer a free 15 minute consultation to help determine if we might work well together.<br><br> <a href="mailto:stelfine@yahoo.com">stelfine@yahoo.com</a><br><br> &nbsp;</p><br> </td>

        <td colspan="2">In 2001 I watched my already shaky marriage to an alcoholic crumble within moments of discovering a shocking secret. Such betrayal, how could this be?&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a family, owned and operated a business together, shared a ton of friends, my entire life revolved around him! My life seemed as though it was careening out of control---right along with his.&nbsp; I was depressed, had panic attacks, and was a&nbsp; total insomniac. I felt abandoned, unloved, unlovable and alone.<br><br> I kept searching, reading, attending workshops, anything to relieve the pain.&nbsp; When a friend mailed me a copy of Margaret&#x2019;s &#x201c;Do I have To Give Up Me To be Loved By God?&#x201d;&nbsp; explaining how this book and the 6 step process had been life changing for her---and I could see that it was---I dedicated myself to working the same steps and in time it was for me as well.&nbsp; Just as I searched for the light at the end of the tunnel, it appeared not as a freight train as I had feared, but as a process called Inner Bonding. I found that by working the process of Inner Bonding, eventually my inner child began to feel loved (a love no one could ever take away again) and she no longer felt abandoned. Through dedication to this process, I was able to build confidence and peace in areas of my life that had been so illusive to my endeavors to heal before.&nbsp; I began to experience&nbsp; amazing inner strength, more joy and a passion for life. I built stronger, healthier relationships and my career flourished.&nbsp; Eventually, as I continued to heal, my life&#x2019;s purpose became evident. To help others heal and gain empowerment&nbsp; from the challenges of their lives.<br><br> After nearly 7 years of training, practicing the 6 steps, attending many Inner Bonding intensives,&nbsp; working with Margaret Paul individually and learning other complimentary modalities such as N.L.P, (I am a certified NLP Coach) Tapping and Life Coaching, I am excited and honored to be helping folks gently advance in their process of healing and self discovery. I now work with clients from both the USA and Australia.<br><br> I am currently available to support others on their journey both in person as well as in phone sessions.

        <td colspan="2"><p><br> Simply put, Inner Bonding is liberation. Not that you'll never feel fear, or loneliness, not that you won't have challenges and heaps of learning opportunities...but life shifts from being a burden to be endured to an adventure to be embraced; we R-E-L-A-X.&nbsp; Believe me, I've been on both sides and if I can do it, so can you.&nbsp; For me, IB represents a pivotal link in my personal and professional quest for the last 25 years -- it has helped cultivate a palpable faith that I'm exactly where I need to be...gratitude is a beautiful thing.<br><br> Like many of us, I was led to Inner Bonding by a rather circuitous route.&nbsp; While I had developed a disciplined meditation practice which was a cornerstone of my self-care and spiritual practice, Inner Bonding helped shift my consciousness to a whole other level.&nbsp; In 2002, I was looking for the next step, and as is so often the case when we can allow it, the teacher appears when the student is ready, and I read about Inner Bonding and Margaret's retreat weekend and immediately signed up and began working the six steps.&nbsp; Now, so many years later, it remains my personal and professional capstone...the process I rely on that brings an authentic aliveness not of this world...this stuff works.&nbsp; If you are getting stuck, as many of us do when first practicing IB, and are not sure where you're going off-course, or if you're hitting something big (trauma) that you intuitively feel it would be best not to navigate by yourself, we facilitators can help. &nbsp;<br><br> I&#x2019;m a licensed holistic psychotherapist with offices in New York, NY (Chelsea), and my services are reimbursable via your health insurance for in-person sessions.&nbsp; In addition to being a Certified IB Facilitator, I love working with couples and singles on relationship issues and am a Certified EFT Therapist (Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy) with Dr. Sue Johnson (which aligns perfectly with IB) and have trained directly with Dr. John Gottman in Gottman Method Couples Therapy in Seattle. I&#x2019;m also an AASECT Certified Sex Therapist so can responsibly address all sexual issues when needed.&nbsp; I'm also trained in EMDR (Levels I, II, and III) with Dr. Laurel Parnell, a powerful modality in releasing traumatic material from the nervous system, and hold a Certification in Creative Arts Therapy and Performance Wellness from the New School for Social Research -- I really enjoy working with people intrigued by their creativity (and by the way, we are ALL creative!).&nbsp; I also have much experience working with the LGBT population, a community dear to my heart. &nbsp;<br><br> We're all on this journey together and I consider it an honor to assist others in this process of embracing and re-claiming all of who they are. I am available for in-person, Skype, and phone sessions and will provide a 15-minute consultation at no charge to discuss what you're looking to address in more detail.&nbsp; For more about my journey and work please see my website <a href="http://www.fulfilledcouples.com">www.fulfilledcouples.com</a>.</p><br> </td>

I have read many books for my own personal path of healing as well as part of my graduate work. When I read this book, I knew this was groundbreaking for me. I had never contacted an author personally before, but I felt compelled to tell her how excited and how moved I was by her book. I received a prompt loving response from her inviting me to join this amazing, loving community. After studying countless theories and approaches and years of my own personal therapy and growth, I was thrilled to find a practice that brought everything I had ever found meaningful together in one cohesive package. Drawing from the wisdom of spirituality and psychology, Inner Bonding helps us to discover our precious inner child, full of creativity and joy who is just waiting for our love and devotion. I am a big believer in the power of teaching the processes I have found to be personally effective for me. I approach therapy in the spirit of collaboration as a fellow traveler rather than from a position as an expert or an authority. By providing a safe space within the context of a healing relationship, I help clients explore where they get stuck with curiosity and compassion. My style is both sensitive and direct. I support my clients by helping them authentically align with their true selves in the midst of facing challenging situations, releasing long-standing false beliefs, or simply connecting with their own inner experience.<br><br> Kim Morrow Taff, EdS, LPC, holds a Master of Science and a Specialist degree in Professional Counseling from Georgia State University.

--><br> <p><br> I found Inner Bonding quite synchronistically back in the spring of 2003 and attended my first intensive that summer. From the minute I watched Margaret work with the first person and saw how quickly IB went to the depth of a persons soul, I knew I had found something really special and that this was for me. I realized during that intensive that a 5-day process of Inner Bonding did for me what 10 years of therapy didn't. I began working this process with Margaret very intensely and noticed incredible changes in my life. My search for internal happiness seemed to be a never-ending journey until I found this 6-step process. I really was able to start finding that happiness which I spent years searching for in this 6-step process. The layers of my wounded self started peeling away leaving me space to find my core essence and really live peacefully in it. I've handled life better and my relationships have become more real and connected as I connected to my core essence and my guidance and most importantly I have learned to share love. IB has taken me though some really tough transitions in my life and I am so grateful for this process.<br><br> I'm a High School health teacher for 11th grade and immediately came home and started teaching Inner Bonding to my students. Believe it not they embraced it really well and I started to see a way that I could really help them become happier and more productive in their lives as well as more peaceful in their skins especially during years than can be so difficult and stressful for them. I incorporated Inner Bonding into a 3-day retreat I take my students on and saw miracles happen. I'm convinced the younger this process is taught the happier our children will be.<br><br> With that said it is now time that I am interested in giving back to the Inner Bonding community and to others as well what I have been so genuinely blessed to find through the Inner Bonding process. I have been a High School Health teacher for 30 years and have taught about self-esteem and addiction. I'm a Master Practioner of Neuro Linguistic programming, Time Line Therapy, Hypnotherapy and have a certificate for Addictions Counseling. I'm certified in Reiki and a Kripalu Yoga teacher as well and am so very excited to now join the ranks of Inner Bonding Facilitators in training. If interested in working with me you can reach me at 516-527-5371 or e-mail me at merryooo@msn.com. I look forward to working with you!</p><br> <p class="MsoNormal"><br>

Not knowing what would help seemed the bigger problem.&nbsp; Learning the 6 steps of Inner Bonding allowed me to learn about the wounds that prevented me from experiencing compassion (not self-pity) on an inner level.&nbsp; This process, which includes the foundation of a spiritual connection, helped me put heart, soul, mind, and body together and granted me a practical means to grow and heal. Inner Bonding has taught me to follow and live in a new understanding of God&#x2019;s love, from the inside out.<br><br> My training and career has been as a social worker, minister, and professor. I experience my deepest joy when I see persons, groups and communities experience God&#x2019;s unconditional Love.&nbsp; I love to see the miracles that happen when someone, in the intent to learn, attends to their own fears and hurts in such a loving way as to find healing and hope.&nbsp; Such healing is compelling and contagious.

With Inner Bonding, she learned to love and re-parent herself and create the life she always wanted.<p>Having experienced transformation, she was drawn to helping others heal. She earned a Bachelor&#x2019;s Degree in Social Work from Azusa Pacific University, a Master&#x2019;s Degree in Social Welfare at UCLA, and became a certified spiritual counselor with the Association for the Integration of the Whole Person. For over 15 years, she has shared the power of Inner Bonding through social work in hospital, adoption and foster care settings, as well as, with children/families in the elementary schools using play/art therapy and training others in these processes. </p><p>She continues to provide Inner Bonding support with individuals, children and families, serving as a &#x201c;midwife to the healing process&#x201d;; gently guiding clients through an inherently intuitive exploration to nurture loving and compassionate connection within, with God and with others.<strong> She also facilitates a deeply nurturing and supportive monthly Inner Bonding Support group in Fullerton, CA. &nbsp;</strong><a style="color: #5a887e" href="http://www.connectingwithin.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/xmas-2008.jpg"></a></p><p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p><p><a style="color: #5a887e" href="http://www.connectingwithin.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/xmas-2008.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin-top: 1em; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; border-width: 1px; border-color: #3b3434; border-style: solid" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-135" src="http://www.connectingwithin.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/xmas-2008-300x199.jpg" alt="" title="xmas 2008" width="300" height="199"></a></p><p>Having been inspired by her own amazing and challenging experiences of pregnancy, birth and motherhood, she also developed a focus on supporting mothers.

As parents of a two year old with another on the way, we have discovered that the Inner Bonding process offers us a wonderful way to have a honest and loving relationship with our son, in addition to providing him with the necessary tools to help him develop into a joyous, grounded well- adjusted young adult.<br><br> We have incorporated the inner bonding process into our daily lives and we are thankful for the gifts it has given us.

I am eager to teach parents an alternative way of communicating with their children through Inner Bonding.<br><br> When I had my son I was an overwhelmed, frightened parent. I wanted so desperately to do everything right. Between the pressure I was putting myself under and the lack of tools to do so, I became paralyzed and depressed. Once I began to use the Inner Bonding <br><br> I felt a tremendous shift from helplessness to hopefulness. I knew I could do this and be successful at it. My son and I now have a wonderful way of communicating that is warm and loving. I never have to resort to the more aggressive techniques that so many parents have to use out of lack of a better alternative. I assume if I went through these feelings and challenges so must every new parent.

The studio is in Cadiz, southern Spain, where I live.<br><br> My mother died when I was 3 years old and 7 years later my father died. I was raised by my older siblings and family. Because everybody around me was so wounded I was provided with everything material but most of my emotional needs were unmet. I always felt a deep loneliness, so deep that I wasn't even aware of it.<br><br> In 1995, after a crisis in a personal relationship, I realized that I was missing something out of life. I started looking and researching. I did therapy, went to seminars, read tons of books. One of the books was Healing Your Aloneness. Somehow It clicked inside of me. A couple of years later the book was still lingering in my head. I tried to contact Margie through friends in the states but it was impossible. in January year 2000 during a short vacation in the USA I just called information service asked for Margie's phone number. They gave it to me, I called and Margie answered!. She told me about Inner Bonding and the intensives. I decided to make the effort because even if I have to sell my car or spend all my savings I owe it to myself. I went to my first intensive in May that year and since then I have healed so much that had you told me before I wouldn't believe you - no way! And I even have a much, much better car!<br><br> While still in my healing journey I decided to commit part of my time and energy to make INNER BONDING available to more people, especially to the people in Spain and Spanish speaking people.

My spiritual teacher presented Inner Bonding me at a retreat, to which I had gone to be able to become a mother after not having been able to for a while. The effect of Inner Bonding, in the context of new spiritual practices such as meditations and decrees, was immediate and one month later I was pregnant with my first daughter.<br><br> I continued my healing process and after having my baby decided to change career paths.

This enables them to know their True Self and be able to manifest this in their daily lives, brining wellness to themselves and others. &#x2028;&#x2028;<br><br> My work is based on conversations as a life coach, using healing practices such as: guided meditations to connect to the Universal Source of knowledge, love and power (God for me); Touch for Health, which is applied kinesiology to connect with the body´s message from the soul, thru balancing energy meridians, and others such as EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), Energy Healing of Chakras and Vortices and Angel´s Therapy.<br><br> I am now training myself to become an Inner Bonding facilitator, a dream I have had for a couple of years and now is coming a reality. I am grateful to all the people, Margaret especially who is so kind and loving, who have helped create and offer Inner Bonding to the world.<br><br> If you need any assistance in your spiritual journey or are looking to feel better with yourself or your life in any way, do not hesitate to contact me and, God willing, I will be ready to assist you.

        <td colspan="2"><p><br> <strong><u>About Irena Grgona</u></strong><br><br> <strong>About me</strong><br><br> I was born in France with Serbian/Croatian roots. I moved to England at 19 on a scholarship to study Business and Languages where I have remained. Business was followed by performing arts and finally psychology. As an artist, I started dancing at age 9 and toured semi-professionally, then trained in the Meisner acting technique in London and New York city. As an academic, I hold a French undergraduate degree (Licence, in Applied Modern Languages), &nbsp;a British BA(Hons) in Business Studies and German and currently finishing my post-graduate MSc in Psychology. I worked as a speech writer for Ministers, in advertising and market research, and have spent the last 10 years in the City financial district in London working in global corporate firms. I studied Inner Bonding&nbsp; in parallel to psychology and the Inner Bonding Facilitator training programme.<br><br> <strong>About Facilitation and Innerbonding</strong><br><br> I came across Inner Bonding (IB) by chance in 2010 by searching for help on google. &nbsp;At the time I was struggling in my personal and professional life and happiness eluded me. I also had an unhealthy relationship with food. Drs Paul &#x2018;s and Chopich&#x2019;s method had an immediate impact on my life and today it has truly transformed. After devoting most of the last six years on healing and researching this subject academically, I have come to the conclusion that it is not possible to fully heal and recover without a spiritual connection. This is why I am passionate and fully committed to IB as a way of reclaiming our mental and spiritual health, reconnecting with our source of love and with ourselves. Because of my personal heritage and particular ancestral wounding (in part due to war traumas), my own neurological and psychological development evolved in such a way whereby I had a fractured sense of self which I needed to reclaim and became vulnerable to narcissists. I was able to heal these unhealthy attachments and have researched this area in depth. If you yourself have suffered trauma and been in relationships with narcissists (and might still experience difficulties healing this attachment) I can help you.<br><br> My style is warm and direct whilst I guide you on your journey to go beneath the surface, whilst &#x201c;compassionately and unconditionally holding you and the space for you&#x201d; during our sessions together. I am also inspired by different modalities and schools of thoughts (from movement and Arts therapy, to Tibetan Buddhism and meditation, Christianity, Rogerian compassionate and unconditional acceptance, the 12 steps, and the deeply healing forms of prayer). I speak six languages (and have carried out Inner Bonding in French and Serbian), have a good understanding of neuroscience, biological psychology and spirituality which have been invaluable in my guiding and helping myself and my clients.<br><br> It is this joint experience of learning to dig deep within myself as an artist first, then as a psychologist/academic and corporate worker, which has given me a unique perspective on healing holistically. My own journey has enabled me to help clients from a wide variety of backgrounds to self-heal, manifest their true self and unearth their unique gifts and talents. My healing approach is firmly rooted in practicing the 6 steps of IB. Working with moral responsibility and serving others is not mutually exclusive with being commercial and profitable.<br><br> I enjoy hiking, dancing, traveling,&nbsp; the Arts, music and spending time in nature, with family and friends. I am available by phone, skype and in person in London: <a href="mailto:irena1mia@hotmail.com">irena1mia@hotmail.com</a>. I look forward to working with you.<br><br> <strong>Client testimonials</strong><br><br> I am very glad that I have found Irena and have the opportunity to work with her.

I cannot recommend Irena as a mentor enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Lucy, Actress &amp; cranio-sacral therapy therapist, London, UK</strong><br><br> Irena has helped me a great deal with talking through and understanding my addictive personality and coming to terms with the aftermath of a mentally abusive relationship with someone that is Narcissistic. She is extremely approachable, kind and incredibly knowledgeable in her field.<strong> Faye , Actress/stand-up comic and writer, London, UK</strong><br><br> Thank you so much for the sessions we have had.&nbsp; They have made a real difference in my life.&nbsp; I am dealing with things today differently, knowing that each moment is a choice if I go into stress and overwhelm.&nbsp; Your warmth, understanding and being seen has been very impactful and I want to sincerely thank you for that.<strong> Lulu, Financial Director, Brisbane, Australia</strong><br><br> Even though I only had a few sessions with Irena, I can honestly say that so far this has been the best investment I made on my health and wellbeing. I cannot thank her enough for all the help she is giving me and for all the astonishing progress I have already made.<strong> Federica, Investment Management professional, London, UK</strong><br><br> Depuis que j&#x2019;ai commencé à travailler avec Irena j&#x2019;ai change les mauvaises habitudes que j&#x2019;avais depuis des années alors que je pensais qu&#x2019;elles faisaient parties de moi.

My first Inner Bonding Intensive helped me uncover childhood issues, which went unresolved for years despite considerable effort with other therapies. Once I committed to Inner Bonding, I progressed quickly. Through my individual and group sessions with Dr. Margaret Paul, I exited the victim state, became responsible for my Inner Child, and I began to heal. I developed the strength to advocate for my son&#x2019;s therapies. I found the courage to leave a difficult marriage. And I discovered true intimacy and love for myself and for another, entering into a most positive, new marriage. I also created a career that is of service to the world, with the additional benefit of being financially lucrative. As Dr. Margaret says, &#x201c;Doing what was in my highest good was ultimately in the good of others. &#x201c;<br><br> <strong>Inner Bonding gave me the tools I needed to re-create myself Emotionally, Spiritually, and Financially.</strong> Today I am regarded as an internationally recognized expert on the use of theater arts for transformation.
