                <b>Deepika:</b> I would like to know what "Rudra Abhishek Pooja" is all about? How to perform this pooja? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> In Vedas Rudra word is used for God, soul and air as also mentioned in Rig-Veda mantra 1/ 43/1. As regards Rudra Abhishek Pooja it is not mentioned in Vedas please. Vedas state worship only one formless Almighty, omnipresent God who has unlimited qualities and creates, nurses and destroy the universe. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Atul Dighe:</b> Do People Dying During Pitr Paksh are freed from the cycle of Birth and Death and attain Moksh? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No please, moksh has no concern with any paksh. It has concern with pious deeds according to Vedas, shastras, holy books and moksh is attained while a Yogi is alive and not during death or after death.

                <br>
                <b>Tara Ramjit:</b> Is repairing house during pitri pask wrong? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> To repair the house in any paksh or to do any pious deeds is not wrong please. One should perform only havan daily with Ved mantras. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Dr. Premanidhi Panda:</b> Do tantra and mantra help in success? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Mantras, tantras are nothing. Yes one must listen Ved mantras and do havan daily. Your hard working with full concentration and devotion will sure do the needful, please. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Jatindar Paul:</b>Is there a easier way to Sunn Samadhi? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No please. One has to listen Vedas, must do daily havan, must be always be in contact with learned Acharya and must do hard practice of Ashtang yoga for the purpose. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Nikita:</b> What is the significance of ghat sthapana in navaratre and what is the procedure for it? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Such sthapana etc., is not mentioned in Vedas please. Vedas state worship only one formless Almighty, omnipresent God who has unlimited qualities and creates, nurses and destroy the universe. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Naveen:</b> You have mentioned 21 herbs for havan to get best results. Would you please mention names of these herbs/or provide me in reply email? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> KASTURI, KESAR, AGAR-TAGAR, CHANDAN, JATAMANSI, ELAYCHI, JAYFAL, JAVITRI, GOOGAL, NAGARMOTHA, BALCHHAD, SUGANDHBALA, DALCHINI, JAU, GILOYA, CHUARA, BADAM, AKHROT, BANAKSHA, GUD, AND KISHMISH. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>A. K. Tiwari:</b> Can prarabdh and the griha karam be changed by performing atishaya jaap? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> PRARABHADH AND SANCHIT KARMA can be burnt by the method that one must try to listen the preach of Vedas daily or as more as possible. Then the preach must be followed strictly. Daily havan/Yagya, regular contact with learned Acharya etc., will sure do the needful please. Yes, daily practice of yoga philosophy is also essential. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Shubhra Narang:</b> hum havana kaise kare,asaan sa tareika batane mei madad kare
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Your views are highly appreciated as havan is the worship of God as well as purifies the atmosphere. you can read my book on havan please, If possible, which can be sent on receipt of your postal address. In the book you'll read several good qualities of havan, including how to perform the havan with Ved mantras. It is a worship of God which is performed daily both times as per Saamveda mantra 14 too. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S C:</b> Is human is superior creature of God? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes please. Human body is the best creation of the God. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S C:</b> Shudras are also humans. Then why dharmashasthras and Manu recommend things against them? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> It has never been mentioned by Manusmriti. The eternal knowledge of Vedas which emanates direct from God also do not tells such statement (quoting certain slokas from Manu Smriti) 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Manu bhagwan was philosopher of Vedas. He could not think against the Vedas. It has been a conclusion of learned that such shlokas have been added afterwards. The following shlok have been added afterwards, from 279 to 285, 412 to 418 (chapter 8), from shlok 11/1 to 43, 11/126 to 138, have been added afterwards. So the shlokas are false. As regards shlok 9/151, please study from shlok 138 to 151 then please send your question. All above are false and have been added afterwards. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S C:</b> If any one desire to learn Vedas then you recommend them that first you study about the book which was I written or a true yogi written. Then you come to learn to Vedas. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> It depends at one's own wish. It is not compulsory. However, the books written by any present learned assists the aspirant to understand Vedic philosophy easily. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Purushotham:</b> How many times a mantra should be chanted to get it's effects? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> One must chant ved mantra both times daily and affects is always awarded by God. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Deepak Chainanai:</b> What is deeksha? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Now a days mostly the saints and the people are not studying the eternal knowledge of God given in the shape of our Vedas. It has resulted to spread false meanings of divine Vedic words/mantras. So is the case of Divine word, "DEEKSHA", mostly everybody says that if name of God, whatever it may be (i.e., may be against the Vedas), is told by any Guru to his disciple then it means the disciple has been given DEEKSHA, which is actually against the Vedas. Now let's see the Yajurveda mantra 19/30, "VRATEN DEEKSHAAM AAPNOTI", 
                <br> VRATEN = to adopt Brahmacharya and true speech etc., 
                <br> DEEKSHAAM= Brahmacharya, the education/knowledge from Vedas, good education, 
                <br> AAPNOTI= are obtained. 
                <br>
                <br> So the meaning of DEEKSHA is clear that DEEKSHA is obtained by adopting Brahmacharya and observing truth, by speech, listening, holding in heart, etc. 
                <br>
                <br> DEEKSHA i.e., the education of Brahmacharya and knowledge from Vedas/yoga philosophy etc., is obtained from an Acharya (learned of Vedas) by following the path of VRAT (VRATEN), i.e., to adopt Brahmacharya and true speech etc., as mentioned above. 
                <br>
                <br> Atharvaveda mantra 19/43/1 also throws light on the pious word DEEKSHA as under-----
                <br>
                <br> DEEKSHA = to observe Vedic rules, Brahmacharya, good education. The idea of whole mantra is---
                <br>
                <br> O! God please take ME TO THE PIOUS Place Where Yogi, who has realized God and knows Vedas philosophy, resides, adopting DEEKSHA (as stated above) and TAPSA SAH = along with Tap, i.e., study of Vedas, control on five perceptions, five sense organs, and mind. 
                <br>
                <br> Idea---- if an aspirant will reach the Above quoted place of a Yogi/brahamgyani, definitely he will realize God and get salvation. When people will be able to understand the said truth of the immortal Vedas then automatically beware of false prophets. The problem is only that the Bharatvarsh who was VISHWAGURU on the basis of Vedic culture has lost the knowledge of Vedas and hence illusion. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Deepak Chainani:</b> I was asking devi devtas beej mantras. Can I do with gaytri mantra? I was asking as Muslims and another casts are successful they don’t do havan and gaytri mantra. Success I was talking all kind of success. Is it not true that America is number one in power money, etc. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Gayatri mantra is mentioned in three Vedas, so Gayatri mantra is the best. You can see its meaning on this web site, please. Is the power of America in arms and ammunition along with money can ever be compared with the power of king Harishchandra, Dashrath, Shri Ram, etc. Do you accept the culture of USA. Ravana, Duryodhan, Aurangzeb, Napoleon, Sikander, were also powerful, but were they got peace as the peace was attained by our ancient Raj rishis. Is it fair to compare spiritualism/truth with power, money etc.? Duryodhan got many times more power of Army duly compared with Panadvas, but was badly defeated. So was the case of Shri Ram and Ravana war. Is any the richest person on the earth has got permanent peace at present even? Yes, protection of country is first motto, but it must always along with spiritualism and culture. USA, no doubt is a great country, because their citizens have nationality. Law and order are also better. But our culture is quiet different. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Abhishek:</b> What is the Meaning of my name? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Meaning is --- sprinkling, royal function, inauguration, etc. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vibhor:</b> If this birth is the result of the action or karmas of my last birth then what action or karmas I had done by which I had taken my first birth. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The present birth is not only based on the deeds of the last birth. Present birth is based on the deeds of several previous births. The bunch of such deeds of unlimited births is called sanchit karam. And the present birth is based on sanchit karam. Secondly, soul is immortal, so the births are eternal and unlimited. If possible, please study my detailed description on Yoga Shastra sutras wherein the philosophy of karmas and births is also mentioned. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Rajat Duggal:</b> We do good with some people and they misuse and reuse against us. What should I do with these people? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> One must do worship daily. Please try to listen preach of Vedas, even you can study the whole web site or spiritual books written by me. The conclusion on the matter of co-operation or help is, one should always do help or do pious deeds without targeting the result thereof. Secondly one should always avoid the bad society or the people who are selfish and thankless. But one should never hate anybody. 
                <br>
                <br>

She plays several important rolls in a family such as mother, wife, relatives, etc; she is considered as Lakshmi (Harmony), Saraswati (Knowledge), Parvati (Power) and Shakti (Universal Energy). In Law Book of MANU (MANU SMRITI), we find so many tender and kind remarks are addressed to women; it shows a way of being polite to women. Great example such MAITREYI, GARGI, ANASUYA, ARUNDHATI, SAVITRI, SITA MATA. All human character during Vedic period seems very strong and noble.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> SHRAT= truth, DHA= to hold. So shrdha means to hold the truth within an aspirant. Truth is God and the knowledge of Vedas emanates direct from God in the shape of four Vedas. So to listen, observe, hold and follow the path of Vedas means aspirant is following true path and he is shrdhwaan. Tribute is worldly custom whereas shradha is spiritualism.

Aren't we depriving the calf of its rightful milk? What about egg?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The milk of cow is vegetarian as the milk of the mother to a baby is vegetarian. In all Vedas, God has instructed to take the milk. So it is very fully vegetarian. On the other hand God has strictly prohibited any kind of meat. As regards calf, the some portion of the milk of cow is to be given and not full. Yes egg is also prohibited. We have to follow the orders of God mentioned in Vedas and not orders of man. 
                <br>

                <b>Baldev:</b> I impressed by you, after reading some of answers, which are quite upto mark and knowledgeable. I used to listen about from childhood about Vedas, Mahabhart, Ram Chander ji, etc. But I got confused about numbers of Devi Devtas of Hindu, to whom we warship or whom we not. I am not rigid and have flexible nature and respect every religion of world and never said or think wrong about. It is in my heart and I know on one day, I do meditation of God with whole heartily, because I do job with whole heart and with devotion. We remember the God, when He WILLS. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> I am happy to hear about you. Your views are appreciated. Nobody can know God based on the history only. Suppose we are before Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, before Mahabharta or Ramayana, so that at that ancient time who used to read such holy books. Definitely nobody. Because such dignitary did not take birth. So it is clear that at that time nobody used to know God based on the said holy books. So eternal knowledge is required to realize God and to attain salvation. At this juncture eternal Vedas states that God is formless, omnipresent, alive, omniscient, beyond imagination, creates, nurses and destroy the universe. HE WAS ONE, IS ONE and WILL EVER REMAIN ONE. There is no even equivalent to the said ONE GOD, neither born, nor will be born. We have to worship the said unchangeable Almighty God, under guidance of a learned spiritual Guru.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Religion for all human beings is to do such pious deeds according to Vedas and other holy books which give happiness, long life here in the present life as well as after death. So the deeds done by a person, which gives sorrows, tensions, diseases, problems etc., to the person and others, cannot be called a religion. This is also mentioned in Vaisheshik Shastra sutra 1 /2, i.e., "YATOBHAYUDAYANIHISHREYASSIDDHIHI SA DHARMAH", 
                <br>
                <br> MEANING--- by which ABHYUDAYA (merriment in present life) and NIHISHREYAS (salvation) are attained that is called DHARAM (religion).

You can recollect attacks on Akshardham, Varanasi, Hanuman temple and all pious places of worship by militants, which categorically points towards the tendency of ASUR only. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Not for modern time but it is eternal law in Vedas vide Yajurveda mantra 40/3 that we takes birth as man or woman. When we discharge our duties well and adopt the true religion as stated above (like worship, honesty etc., etc.) under guidance of a true learned acharya) then we attain the stage of Devta. And if a person is indulged in illusion and commits sins then he is called ASUR/RAKASHAS/demon.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> This is not the end of Shri Ram's family. The generation may be unknown but may be present now also. Valmiki ji wrote about kingdom of Dashrath only and not the much period of Shri Ram. In Uttrakand chopai number 3 under couplet 24, it is mentioned by Tulsidass ji, 
                <br> "DWI SUT SUNDER SITA JAYE, 
                <br> LUV KUSH VED PURANANAH GAYE" 
                <br>
                <br> Meaning--- Sita mata gave birth to two sons, named Luv and Kush. However Vedas never states for any name of human beings in the shape of proper noun, because Vedas are eternal and has no any story for anybody. Whole Vedas states about three vidya (education) gyan (knowledge of matter, science etc.,), karam (deeds) and upasana (worship, yagya, swadhyaya, Ashtang yoga practice etc.,). Vedas has knowledge right from straw to braham. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> Do people need the freedom to believe in any faith they want to? Is it right to impose just one book or one faith on everyone? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Knowledge is enough even in some sentences like God is immortal, formless, omnipresent, omniscient, and he is one, who creates, nurses and destroys the universe and again creates. The knowledge of the Vedas emanates direct from God. We must study Vedas. 
                <br>
                <br> Now one has to go deep on each word of the above sentences. 
                <br>
                <br> So when any individaul will study one true book definitely he will go to a learned guru who knows Vedas and ashtang yoga philosophy. So not one book, but few sentences (preach) from the said guru is enough to turn the life of an aspirant. But several books are of no use for those who gathers bookish knowledge only and want to be a guru. In this process they spread illusion only. Such gurus go in hell along with their followers as said in Manusmriti shlok 2/168.

It is not possible to say about sanskaars etc., for example there are sixteen sanskaars in Vedas the list of which has been placed on this web site.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Lack of confidence mostly becomes due to inferiority complex, to think deeply while planning etc., alone. Due to previous lives deeds effect etc., but main reason is due to lack of knowledge of spiritualism specially in the absence of education of Vedas/shastras. For example-we are body, we are soul and reside in body. The quality of soul is alive, immortal, evergreen and ever full of happiness, never become sick, never indulge in illusion etc., etc. It has ten qualities also - dhriti (patience), kshma (forgiveness), dam (control on five perceptions and five sense organs and mind), any bad thought should not come even, astey (not to steal), shauch (purity of body as well as mana, buddhi, chitt and ahankaar), indriya-nigrah (to restrain organs from doing sins), dhee (intellect- buddhi ), vidya (knowledge of Vedas), satya (to listen, to speak and to work based on truth) and akrodha (control on baseless anger). So one should attain the above said qualities. For gaining the said knowledge we have to listen Vedas. Then we should do havan daily. We must learn and do asana, pranayaam and meditation daily. This pious worship will give you a lot of mental as well as physical energy and everything then will be okay. You must awake early in the morning daily for a long morning walk and light exercises. Take at least twenty glass of water daily. The water must be boiled and then cooled. Please read newspaper and at least one magazine daily. Then discuss the newspapers matter in house as well as in the society. It will also help you a lot to overcome your problems. 
                <br>
                <br> Please try to follow. I think you'll quite alright. In addition I have written some spiritual books and can be sent to you free of cost to study. Without study of spiritualism there remains always problems in the life. So must study spiritual books at least one page thereof daily. Please also purchase Valmiki Ramayana to study. This all will give you energy. Try to do havan daily with Gayatri mantra.

Secondly when anybody will really study Vedas with yoga practice and will do havan daily his desires will be killed automatically. For example-I went to USA twice, was selected in University as a yoga professor and offered much and much money. In India also people offered and have been offering money but I never accept baselessly. I was offered to build so many ashrams in India and was offered lands also but I have denied. 
                <br>
                <br> So please try to understand the real meaning of lack of money. I do not make any slips/parchi for donation etc. Lack of money does not mean that I am a beggar and placing demand before anybody else in the world. Mostly my books and cassettes are being sent free of cost to all world or on the rate which gives loss to me. People are always around me to donate and to make cassettes to be shown on TV on their expenses but I always deny. Once a gentleman made me to agree and I made cassettes which were released on SANSKAAR channel on the cost of gentleman. And that is more then enough for me. 
                <br>
                <br> Where there is mostly false and false all around the world in my view then it looks no nice to wear BHAGWA chola, white chola or black shawl etc., to show oneself as a sadhu. The chola has now become defamed etc. Actually the soul must be wearing chola of hard study of Vedas, shastras, Upanishads, Sanskrit Grammar, hard practice of Ashtang yoga and the experience of realizing SOM (merriment Of God) and I'll advice such people to be either remain alone or sit in a cave in a jungle. Because the present saints who are against the Vedas, Yagya and Ashtang yoga practice they have trained the public to be indulged in pomp and show/decorations, and seeking enjoyment from outside, which is not a motto of a Ashtang yogi. So now a days people requires money, decoration, pomp and show, false stories, luxuries, indulging senses in to worldly article/pleasure, who needs money only, he will naturally talk on the matter of money. 
                <br>
                <br> Mostly the present saints talk that money will do nothing and gathers money from the public in bags and are spending their lives with modern luxuries etc. But really such saints according to Manusmriti shlok 2/168, have chosen the path of sorrows, problems, tensions, several diseases, etc., etc., to face along with their followers. What to talk more about money. 
                <br>
                <br> Shri Gurubanni states, 
                <br> "MAYA BHAI SAPRPANI, JINN PUJA TINN HEE KHAYO". 
                <br>
                <br> Yajurveda mantra 40/2 states, "KASYA SWIDHANAM", I.E., the money/assets etc., is of no one. So there is a question - Is this assets or even human body has become permanently of anybody else. So mantra says--- "TEN TYAKTEN BHUNJITHA", Utilize the assets/money duly detached. In the description of Patanjal Yoga Darshan sutra 4/32, Vyas Muni states that prakriti's guna (money, assets etc.,) offer money, sensual enjoyment, assets, pomp and show etc., etc., who wants the same and thus the prakriti creates sorrows/hell etc., for them and the same prakriti helps a yogi to attain salvation/realization of God, who want such realization. So humans beings are free to choose any path. 
                <br>
                <br> I think there are two types of beggars. 1. whose demands are few, i.e., thousand or lakhs etc. 2. whose requirements are crore, Arab, unlimited. But Fakir says, 
                <br> "CHAH GAI CHINTA GAI, MANVA BEPARWAH, 
                <br> JISKO KACCHU NA CHAHIYE, SO HEE SHANSHAAH." 
                <br> i.e., he is the real king in the shape of a person who is desire-less,(i.e., have no baseless desire against the Vedas). 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>SC:</b> How can we get the money or wealth by performing havan/yagya? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Havan and yagya gives only satisfaction which is the most precious donation/blessing from Almighty God. Havan/Yaj kills the desires providing with the invaluable quality of APARIGRAH. Please see Yoga Shastra sutra 2/30 and 2/39. One must do havan with desire but at last desires will be minimized and satisfaction will be there automatically being a result of worship of God in the shape of performing havan/Yaj daily with Ved mantras.

                <b>Dhanesh Padhya:</b> Swami ji Dandwat pranam! Firstly I am very thankful to you for your satisfied answer, you are very cleaned and straight minded. Namaskar once again, Guruji in one question I read on sight about Hanumanji you replied that he is not amar it is against the nature. Actually I have also heard in the Ramayana Kathaa of many learned Gujrati kathakars that Shri Hanuman ji is amar as he didn't went with Sri Ramji in Sarayu river. Guruji can you tell me that what happened to Shri Hanumanji afterwards? Also tell me please what about the end of Manthra and Surparnkha? I am asking you with eagerness please. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Thanking you please. My blessings to you. Every soul is immortal but is bounded by two types of karmas --- pious and sins and therefore to face the result of karmas in the shape of happiness and sorrows etc., respectively. Soul is provided with human body. But as per atharvaveda mantra 10/8/26 too that body will be destroyed one day but not soul and soul will take next body according to the deeds/karmas to face further. So the body of hanumaan ji does not exist now but soul is immortal. According to yajurveda mantra 3/62 nobody can attain age more than four hundred years. So i think everything is clear now in case of all above mentioned dignitaries. Fundamental laws of God are equally applicable for all who attains human/any body.

                <b>Bachan Singh:</b> Please let me know what does Mandir means. Is it mentioned somewhere in Vedas? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> In Sanskrit language mandiram/mandir means building/house/residence, etc. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Sarosh Butt:</b> Few Hindu says that Advaitvad concept is mention in the Vedas but you said that it is not mentioned. They give these mantra in this favor,"Yasmatparam na paramasti Kinchit Yasmananiyo na jyaosti kinchit. Vrikshaivastabdho divi tishtatyekastedenam poornam purushena sarvam. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> It is sholk of Shwetashwaropnishad 3/9. Its meaning: there is no other supreme like God, nor the minutest and not supreme. He is only one, and is established in the space without motion, this universe is completely filled with the God, i.e., the God is omnipresent. Now please consider that God is omnipresent. So in which matter he is omnipresent, if there is nothing except God then how he will be called omnipresent. Thus it is to be considered strictly that world and its each article made of prakriti are non -alive and always separate from God. So present advaitvad is not according to Vedas. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Sarosh Butt:</b> "Om Poornamadam poornamidam poornaat poornamudichyate. Poornasya poorna madaya poornamevavashishyate. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Please correct it. It is started from - Om purannmadah purannmidam -------------.(rest your shlok is okay) it is Brihadarnyakopnishad shlok 5/1/1 its meaning is God is perfect/full in all respects and almighty. From the God the perfect universe is created i.e., universe is also perfect in all respect. From a perfect, if perfect is removed then perfect will remain. Idea of the shlok: God is perfect. During final destrcution time, the universe is destroyed and turned into prakriti. The prakriti and all immortal souls take shelter in God according to Rigveda mandal 10. Then when creation takes place then whole universe which was turned into prakriti comes out and turned into universe. Then too God remians perfect. Second idea: God is perfect and the knowledge of the Vedas always remains with in God. At the time of creation the whole knowledge of the Vedas emanates direct from God and is originated in the heart of four rishis then too God remains perfect with the knowledge of Vedas. So the above upnishad shlok have no concern with present advaitvad, please. 
                <br>

                <b>Sarosh Butt:</b> Purusha sookta in Rig Veda. What is the meaning of this mantra please? "Sahasra sheersha Purusha Sahasraksha Sahasrapaa .." Is its mean that God has thousands of heads and legs, hose Heads of all Gods, humans and other creatures? Please explain the above mantras with reference to Adavita Concept.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Sahastrshirsha means the head of all human beings and living beings are heads of God because God is present in every head and heads have been given by God. Fundamental law of God are unchangeable. So it cannot be the meaning of Purush Sukta which is 31 chapter of Yajurveda that God has several heads. So is the case of other organs of the mantra please, like eyes etc. So it also does not have any relation with the present Advaitvad.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Ashtadhayi is written by Pannini Muni. It is a Sanskrit grammar book. This is a great benefit to the human beings by pannini muni ji. It is not 5/1/125, it is 5/2 /125, it is a sutra and can only be understand if a person has studied Sanskrit grammar. For example - its meaning is from vaach pratipadik in matvarthe, there will be aalach and aatach pratya. Next the meaning of bhaubhashini is talkitive i.e., who speaks more and more and too baselessly. So sanskrit he will be called vaachalah or vaachaatah. So in this meaning several words have been used which can be known by only a person who knows Sanskrit.

Please explain, how God will let us know about the perfect match? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Marriages are in the hand of God means we all have to face the result of our previous lives' deeds good or bad in the shape of happiness or sorrows respectively. This philosophy is also, lengthy one and needs Vedas preach to listen. If our present deeds are pious under a guidance of acharya as stated above then we become able to kill our bad deeds/sins of our previous lives', naturally then we change our luck. So if we do not pray then we face the karmas in family life according to our deeds and if we worship then we change our worship, the result of both paths is always in the hand of God. Please note that God has no hands being formless, so here symbolic language is used.

                <b>Meaning:</b> 
                <br> O! Learned acharya, you be near us and protect us by guiding pious deeds at the beautiful time of dawn, when calm light starts coming and become protective to us. While providing with the best preacher, you kindly become available to us. Because we cordially invite you with respect so teach us the pious deeds which give us merriment and remain available for us. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Idea:</b> The time of dawn is always healthy for all human beings. Its benefits are huge. So a learned acharya of Vedas is compared here with dawn. He is the learned acharya who protects us, duly provided with eternal knowledge of Vedas, separates and protects us from sins, etc., duly provided us with Vedic knowledge. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> Regarding, God, Souls, Prakriti, Universe, I am sure you are the master no doubt about it. The bhakt in me will not listen, argue, discuss anything about God, because He is eternal and is above everything like mercy and punishment etc. but for the sake of understanding, the scientist in me, which always wants to go deeper and deeper. I hope you will not mind if I write few lines. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yaskacharya's Nirukta Granth sutras 1/20 and 13/12 clearly state that discussion/arguments are hundred percent needed to come to the truth. That is why Upanishad and especially in Bhagwat Geeta there is great discussion/argument between disciple and acharya, Shri Krishna and Arjuna. As regards listening, Vedas are not book. It is a knowledge which always resides within God being eternal. At the beginning of every universe the Vedas (knowledge) emanates from God and is originated in the heart of four rishis. Yajurveda mantra 31/7 also refers. Thereafter the rishi starts preaching and normal public listens and wiser/learned of Vedas. So first of all listening of Vedas is necessary being eternal process. Then the Vedas are now a days to be studied. So i appreciate your and others questions always. The knowledge is not required to be shouldered stating religious point of view. Otherwise it will be a blind faith which is mostly in practice now a days. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> God is eternal and present everywhere, in you, in me, in earth, in plants, in trees, in elements, in oceans, in fire, in ether, in wind, in flowers, in animals, in pain, in happiness, because he is formless, tasteless, shapeless, nothing can create it or destroy it and we can find him/her deep within us, who is present as a silence (Prashant), we meditate to reach this silence which is him/her. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes please, God has unlimited qualities whereas a man is in limitations. So God is beyond description, beyond calculation and imagination and can not be observed by five senses even, he is only realized during Asampragyat Samadhi. So one has to listen from an acharya about God and the real path to realize Him (God). 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> God responds when called for and also knows everything. We don't have to explain but before all this he asks us to purify ourselves in mind (physical self follows mind) and thought. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Knowledge is attained when it is given by anybody. So we have to think how he will listen our prayers? And how he will be able to purify us? What is the real path for the same? 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> God wants us to love him/her unconditionally. We are given this body with distractions, in the form of senses, he wants us to overcome the sensual distractions and reach him in purity. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> God states in Vedas to pray and produce pious demands before 'him' to fulfill. In this way at last we start worship and one day we become desireless. And we too become able to control our senses, our mind etc. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> The puja, havans, dhyanam etc are few ways to appease him, or call him or reach him, which I think is his only desire or expectation from all the souls to whom he has given bodies or chance to take birth in this arena called earth, where we are challenged by cosmos (God) not only to overcome but also to learn or purify ourselves so that the soul can move upwards, towards him for ultimate assimilation into him, which is by means of good action and karma, based on which we will get what we deserve. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Pooja etc., is our necessity as told in Vedas. But it is not a desire of God, otherwise he could make all human beings wise within a second. As per Yajurveda mantra 7/48 too, we are free to do pious deeds or sins but result is awarded by God in the shape of happiness and sorrows respectively. But he has given us the knowledge of Vedas and has showered his mercy on us to follow the Vedic path to kill the sins/deeds of our previous and present lives and thus to get salvation. And yes you're very much right that the human body is blessed by God giving us a chance to follow the Vedic path to realize God. Upwardds mean to get progress day by day to purify the soul etc. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> One thing swami jee, every soul that leaves this earth, already pays for the bad karma accumulated on this earth itself but will it assimilate or not assimilate in to paramatma depends on its level of purity. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> And level of purity comes by real worship according to Vedas. So one must listen the Vedas and then study the Vedas to follow the preaches. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> My experience is in initial stages when a person tries to purify himself he faces hoards of challenge, sleep is one of them, but slowly as he gains control on his indriya or senses, the challenge he faces, appears soothing and sukhadayi. Then at this stage money, power, friends, enemies, pain, sorrow, happiness, hunger, becomes meaningless, because these are related with the body and its senses, the soul does not know anything about these. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes there are five vrittis i.e., pramaann, vipraya, vikalp, nidra and smriti. In Yoga shastra pt I these problems have been mentioned and way to rectify the same. The book is in Hindi please. So amongst five the nidra i.e., sleep/laziness is also to be controlled. Soul actually knows about the above said matters. Actually by real worship when soul becomes able to realize himself then he know the difference between him and the materialistic articles i.e., difference between alive and non alive matters, truth and illusion etc. Otherwise soul does not know himself. This matter is also stated in pt I of above Yog shastra. Comment on which have been written by me in detail. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> The soul again which is also formless, tasteless, shapeless, cannot be destroyed by fire, water, wind, etc. neither it can be created or nor it can be destroyed. Now in a way soul is similar to God, but why separate? Well adivaita or dvaita discussion is never ending. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> That is why Yajurveda mantra 2/26 states that soul is "swyambhu" i.e., eternal. Soul is alive always away from illusion, immortal, and is really shape of merriment. But has forgotten himself due to indulgement with prakriti. But soul is never similar to God, but has very few, even limited qualities equivalent to God and not full. For example--- soul comes in body to face his karmas whereas God not etc., etc. Please read Yog Shastra sutra1/26 in this connection. Adwait matter in the new Vedanta is totally against the eternal knowledge of Vedas which emanates direct form God. I am sending also my book on Vedanta which will clarify the matter in questions. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> This universe which is created automatically by eternal God or cosmos or cosmic power, or cosmic energy, is mithya a big lie because it sooths or seduces our senses, again a big distraction for all the souls with bodies. The one which is invisible i.e. God, souls, prakriti (for me it is the sky or space which I can hold in my closed palm) are the only truth and eternal. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> God is not cosmos but is omnipresent, please. God is separate, soul is separate and prakriti made universe is separate from each other. Yes, jagat is mithya which means it is made from prakriti and is destroyed but turned again into the shape of prakriti. It means the matter is never destroyed but changes its shape. So universe is not mithiya and too is not lie. In this connection Rigved mantra 10/190/3 also refers. Each article of the universe is non-alive and therefore can not sooth or seduce the soul. This is only alive soul who attracts towards materialistic article of universe being indulged in illusion due to his own previous sins. God and soul as i have told above are alive matter and prakriti is non-alive. God is one whereas souls are countless but constant in number. If one will try to bind the God within closed palm it will be quite impossible and beyond calculation even. Because God will reside not only within palm but he is everywhere i.e., out of palm even. As reagrds soul the matter is same. No remains prakriti. For prakriti it is also not possible. Why? Prakriti always remains in a stage of pralaya, i.e., final destruction of universe and who will keep the prakriti in palm. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> Universe and everything that is visible can be destroyed by man also, 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Nobody can destroy the visible article. Who will destroy the sky and air please? And if a house, stone can be destroyed then too the same will change its shape only, please. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> If Soul was a separate entity, why would it be bothered about bad Karma etc.? It is good for the soul to stay on this earth and keep coming again and again, and enjoy or satisfy their senses to the full and be sensually happy. Why even bother about God (May God forgive me)? Don't you think it is the attraction between the God and the soul, which pulls it apart from all the sensory distractions to return to paramatma once for all, for its complete assimilation? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Soul will have to bother about bad karmas because she has to face the result of thereof in the shape of sorrows etc. Enjoyment and sorrows are based on pious and bad karmas and not in the power of soul. Therefore soul has a power only to kill the deeds by doing pious deeds according to Vedas to get permanent merriment/salvation. God is almighty and gives merriment based on karmas. So naturally soul must attract towards God because originally soul is also a shape of merriment but has forgotten his shape being indulged in illusion. Atharvaveda says a word--- "parishwangdharmi", i.e., soul has a quality which is natural one, to get attracted towards anywhere. But being in human body she has two way to adopt due to his said quality either towards God i.e., pious path or towards materialistic articles of the world i.e., illusion. Now a days due to lack of knowledge of spiritualism mostly the children are attracted towards illusion. So it is not necessary that soul is attracted towards God only. An acharya who knows the Vedic philosophy is needed to guide the soul properly which is an eternal need for soul as mentioned in four Vedas. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> Take your case you have worked in Indian Army and must have fought a war or two but what kept you pulling towards God? Vedas and spirituality, is it not your already purified soul probably in your previous births? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> I can tell you a fundamental. Such souls have been doing tapsya duly related with previous births, please. This is not the result of present birth only. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Anonymous:</b> My father was in Indian Airforce too) same thing with my father, he was a staunch devotee, and me, I am born and brought up in defense environment and I stayed for almost 23 years in defense camps till I completed my education. Now I am in Canada, but why this pull towards God? It has been there since I was 10. My father had to search for me during janmastami and other jagratas, who told me to go there and stay awake till the puja is over, not my parents (Though the atmosphere existed in my home) but is it not the soul's constant quest to attain moksha from this cycle of birth and death, and this pull is triggered by the purity of soul. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> I am glad to listen about your respected father and you too. You are having the spiritual affects within you from your father and that is why you're taking keen interest in spiritualism. Sorrows/suffering matter is mentioned in sutra 2/3 of Yoga shastra pt I in which death is also a great sorrow amongst five. Soul does not happy with death etc., so naturally attracted towards God to get salvation, but specially those who have good affect of spiritualism traditionally. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> Don't you think The soul is a part of God (Please do not take it as a physical part broken from main part) we are talking about something which is similar and invisible like prakriti. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No please soul can never be part of God as I already explained in my previous e-mail and has explained above too quoting Yog shastra 1/26. Secondly soul is never similar to God. Soul has limited qualities whereas God has unlimited qualities, for example-God is omnipresent but soul is not etc., etc. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> So again prakriti is live which makes prakriti, God and soul all alike and same. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Prakriti is not live please. Otherwise every materialistic article which is made of prakriti would have been doing deeds like us and could not be destroyed. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> The air we breath is a part of prakriti, is God again, without which the body cannot live more than few minutes. So the soul needs constant unconditional support from the God in form of air, water, etc. all this to finish the task on earth. So again when are we separate as a soul, Never! 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Body can not live, air and body both being non-alive made of prakriti. But soul needs no air, food, water etc., to live upon, being alive and immortal and not created like air, body etc. Therefore soul needs no such unconditional support please. It is body which requires. So we, the soul are always separate from almighty God as soul is not almighty. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> You said creation is eternal and beyond our imagination, I am sorry I differ from your view: If universe (Prakruti) is eternal, there should not be any talk about "God creates and destroys universe"
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Eternal means creation, nursing, and destruction is eternal and automatic, please. This fact is mentioned in mandal 10 sukta 129 and 190 of Rigveda and chapter 31 of Yajurveda, though it is in all four Vedas. It is also in Bhagwat Geeta chapter tenth. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> Another visible manifestation of God is Sun, aditya, which is the sole reason why we are active(living) in the day and loose our consciousness (in form of sleep-dead)in the night. That also means soul does not have power to keep the body alive it simply resides in it. It is the Sun which is connecting, the deep unconscious (invisible, God) with the conscious (body, prakruti or that which is visible) so that it can live, which again means God is needed for a body to live, which also resides in the body along with the soul in form of air. So again soul needs God to get things done. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> God needs nothing please. But after creation, he enters the universe and that is why is called omnipresent. Soul is self sufficient, body needs energy for which every facility has been made by God. Soul being master of the body while residing in it utilize the body and every article of the universe either for spiritualism to get salvation or for worldly enjoyment to get rebirth to be indulged in sorrows. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> You said God alive, soul alive, prakriti not alive. I do not see any difference between God and prakriti, both are same. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> If both are same then why prakriti is under control of God? So both are not same please. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> In chemistry we have something called inter molecular spaces, even that space is occupied by God, which correctly defines Vishnu as sarva bhuta vyapecha (please correct me, I left sanskrit 25 years back). 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Vishnu word is made from dhatu vishlri which means omnipresent. So there is no other Vishnu. In Yajurveda mantra 40/17 it is stated, "Om Kham Brahm", i.e., God is everywhere, even the name of God is Kham i.e., space. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> I also differ with your view that souls come to earth to work hard, meet their families, etc, working hard, earning money, meeting families all this depends on the direction the soul had taken, in this industrial modern world, every person has to work to earn money and survive, but all this has nothing to do with soul and God and their purpose. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Can dead body do any task please? It is oul which was using the body and its organs. Work hard for establishing body and to live in house etc., which will give soul to worship with concentration, otherwise a beggar can not perform yaj, can not study Vedas etc. And it is stated clearly by God in Vedas like rigveda mantra 10/121/10 to become rich by earning. Misuse means freeship, please. Otherwise God can not tell us to misuse his power. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> Finally, God is something above give and take, it is the soul which chooses to come back on this earth, so that it can purify itself but poor thing it looses its memory and objectivity of moksha or emancipation and gets lost in this maya. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> If soul choose to come back she will never come back in the body of snake, lizard, and intestinal worms etc. Soul is originally purified please as stated above. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>S P Ianala:</b> God is unconditional, he even have mercy for people like hitler, but one thing is for sure God will not respond, if not called for, even after one response, we have to continue calling him to sustain the response. Hope you will forgive me for contradicting your view, it is my experience with God, and has nothing to do with Vedas, because I am new to Vedas. I am looking forward to read your precious books and literature. Thanks! 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> God has no mercy and never excuses any sin. He gives punishment. I am happy with your questions please and bless you a long happy life. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> If God is not visible (Nirakar), which cannot be perceived through the sense organs, is he unknown "ideal", is it therefore a symbol "OM", "SWASTIK" or an "IDOL" used to reach the unknown? Is it that "idol" leads the worshipper to the "Ideal"? How really Rishis, Munis and Yogis meet God? I believe God is available to everyone? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> God is alive and not non-alive. If somebody live far from you and a person describe his qualities then you are able to know him without seeing. So is the case of God. When anybody listens his qualities from Vedas, he becomes able to know God by means of worldly knowledge. Thereafter when he practise philosophy of Vedas then he realizes God. Headache is only realized but can not be seen, so is the case of God based on the guess one can believe that the creation has been made by somebody and he is God. Because creation is not a task of man etc. So what is the problem to realize him. Om is the name of God. Everybody is known by his name. So is God. But secrets are to be known from an acharya.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There is only one formless God who creates, nurses and destroy the universe. His names according to his qualities are uncountable. Due to lack of knowledge of Vedas people have started brahma, vishnu, mahesh etc., as separate God. It is wrong. Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh are also the name of one God, who is creator. For example from vishlri dhatu with sense of omnipresent Vishnu word is made. And meaning of Vishnu is omnipresent. And omnipresent is one God and equivalent to this God there is no other God. So is the case of Brahma, and Mahesh etc.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There is no Vedic explanation for such thing. It could have been made a custom by human beings. When a body is cremated, Vedic rituals are made by mantras being one of the Vedic sanskaar amongst sixteen sanskaars.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> One should recite the holy name of God i.e., "Om" and also gayatri mantra with meanings word by word. Actually one should get diksha from an acharya. Concentration is not made on mind, but mind has to be concentrated on particular point or subject etc. It requires practice of yam, niyam, asan, pranayaam, pratyahar, dharnna and dhayan then one attains samadhi. In this path guidance of a spiritual master who knows Vedas and ashtang yoga philosophy is needed. Holy name jaap of God helps a lot. I have written a book on yoga which can be sent on receipt of your postal address. However personal guidance as stated is essential. Actually to adopt brahamcharya firmly is only the right path to increase memory.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Brahman/Brahmin= performs yaj daily, does ashtang yoga practice, obey Vedas' preach, study Vedas daily, tells, listens and does deeds based on Vedic truth. Brahma= knows four Vedas, and from Brahma only the Yaj is performed and completed when a yajmaan requests him to perform the Yaj. In the absence of Brahma no Yaj is considered to be completed.

                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> God is both personal and impersonal. God cannot be fathomed by human mind. All untruths are result of man creativity and ultimately BRAHM (AUM) is the reality.Can God, out of love and compassion for his devotee assume any form the devotee wishes? As nothing is impossible for him! If devotee sincerely prays to him(chosen deity - ISHTA DEVATA), God reveals the truth about his true nature. Is this method possible? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Personal and impersonal words are not clear. God is almighty and showers blessing for those who worship and are always pious by following the truth. He gives punishment to those who commits sins. God is formless, almighty and beyond imagination etc., which i have several times stated. And untruth is illusion not created by man, but men i.e., souls are attractive towards illusion and faces sorrows etc. No please, God does not assume any form and does not obey any order but we all have to obey his orders mentioned in Vedas. Nothing is impossible for God means he too maintains his own Vedic philosophy which is but natural according to Yajurveda mantra 1/5, he is truth and never away from truth. It does not mean that he excuses any sins of anybody without worship and without burning illusion and becoming unable to do sin. He observes only truth that is why his name is also, "Vratpati". He always teaches in Vedas that, o! Man observe justice, do not favour anybody who is liar etc., observe truth after considering Vedic proof only, co-operate and try to be honest for everybody. Discharge only those duties/deeds which gives good result of merriment in this world and after death too. Otherwise all deeds are sins etc., etc. Ishta means almighty, formless God who creates, nurses and destroys the universe.

                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> What is the meaning of word "ADVAITA"?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The Vedic meaning of Advaita is A + Dvait i.e., A = not and Dwait = another, so there is no other equivalent to almighty, formless, omnipresent, God who creates, nurses and destroys the universe. So there is only one God of the universe, was one and will always remain one, which is also told in Yajurveda mantra 27/36, i.e., "na jaatah na janishyati". Meaning: no other God is born, all will be born equivalent to one God who is creator of the universe. So it is against the Vedas that soul or any materialistic article of the universe is God, like sun, moon, soul, sky, etc., etc., etc. Because God is indulged in illusion for sometime and God separates souls and universe from him which is all against the Vedas. Yajurveda mantra 40/8 clearly states that God is 'Shudham Apaapvidham' i.e., God is the purest and is always away from any kind of illusion and sins etc., then how illusion can dare to attack on God?

How do you reason with people who judge someone purely based on their religion? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Religion is to discharge moral duties and pious deeds in the present life which in return will give the person permanent happiness/merriment in this life as well as after death. Vaisheshik shastra sutra 1/2 refers. And our motto is to realize God while discharging moral duties etc. The friction is due to not understanding the truth/religion being indulged in illusion. But think that they are following the religion. Mostly the people can talk that they are religious minded, God fearing etc., but to become the same, true advice from Vedas, shastras etc., daily havan, listening Vedas' preach, contact with learned acharya of Vedas and holy granth and ashtang yoga practice under guidance of a learned acharya is necessary. Otherwise how wil a man be a religious one at his own. The qualities are checked only by a learned acharya according to Vedas/holy granths which the acharya knows.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> People do not want to be cheated. Actually they do not know the truth being mostly indulged in illusion. Illusion is over by the guidance of a learned acharya of Vedas and ashtang yoga philosophy. Due to lack of such acharya there is a problem mentioned also by samkhya shasttra's Muni Kapil in sutra 3/81. If bhakti is everything then why Shri Krishna preached about karmas, (hard working) and ashtang yoga philosophy. I would like to advice you to study my book Geeta Ek Vedic Rahasya, please, if possible. It is also said about God that God is everlasting beyond imagination, cannot be realized by eye, nose, etc., and is unchangeable. Then how can he change himself in any form?

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Pooja word is from Sanskrit, please. Its meaning is to give honour, respect and to adore etc., to almighty God, parents, elders and aged persons etc. What happens that due to lack of knowledge of Vedas mostly the people have made their own meanings. For example--- pious 'tirth' word is mentioned in Vedas. It is also mentioned in Yajurveda mantra 4/11. In Vedas its meaning are as under---
                <br> 1. Means where study of Vedas and following eternal religious path is provided. 
                <br> 2. The place where Yaj and preaches of eternal knowledge of Vedas to follow, are given to cross over the worldly illusion to get salvation. 
                <br> 3. Boat to cross the river because boat makes us able to cross the river. 
                <br>
                <br> Similarly the above quoted two places enable us to cross the worldly illusion to get salvation. But you see that the people have made their own meanings of pious vedic word 'tirth'. So is the case of pooja. Pooja is not which is being done by providing flowers, sweets, dish plate with lamp, dhoop bati, etc., etc., the meaning of pooja is as above. So we must do pooja of mother, father, atithi, acharya and almighty God. Thus the pooja of parents, atithi, elders etc., is to give them respect, to provide them with sweet speech, clothes, food, and other suitable goods, money etc. So the best worship of God is to listen Vedas, doing Yaj/havan and following the path of Vedas to discharge our duties and to practise ashtang yoga philosophy, because nobody can offer clothes, food or goods etc., to God because he needs nothing but always gives. And the said pooja is mentioned in all four Vedas. So this is the exact meaning of pooja according to eternal philosophy of Vedas, which was in practice in the life of our ancient rishis, King Manu, Dashrath, Harischandra, Yudishthir, Shri Ram, Shri Krishna and their public till Mahabhart war. Thereafter within two thousand years mostly the eternal type of above quoted pooja seems to be on tips and mostly own paths to worship God against the Vedas have been made. These path have destroyed aryans-indians i.e., our eternal culture based on which only our country used to be called "golden bird" and "spiritual guru of whole of the world". Tulsi Dass in his Ramayana has very well expressed his views in his following chopai in Uttra Kand --- "SHRUTI SAMMAT HARI BHAKTI PATH SANJUT BIRATI BIBEK. TEHIN NA CHALHIN NAR MOH BAS, KALPANHIN PANTH ANEK." Meaning: 
                <br>Tulsi states that there is an eternal worship based on Vedas, which gives us ascetism and factual knowledge. But the people are not following the path of Vedas due to attachment (attachment with materialistic, pomp and show and family etc.) And the people make their own new several paths of worship. So where I wrote (as you said) pooja/havan it is correct because i have used the word havan. And when I wrote Dosh Nivarnn Pooja, it is not mentioned in Vedas, it is also correct, please. 
                <br>

                <b>Bachan Singh:</b> Is it possible to any swamiji, panditji, Jyotishi or tantrik to change the life of a person who does not want change his life? Means is possible to get anything with the help of above but without doing anything? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Not possible please. In symbolic language there is a story that vidya (knowledge) once came to rishi shouting pahi mam, pahi mam i.e., protect me, protect me. In reply the rishi asked, "how can I protect you?" Vidya replied, "please do not give me to unauthentic, incapable, undesired and lazy person, otherwise I shall be thrown in vain." Yajurveda too clearly states that he who is not hard worker and has got no inspirations is not able to gain knowledge. Actually we all are free to do sins or pious deeds but the result is awarded by God in the shape of facing sorrows, tensions, diseases and happiness respectively. So learned people always choose true path to follow.

                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> What is the meaning of mantra "EKAM SAT VIPRAH BAHUDA VADANTI"? Also please explain meaning of RIG VEDA mantra reference 1-164-46. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Rig-Veda mantra 1/164/46 says," EKAM SADRUPA VIPRAH BAHUDHA VADANTI," i.e., EKAM SATAM means truth is one i.e., God is one but VIPRAH = Rishis, Munis who were/are learned of Vedas, BAHUDHA VADANTI utters so many names of God mentioned in Vedas like AGNIM YAMAM MATRISHVANAM AAHUHU meaning-the name of God are Agni, Yam, Matrishva and AAHUHU means "says". Yajurveda mantra 32/1 the name of God are told AGNI, ADITYA, VAAYU, CHANDRMA, SHUKRAM, BRAHM, AAPAH, AND PRAJAPATIHI ETC, ETC, ETC. In short I would explain the meaning of above all the names of God but not in detail because which are not possible here being lengthy. AGNI= agrini i.e., at the top or who comes first or who was before the creation and according to the said qualities, here the meaning of Agni pertains to God i.e., God is eternal and therefore exists always before the creation etc. that is why Rigveda mantra 1/1/1 says AGNIM IIDRHE --------------- IN the said mantra the meaning of Agni is God according to the qualities and situation. Meaning of IIDRHE means desire. Therefore the meaning of Agnim Iidrhe is, "I am desirous of God. Similarly YAM means controller of universe, Matrishva means air i.e., like air God gives life to human beings. Aditya means which cannot be broken into pieces, Chandrma means like moon God gives calm/peace, Shukram means Almighty, Braham means the superior/the biggest/the greatest etc., in the universe, Aapah means omnipresent, Prajapatihi means who nurse the universe. So all the said meanings have the qualities of God and hence the name of God in the Vedas, but are always uttered by Rishis Munis who are learned of Vedas as mentioned in Rig-Veda mantra quoted above. Therefore only Rishis Munis who are learned of Vedas utters or tells the holy name of God mentioned in Vedas and those who do not know Vedas can never utter the above holy names of God. But the said holy names on the other hand are even of surprising nature to them. One thing more the holy name of God in the Vedas are according to the nature, knowledge and deeds (God creates, nurses, destroys and controls the universe etc.) of Almighty God. Therefore those names are eternal and countless. So I am not able to mention here infinite names of Almighty God being --- beyond imagination, beyond calculation and beyond description, etc. and we have to worship the said Almighty God whose description is in four Vedas whose study has mostly been made stopped by the presently saints who were against the Vedas and speaks only charming stories etc., and never tells about Vedas. Whereas the description of Vedas in Geeta, Ramayana, six shastras, Upnishads and all ancient holy books. The reason behind that the present said saints do not study the Vedas and do not do Yajna and do not obey ashtang yoga philosophy mentioned in Vedas and adopted by Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, Mata Sita, King Harishchandra, king Dashrath and their subjects/public etc. therefore we must be aware of false prophets. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> Why Hindu felt it necessary to give so many names to one God, and why this freedom of choice has been mistaken for worship of many Gods. Is it that different qualities of the one God are represented by different Devatas? What does word "KOTI" really means in Sanskrit? Is it million or some kind of class? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> It is due to lack of knowledge of Vedas. Koti means crore. But Vedas always speak to worship only one formless almighty, omnipresent God. And as regards devta there are only five devtas who are to be worshipped when they are alive. Those are mother, father, atithi, achrya and fifth is almighty God. Thirty three devtas are non-alive and not to be worshipped. Description of which has been given several times on this web site.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Mantra means deep discussion and deep consideration/thought.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> I have already told the meaning of of Sachidanand i.e., sat+ chetan+ anand which are the three qualities of almighty God. Sat means which remains forever, i.e., in past, present, and future and cannot be destroyed. Chetan means alive. Anand means whose feature is of merriment. These are only three qualities of God among unlimited qualities. So Sachidanand is also a name of God.

                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> What is meaning of word "VIBHUTIS"? How does one experience God? What does tenth Chapter of "BHAGAVAD GITA" says about Seventy Five "VIBHUTIS"?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The meaning of vibhuti is dignity/supernatural power. It requires an experience acharya who knows Vedas and ashtang yoga philosophy to preach Vedas and to give knowledge of ashtang yoga. Geeta shlok 10/7 and 20 are to be kept in mind attentively duly discussed with an acharya who knows Vedas and ashtang yoga philosophy. Then only one will be able to understand about vibhuti. The said shlokas states the aspirant who knows Shri Krishna by tatv (tatv means realization) he only knows Shri Krishna, after practising yoga philosophy with full concentration and reaching at seventh stage of ashtnag yoga i.e., meditation and thereafter samadhi. In the shlok word yogen and yujyate is mentioned. Yog means samadhi and samadhi means realization of God. In shlok 20 words, 'Aham sarvbhootashyasthitah atma' are mentioned, which means "I, Shri Krishna resides in all human beings' heart and secondly it is stated that I (Shri Krishna) is atma. Now deep consideration will only enlight that there is only one formless God, who is almighty, does not take avatr and he is omnipresent etc. And as stated in Vedas like Yajurveda mantra 37/2 etc., almighty formless God being omnipresent only is manifests in the heart of a yogi. Yask muni too says, "asya atma shariram", i.e., symbolically the soul is a residence of almighty God. So all this clarifies that when the God is manifested in the heart of a yogi then yogi becomes equivalent to God but not God. At this samadhi stage the yogi can use the word, "I" as God. So the case of Shri Krishna Maharaj in Geeta and chapter 10 also. He was adorable, complete yogeshwar.

It is humble request as I will surely try to do in that manner. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Chudi and sindur has been a custom of a married woman. As regards routine life it is a lengthy preach but in short i will try to mention here. I have written a book on brahamcharya in hindi which is in printing press and may be available within fortnight. In that book guidance on routine life are also mentioned. You must study the book. One must awake early in the morning at about four o' clock. After going bathroom you must do holy name jaap of God. Then must do practice of asan, pranayaam and meditation. In the sunlight one must do havan daily. One must also study Vedas and holy books daily. Then whole day is there to discharge moral duties/to earn money etc. the said practice must be tried to repeat in the evening also.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Shivji Maharaj was a purn yogi. He knows Vedas, shastras etc. Such dignitaries never take any addiction. However, we must follow the path of Vedas, which is a real worship of formless, almighty, and omnipresent God who creates, nurses and destroy the universe.

Actually it has been a tradition of our ancient and present Rishis Munis that while performing naamkaran sanskaar of a child they give name to the child from Vedas.

Today is toxic world; everything is getting polluted in some way or the other (even human mind). Today's Mankind has misused the resources of God and has forced innocent man to follow wrong path. The result will be faced by coming generation by paying heavy price for not following law of Veda's/Nature and not taking care of it? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes please. It is only due to lack of knowledge of Vedas and people are still paying heavy price experiencing several sorrows etc.

                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> Sri Guruji, as you said Knowledge is gain, only when provided. This way I keep gifting needy people true spiritual books, so that they can realise the truth themselves and get started on path of spiritualism (towards the path of oneness, the Veda's). 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> yes please. Our education do not promote our eternal culture and hence problem. You may go ahead to spread vedic knowledge which is a pious deed and a worship of God.

                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> Why Yoga is given so much important for obtaining liberation from life &amp; death cycle? I believe God listens to soul who is pure and total Satwic, and will also accept him, even if does not practice yoga methods. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No please. To control all the chitt vrittis and to purify mind, (antahkaran including body too) ashtang yoga practice is necessary. You're right to say that if our mind is pure then God will listen. But please add mind is made pure by practising yoga philosophy and listening Vedas. Otherwise mind will never be pure.

                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> We find all over so many Hinduism ritual practices, so many Hindu Gods and Goddess and Temples, so many different mantras of Gods and Goddess for japas. Is there any standard in Hinduism? What really religion means? When we say God is one, then what is the "name" of that one supreme lord? What is mantra for supreme lord? Who is that supreme lord who is beyond the limitation and calculation of time? How do we experience God? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There is only one formless God who creates, nurses and destroy the universe but he is not known until an aspirant listens Vedas. The problem has arisen due to lack of knowledge of Vedas. Religion means to do the pious deeds according to Vedas which give us happiness and peace in the present life as well as after death. Actually an acharya who knows Vedas and ashtang yoga philosophy, is needed regularly for guidance. The names of God are unlimited according to his divine qualities but in Vedas, his best name is "Om". The procedure to do the jaap of "Om" is required to be understood from the acharya.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Every cow gives satvic milk. No doubt the cow milk is the best but the buffalo milk can be used in case of non-availability of cow milk. I am writing a book on cow and other information will be available in the book.

As much as hard and more practice will be there you'll get more and more benefit and take less time to gain knowledge /peace etc., if you'll be slow accordingly you'll take more and more/long time to realize. So i think there is no much importance of forty days because the full life is meant to worship daily according to Vedas and even in one life it is not sure that aspirant may be able to realize God. So is the case of 108, 1008. Actually this life is blessed by God to worship him till death.

                <b>Prasann:</b> We have been taught from many scripts that we must leave Aham. If consider my self as a atman and if I consider body is sensors to sense this physical world, even though I am there to enjoy these group of senses. So should I consider Aham as atman? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Here aham means ahankaar, i.e., pride/ ego, so one must always try to worship God according to Vedas by performing yagya and doing ashtang yoga practice to get the good result to give up pride/ego. Otherwise pride is too dangerous to mention, like the history of Ravana and Duryodhan.

                <b>Surya P Ianala:</b> I am a scientist in chemistry and I have intense interest and faith in our Vedas, shastras and other scriptures, I am trying to learn and practise them now. I understand the creation of universe is by God and also as you have explained Vedas were rendered automatically to four rishis by God. It all explains "how" it was done by God, but since a long time I have been curious to know, "Why" God did this, I mean creation of everything and then destruction of everything, I believe initially God separated a part of him as souls to take birth on this earth, but for that soul to re-assimilate into paramatma, it takes a great deal based on karma etc. but again "Why God took this exercise, what was the divine purpose. In a way did invisible prakriti existed before creation of visible universe from it, or it was created just before to create universe, swami jee I hope my question is clear. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Your interest in Vedas is appreciated please. This is actually a true worship to formless, almighty, immortal God. As regards creation it is automatic. Actually God has no desire. Like a potter who builds pots from mud, the power of God works in prakriti (non-alive matter) and universe is created. This all has been mentioned in Rigveda mandal 10 sukta 129. I shall try to send you about creation by post being lengthy if you please send your postal address. Shwetashwaropnishad shlok 6/8 states - "swabhaviki gyan- bal-kriya", i.e., the knowledge, power and deeds of God are automatic i.e., God has no desire for the same. If someone sits alone then it is also automatic that his mind starts thinking etc. The creation is eternal and automatic/everlasting. In the above Rigveda mantra 10/129/7, it is clearly mentioned that God is creator, "sah yadi waa dadhe yadi waa na", i.e., He creates, nurses and destroy the universe. Suppose God does not create the universe then souls of all human beings will remain in shushupati awastha (like a comma stage), the souls will not get body to act. This will be like a lazy man who is not after hard working etc., and remains on bed for continue sleep. Definitely there will be then no sorrow, no happiness, no struggle, no working etc., etc., and the stage will be of a lazy man as stated above. Actually soul resides in body and as many as bodies are there, the number of souls are same. Souls are also immortal and not made by God even. God is lord of souls and universe. It is mercy of God on souls that he gives bodies to souls according to deeds of souls not to be remained in shushupati where there is no feeling but to work hard from the bodies to see family and get salvation. However, creation is eternal and automatic. It is beyond control of our feelings and imagination, please. You know that God is immortal and formless, unchangeable, etc., so how a change in God (to separate a part) is possible. Even nobody can imagine to break sky to convert into pieces. There are uncountable names of God in Vedas according to his divine qualities. One name of God is also, "Aditya", from "do awakhandne" dhatu, the word 'aditi' (immortal/unbreakable) is made and by doing taddith from it, the word Aditya is made, which is a name of immortal God, its meaning is, he who cannot be broken into pieces. So it is not possible that God will separate any piece from him to form souls or universe. God (alive), souls (alive) and third is prakriti which is non-alive, from which creation is made. All three are immortal, eternal and are separate from each other based on the qualities also. If we consider souls and world is a part of God (which is impossible), then naturally both will be having qualities equal to God but it is not there. Souls is bound to face the result of his good or bad deeds in the shape of happiness or sorrows respectively whereas God never faces. And the worldly articles are non-alive and also cannot be a part of God. God is lord of universe if universe is God (being a part thereof) then there will be no question of being lord. Even there will be no question of omnipresent in respect of God. 
                <br>
                <br> Prakriti is also never created by God. It is eternal. The creation is from prakriti. I will send the details by post please. I have written a book about Vedanta in English which can be sent on receipt of your postal address, please.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> My blessings to you for a happy life. I already said that Vedas are not history book. It is an eternal knowledge emanates direct from God at the time of beginning of every creation. So Vedas do not contain any personal names please. Our rishis munis had a trend to name a new born baby from Vedas by performing naam karann sanskaar. So the rishis gave name shri ram and shri krishna from Vedas. I repeat that Vedas are not history book. Vedas contain fundamenatl laws. Vedas contain gyan kand, karam kand and upasana kand. In the ancient times the knowledge of Vedas was door to door and people were learned. Due to bad luck of india mahabahrt war took place and due to broken hearts effecting killing at a huge stage the remaining people consisting of old ladies and children could not continue the path of Vedas and hence the next generation indulged in illusion. The effect of which is still being seen. So most of the people are not aware of the knowledge of the Vedas. Who knows the real words and meaning of Vedas. I only here quote a Rigveda mantra 1/164/39 wherein it is stated by God if you study the Vedas only but you have not followed the preach in action by means of doing yajyen and hard practice of ashtnag yoga and thus you have not realized God then--- "Richa kim karishiyasi, i.e., only Ved mantras will do nothing. And if anybody attains samadhi and gains the said knowledge, he will naturally start speaking only about one God, the description of whom is in Vedas. He will praise God only. So it is the philosophy of Vedas which clarify that Vedas do not contains any name (proper nouns, etc.,) , and if anybody from Islam says his personal views he is authorized/ free to preach because it is his faithful sect. And Vedas are aryans eternal path. Everybody is free to adopt any path. We must aware of our vedic culture. Kindly promote Vedas to educate aryans to know about truth because truth is God and God is truth. And love is God and God is love. If we are lack of knowledge of Vedas then surely we will be thrown in illusion and everybody will be able to teach his own path. This has been a problem with aryas/hindus that we have also made such our own paths which makes us to go against the eternal knowledge of Vedas. If we are illiterate then how we will be able to know truth and express truth before the society. In Rigveda and Atharvaveda, there is a pious word Narashanshaha which I have already explained in detail with full mantra and is placed on this web site please.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> We have no comments on the above statement because he is preaching his religion for which he is free. We have to say about our eternal religion that is eternal knowledge of Vedas. In Atharvaveda mantra 7/2/1 and in other Vedas also it is clarified that at every creation God first creates unsexual human beings/living beings who attains the young body and not child or old. Because in case of children, who will nurse them, and in case of old pregnancy is not possible, so the facts are well known by almighty God who is omniscient. That is why in Vedas the name of God is also Pragya (in pure Sanskrit it is Prajyen). The meaning of Pragya is He who knows all about the universe and even beyond. And whose knowledge is beyond illusion and misunderstanding etc. Now also you see in newspaper and TV that a cruel mother throws a newly born baby and baby is either died or is located before death and nursed in hospital. I have no comments please because every religion is free to say anything. So we all Arya must also study the eternal knowledge of Vedas, to spread the knowledge door to door, also to promote international brotherhood. Learned acharya of Vedas like Vyas Muni etc., knows about the fundamental laws of God. Such personnel do not accept purans please. So no comments.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Truth is truth. Truth is unchangeable please. The knowledge emanates from the God at the beginning of the earth is in four Vedas which are eternal and true. Vedas are our proof. The matter which is not mentioned in Vedas are always considered unauthentic and is therefore not acceptable. So there is no mention of opposite party whether the party accepts or not. But one thing is there that one should always avoid blind faith. Mangalik/teva etc., are not mentioned in Vedas please. Every day and times are created by God and thus are pious. The pooja or any pious function can be performed on any date /time. It is our own good/ bad deeds, the result of which we have to face and we starts saying that the day is pious or bad.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> If we have no time to listen and follow Vedas then God also has no time to bless us with a long happy life by killing our sins of our previous lives' which creates sorrows. In Yajurveda it is clearly mentioned that the person who leaves spiritualism, God and learned acharya then the God in return also leaves him to face the sorrows, problems, tensions, diseases and to face dehik, bhautik and adhyatmik taaps, i.e., sorrows. So Yajurveda mantra 7/48 states that we are free to do pious or deeds pertaining to sins but result is always awarded by God in the shape of happiness and sorrows respectively. So it is up to us to choose the path. My daughter, my blessings are always with you and I am happy to receive the above questions from you which one day will sure throw light in your life.

I realise that both the Vedas and Quran talk about the same one God who is formless. Infact I think both the Quran and the Vedas as far I as I know (my knowledge is limited on both) talk about only good things and ONE GOD. I respect both the books as both are the word of God.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes please. Both holy granths talks about one formless god. As per as vedas are concerned it is an eternal knowledge emanates direct from god at the beginning of every creation (because god creates, nurses and destroys and again creates the universe and this tradition is eternal). In new creation there remains no any spiritual master to give knowledge and therefore almighty guru only gives knowledge of vedas, which philosophy i have told several times and still pasted on this web site.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> "Om" is from vedas and "Allah" is from Kuran sharif but one thing is clear that Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Isai, Parsi, Jain, etc., etc., are sects which have not been made by god. God has given the knowledge of eternal vedas. The sects have come into existence within two thousand years. Now it is one's own decision to follow any path. If you think to accept the name of god as "Allah" then we have got no problem. And you should have no problem for them who recite the eternal name of god as "Om". Please do whatever you like.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> I really appreciate that you have stopped eating non-veg. In Atharvaveda it is clearly mentioned that god excuses this sin of taking non-veg before. Please maintain this forever. This was a great violence which you have finished. Secondly the havan is also the best worship of the god and it will give you really the best result.

                <b>Deepak Chainani:</b> I have one Muslim salesman he says when god sent first 2 persons name adam and hava begam that’s why life starts with Muslim dharam than all the vedas also came out from Kuran Sharif. And he says like only Kuran Sharif is like aasmani book Allah self gave inspirations to write is while vedas were written by rishi munis so everybody should follow only Kuran Sharif and I dont have reply to give him. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There is no doubt that Muslim religion has come into existence approximately within two thousand years. Whereas vedas are eternal and as usual came into existence in this creation about one arab ninety six crore eight lakhs and about 54 thousand years ago, i.e., at the beginning of the earth. In whole of the world it is accepted that vedas are only the ancient holy books. Secondly it is also a misunderstanding that rishi/munis wrote vedas. The knowledge of vedas always emanates direct from almighty god and is originated in the heart of four rishis at the time of unsexual creation. Then only the four rishi becomes learned of vedas and starts teaching by mouth and knowledge thus spreads hearts to hearts without writing etc. Please see the article on vedic philosophy also. However Kuran Sharif is also a holy book of Muslim and too adorable. 
                <br>

                <b>Deepak Chainani:</b> You say there is on formless god, god has never take birth but in Shreemadbhagwat Geeta bhagwan Shree Krishna says I am everything and jab jab pap badte hai me janam leta hu than what is that? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> For every truth the main proof are vedas, which are called self proof. Vedas state that after getting the knowledge form a learned acharya. When a aspirant performs yajna, does pious deeds, discharges his moral dutues faithfully while the same he does practice of ashtang yoga and thus attains asamprgyat samadhi. At this stage of samadhi Almighty God becomes present within him. Saamveda mantra 944 states that at the stage of the Asamprgyat Samadhi within the yogi the preach of vedas utters which comes with the mouth of yogi duly inspired by god himself. So the yogi at this stage can say, "I am Ganesh, I am Shiva, I have created universe and all must worship me etc., etc." because at this stage the words utters by the yogi are inspired by god himself and the words are direct from god. Secondly the souls who had got salvation may come back and take birth to guide the people. And after doing his job the soul goes back at his own to realize salvation. This is as per Atharvaveda mantra 9/10/11. So within the soul of Shri Krishna Maharaj actually the words of god were uttered which are true. However, one must know that Yajurveda mantra 32/1 too says that there is only one formless god, who creates, nurses and destroys the universe. But his names are several according to his qualities. So Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Ganesh, Shiva are the names of god according to his qualities which I have briefed several times on this site please. Please check the site, otherwise send your question again.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No please. According to vedas we have to worship only one formless god who is almighty, omnipresent, immortal, and he only creates, nurses and destroys the universe. We only attains peace and destroy our sins by the worship of said formless god. Therefore the pooja as stated by you above is against the vedas.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Shri Hanumaan ji was a great warrior as well as the greatest learned yogi of vedas. This statement is available in Valmiki Ramayana when Hanumaan ji made conversation with Shri Ram in jungle. Vedas preach do not tell about any other worship except one formless god who is almighty, omnipresent, immortal, and he only creates, nurses and destroys the universe. We only attain peace and destroy our sins by the worship of said formless god. So you can put the statue of veer Hanumaan ji according to your wish because he is adorable but worship must be performed for formless god according to vedas which veer Hanumaan ji also did.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> According to Yajurveda mantra 7/48, we all human beings are free to do good or bad deeds but result is awarded by god in the shape of happiness, and sorrows, respectively. So anyone who is in tension etc., it is only due to the result of own deeds of previous lives' for which one must never feel worried. Yoga shastra sutra 2/16 clearly states that sorrows are burnt by worshipping god properly according to vedas. Therefore It is very much clear according to vedas that no black magic etc., is there. So you need not to worry. I advice you to do recite gaaytri mantra daily and to do havan. You'll get peace sure. Dreams will also be finished. Please also try to learn yog asan, pranayaam, meditation locally, as i am away so I can't teach you.

                <b>Neeraj K. Chauhan:</b> What is the importance of 40 days practice while going through any mantra Jap or any such kind of devotional practice? Even what is the significance of 108 times of jap in mantra Jap? These numbers of remembering the God i.e. 40 days, 108 times, 1008 time keeps any special importance or any thing else or for any special purpose. Please explain me in details? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yog shastra sutra 21/21 says that daily hard practice of mantra jaap/worship etc., must be performed. As much as hard and more practice will be there you'll get more and more benefit and take less time to gain knowledge /peace etc., if you'll be slow accordingly you'll take more and more/long time to realize. So I think there is no much importance of forty days because the full life is meant to worship daily according to vedas and even in one life it is not sure that aspirant may be able to realize god. So is the case of 108, 1008.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No such rule is mentioned in vedas, please. So you need not worry. Vedas are our self proof. It is a knowledge direct from god and is therefore authentic. The rules which are not mentioned in vedas are not applicable please.

So you can put the statue of Yogeshwar Shri Krishna Maharaj according to your wish because he is adorable but worship must be performed for formless god according to vedas. Yes, the knowledge to worship god is obtained from vedas and vedas are preached by a learned acharya. One can collect true knowledge according to vedas from anywhere. Shri Krishna Maharaj also learnt vedas and yoga philosophy from Rishi Sandeepan.

Out of these how many peoples see your website how many peoples curious of about Vedas, Hindu religion. In the time when transport was rare, not so modern. Then also Sri Dayananda Saraswati traveled India. Now when technology is so fast, why can you not use the technology why cant you start a TV channel? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> I heartily appreciate your views. But now the time is changed. During the time of Swami Dayanand Saraswati people were mostly villagers and illiterate too. Nowadays flood of gurus has come into existence, which are mostly against the Vedas. At this juncture too preach the Vedas to the public, who have made their own gurus is very difficult. Secondly at that time there was British govt., who did not interfere in religious matter and even the govt., mostly did justice in the religious matter. Whereas nowadays nobody can object others. Swami Dayanand ji raised Arya Samaj and got means to spread knowledge whereas i am too lack of finance/means to spread Vedas. But I think in the near future god will sure help me more and more.

                <b>S C:</b> Nowadays publicity is every thing Vedas are so pious but how can a man does study or gave respect without knowing it. (Nowadays publicity of other religions are in huge which criticize another religion) 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Criticism is not good. Love must always be there. We must tell always truth and we must not criticize. Vedas are not sect. It is knowledge direct from god and is applicable to all human beings. So it can be adopted while remaining in any sect. Truth is always truth and acts accordingly. But truth is only given by a learned of vedas. It is said in Rigveda that no merriment/peace without worship of god, no worship without the knowledge fo vedas and no knowledge without a learned acharya of vedas.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Religion conversions are not good. But what can we do, because everyone is free. It is also due to lack of real knowledge. So if people will be learned then the problem will automatically be solved. For-example, some people contacted one of my disciples in Sweden on the said matter. They showed their books. Immediately my disciple showed religious books to them, written by me. The persons without discussing the matter more went away. There are so many such examples. There is an old lady in Delhi, she got problem that suitable match for daughter was not being arranged. The pandit made teva, janampatri etc., and declared that her daughter will never be married. The so called pandit/jyotishi/their agents try to seek such houses to make the public fool and extort money out of them. Once such pandit entered her house and stated that he will make a jantri from Ramayana chopai and with the result a suitable match will be available soon. The lady was my disciple and has been listening vedas and doing havan with full concentration for the last many years. She had studied my all books even. So she replied the pandit that she has heard that Shri Ram ji had been listening the vedas from his Guru Vashisth, and was a complete yogi even. Shri Ram ji also told that vedas are the supreme/truth. She added is there something else above the vedas and is your jantri is above the vedas then please teach her. This answer from the learned lady was surprising to the pandit. The pandit gathered his all books, wrapped them in the cloth and ran away. Now her daughter is married and has one loving son and one loving daughter. So one must be educated in vedas.

                <b>S C:</b> I read your website. In this lot of people asking, swamijii Gujrat is burning what is your opinion etc.. people always says Lebanon burning, Gujarat burning, Kashmir burning but no one asks, how these violence begin, who started first this violence. I will not defend violence but they do not understand every action has equal and opposite reaction. Why cant they stop such actions, otherwise asking these questions? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> This is really a problem. We seek justice but all in vain. Why? People will only are only afraid of god. The constitution of the god is in four vedas wherein ravages of hatred are not allowed. Violence are not allowed. Mercy on poor and respect to elders, ladies and innocent children must always be there. What to talk, there are several pious deeds and advices are mentioned to adopt by all human beings, keeping aside that matter of sects, races, etc., etc. The human beings are punished by god badly to against the vedas. So, if the preach of vedas are spread honestly and are adopted by all human beings even following their own path, then sure the violence etc., will be finished and international brotherhood will be promoted. 
                <br>

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Minority or hate is generated in human beings who lack the knowledge of god. In the court of god there is no such option. When soul leaves the body then he is only soul and not anything else like sects, bodies etc. Now it depends under the law of god and based on souls' deed that where he will take birth or not. One thing more, it is also an eternal law of vedas that final destruction of the universe is sure and re-creation will then take place. At that time in new unsexual creation there will be no any race etc., bcuase god never makes it. Then the philosophy of vedas will as usual/automatically be applied to all human beings. There will be euqality, similarity at that time as usual. So two ways are there. Either the knowledge of vedas will spread by the grace of god and people will start loving each other or this quality will be applicable to all human beings after final destruction. So why to worry?

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> We are Aryans/Hindus. People do not know about vedas, and our ancient and present rishis. Our rishis-munis always do Naam Karann Sanskaar and select the pure names from vedas based on the qualities of pious eternal words. In Rigveda mantra the word bharat is there. Our ancient rishis named this place as bharat from vedas, keeping in view the literal meaning of pious word, "bharat", according to the real situation of that time. The meaning of Bharat is the people who knows and adopt the knowledge of vedas in their life. Really our ancient people of Bharatvarsh up to Mahabharat time had complete knowledge of four vedas. So the word Bharat automatically clarify that we have not come from outside, we are Bhartiya and our forefathers knew vedas based on which, this place was named as Bharat. So we need not any more proof from anywhere. We loved the people, we love the people and we gave shelter here to other people, to live here peacefully. We, therefore shall be loving people ever. But rules and regulations of Bhartavarsh must be strictly imposed to all by our leaders. But oh! What to talk about leaders? They themselves are also not aware of vedas. It is difficult to rule Bharatvarsh Like A King Janak, Harish Chandra, Dashrath, Shri Ram, Yayaati, Kuru, Puru, Yudhisthir etc., etc., who all knew the vedas and ruled all over the earth according to vedas politics.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Your mercy is genuine but nobody will help now a days. Because due to lack of knowledge of Vedas humanitarian grounds in the heart of people are not there. That is why I strongly stress that whole world must study vedas to shower mercy to the poor and helpless people. Preaches are there but exercise of the same is not seen because knowledge based on words only will never serve the purpose. One has to do worship, meditation etc., by which mind is moulded and leave the sins. We must know that Sri Ram, Sri Krishna, etc., etc., who were kings and ruled over the earth but first they learnt vedas and did meditation etc., and they adopted the preach of vedas in their daily life and with the result they served the human beings. Otherwise we will have to wait for final destruction/new creation.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No please. Dhyan is meant to realize god, but before dhyan one has to know about god. To know god preach of vedas is necessary. Worship by means of doing havan is necessary. Then only ashtnag yoga philosophy is practised wherein first path is yam, then niyam, asan, pranayaam, pratyahar, dharnna and then dhyan and thereaftwer samadhi. So only dhyan is not required, please. This is eternal and is unchangeable path, preached in vedas.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Problem, sorrows, happiness etc., are the result of own deeds which were done in the previous lives. So one should never think for the same. Present life is meant to work hard to make the future bright. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Akshay Juneja:</b> I feel very sad that why God make different destiny of everyone? I know that is because of their previous birth deeds. Swamiji, I am a spiritual man but I also want high level of success in life also. I want to prove that "Mein bhi kuch hoo" I know that it is mentality of many young boys and girls. But I don't want to pass out my life without any big work. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes you're correct they are excellent in many fields either due to their previous pious deed and present hard working. But it is clear that future is always in our hands and is made bright by doing hard working without wasting a second towards right path. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Akshay Juneja:</b> I think that why not I spend my life in very good deeds and helping poor ones and live my life as "Sab Kuch Krishan Arpan"? I want to do tapasya and work for others. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No doubt present hard work/pious deeds makes future births bright. Vedas says, "Idam Prajapatye Idan Na Mam". I.e., this all is of Almighty God and not mine. So better if we say the said Ved mantra. Actually vidwaan say, “Chah Gai Chinta Gai, Manva Beparvah. Jisko Kachhu N A Chahiye, So Hee Shanshah.” It means if someone is able to control his unnecessary desires then he is the best peaceful person in the universe. On the other hand good desires must be there. Satisfaction is also a great assets. You see Kabir was poor, Shabri was poor, but are being respected due to their hard working towards spiritualism. Shri Ram, Shri Krishna are being worshipped too due to their hard working towards worldly matter as well as spiritualism. But Ravna and Duryodhan are being remembered with hates due to their sins. Please always remember Geeta Shlok 2/47 wherein it is stated the philosophy of vedas that one has to do deeds without considering result thereof. Then there will be no repentance.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> As regards shubh din the days, nights and times are never ashubh (unfortunate) being created by the purest god. Only deeds done by us are bad or good. And based on the previous lives' deeds we have to face the result thereof accordingly on one particular day and time. So days are not good or bad. It is our own deeds done by us which is bad or good. So you can enter at your own at any day and time which suits you. However one should perform havan from ved mantras before entering. it does not depends on any name and date of birth etc. Because it is not mentioned in vedas. So we must be always away from blind faith. Our proofs are vedas, shastra and ancient holy books like upanishads, bhagwat geeta etc., which do not tell the same.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramwarup:</b> In my experience there is no such yoga please. Vedas say about ashtang yoga practice while studying vedas to realize god. However, sleep can be minimized according to the secret of chitta vritti. Because sleep is the matter of chitta and not soul. When there is illusion then soul acts according to chitta. Being a lengthy subject I can not describe here fully. I have written Yog Shastra part I and part II which may please be studied about chitta, vrittis and sleep, etc.

How is this possible or the epics were written of imaginary basis imposing them with real characters present during the time like a reporting of an incident for the purpose of a drama or may be other things written by another person born after the incident i.e. not belonging to the same time but has a vivid idea on which he is going to write like that of "Julius Caesar" written by William Shakespeare, which contains historical facts? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> They were contemporary i.e., all were present together at that time. They used to meet and listen about each other. The above said holy books are not on imagination and are not drama. Rishis/munis have no time to write to stories, drama, etc., on false imagination. They realize truth by hard study of vedas and ashtang yoga practice etc. Such dignitaries are always away from falsehood. They always are at present also away to waste time in spending fun/falsehood because vedas prohibits the same. Ancient as well as new rishis always obey vedas. They realize truth and god. So they speak truth, they listen truth, they observe truth by hard mind, mouth and deeds. The people who are always having time for back biting/spending fun etc., leaving far behind of listening vedas, or doing ashtang yoga practice, or making contacts with the learned acharya, or performing yaj, having sleep even after sunrise, eat non-veg., etc., do not serve the elders/parents, do not speak truth, are indulged in several diseases and family attachment etc.,, leaving behind the family duties, remain attached with TV, picnic, clubs, kitties, cinema, filmi songs, mostly take food from outside, etc., etc., etc., will sure pass the above comments on the rishis munis who were/are always away from any of the above quoted vices. One must be always alert with the life that the life is only meant to realize truth, remaining always in contact with learned acharya who knows vedas/ashtang yoga philosophy. How an illiterate person is able to understand a book on science/medical philosophy/engineering/mathematics etc., etc. So truth is god and god is known through vedas and further vedas are known with the blessings of learned acharya who knows vedas. So when people are lacking knowledge of vedas then automatically they are innocent having the effect of illusion. So what they listen they usually talk further without knowing vedas, which is an eternal truth. Can any person who knows vedas fully say the above statement that rishis write drama on imagination?

I am praying daliy to God to help us and help my husband of getting into something better position so that I can look after house and my child. Can you please suggest me something? I want to be close to GOD and have peace of mind as these thoughts are disturbing me and I cannot relax. All the time I just feel like only praying and asking help from GOD. I am just working forcefully as we cannot survive in one salary also I cannot think of another kid due to this situation. Can you help me in some remedy? I have gone through you site and believe me I have tried in many things to change myself. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> To become a religious lady is really a great achievement. The main motto of the human life is to realize god while discharging all moral duties. But a now a days it has become difficult to select the real path of worship to follow. There is a lot of worship in the world but still day by day corruption, problems. Sorrows, tensions, falsehood, difficulties, diseases, disputes in families, attachment, ego, anger, sins, etc., are increasing. I remember the ancient time of satyug, treta and dwapur where people were following the path of vedas and were experiencing peace, with all other benefits in family. So i would advice you to please start your pious day with reciting gayatri mantra and jaap of holy name "Om". Please try to listen/study vedas. It is very good that you do pranayaam and asan. But still the yoga philosophy is to be learnt. I have written some books on vedas and yoga philosophy, which have since been sent to you. Please study the same to get progress in religious life. We have to worship only one formless god, who creates, nurses and destroys the universe. So please study the books and try to know the almighty god. You may write your doubt on spiritualism frequently. One should minimize his expenses, it helps to pull on the expenditure well. When you're praying god then sure the financial problem will be over. But god helps those who help themselves. Therefore your husband must try to work hard to increase the income. I will advice you also that if possible you must perform havan daily even with gayatri mantra. A cassette of, how to perform havan with gayatri mantra may also be sent to you free of cost on demand, please. Your co-operation to earn money at this juncture is also appreciated. I hope in future your pious desire will be fulfilled by god. It is mentioned in Atharvaveda that one who leaves non-veg. He is forgiven by god. So I appreciate you. My blessings are always with you and your family.

Let every student sleep alone and never lose his reproductive element. He who loses it through passion breaks his vow of Brahmacharya. MANU 2: 177 - 180. Well here it is mentioned that brahmachari should not use umbrella... Well I don’t understand why? And what should I use then when it rains? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> you have read correctly stated above. Please follow the same. You're right. Now a days it has become difficult to follow.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Fundamental law of nature (God in vedas) are eternal and unchangeable. Carelessness will sure be punished by god. In the matter of eternal law no question of majority please, because there was, is and will ever remain one unchangeable almighty god the lord of universe, whose orders are unchangeable.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The benefits of peepal are several out of which a few are enumerated as under---- peepal controls air pollution, the fruit of peepal cures indigestion, the bark of peepla cures skin allergies, it also cures constipation, leprosy, cough, cold, asthama, etc., etc.

                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> What is the meaning of "Sanatan" and "Shashwat"?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The meaning of both words are eternal/everlasting/immortal, and which/who is never made by anybody, etc.

                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> What does "Brahm Mahurat" means? What are their qualities &amp; advantages?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Braham means Ved mantra and formless immortal god. Muhurat means time. This is the time of "usha-kaal", which starts from 4'o clock early in the morning for all. At this time to do the study of vedas and name jaap of God/meditation is the best and that is why it is called braham muhurat. This time is also useful for the health. Rigveda especially tells about the benefit of usha kaal. Rigveda 1/92/10 states that the person who is sleeping in usha kaal, time, the usha kaal minimizes his age. Therefore one must never be lazy and must awake early in the morning in usha kaal, to practise education/spiritual education, religious task etc., etc.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Please quote from where the above piece of mantra has been taken. When an aspirant starts havan/yagya or meditation he ties the scattered/duly spread shikha (choti) with the intention that he has controlled all his worldly desires/vrittis to worship god. Recently i have answered about the shikha which may please be seen on the web site.

                <b>S. Chimmanchod:</b> Was lord Hanuman really cathed the sun as in many books and hanuman chalisa? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No please being against the nature/unnatural. It may be a symbolic idea. If somebody like veer Hanumaan ji controls his five perceptions, five organs and mind by observing brahamcharya, and following the path of Vedas, practising ashtang yoga practice then he realizes god within him. God is a shape of immortal light. He gives the light to sun, moon etc., so it can be mentioned symbolically that such yogi when realizes The eternal/immortal light within him so he has grasped the sun. Otherwise physically it is quite impossible to grasp the sun with mouth.

                <b>Satyendraa:</b> What is importance of 'swar'-chandra &amp; surya? How it changes from left to right nostril? Why both of my swras functions whenever I go for bowing my head down in front of Mandir or any God's statue since last the few months?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> In several books there has been mentioned importance of swar chandra and surya. But in vedas there is only importance of pranayaam. Nose has two nostrils containing chandr and suyra nadi but in vedas chandr and surya nadi are not the names. There are ira and pingla nadi. One must do pranayaam which is a part of ashtang yoga.as regards changing of swar, if left sawr is to be changed then one must lie down on right side and vice versa. Function of both swars is not bad.

                <br> The persons who worship god according to vedas, their houses are always full of ghee, honey, pure water, milk and curd etc.

                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> What does "SANDHYA" means? Meaning of mantra "AAHRAHA SANDHYA UPAASIIT?"
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> sandhya =sam+dhyan i.e., to meditate properly. So one should recite the ved mantras which are full of praise, prayer, and worship, with full concentration. Aahaar means to take pure, vegetarian, digestible food. Upaasiit means to worship. However please quote the full mantra to give full explanation.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> What does "YAGYOPAVIT" or "BRAHMSUTRA"? Is it that only trained person can perform Yagya/Havan through Ved Mantra's or recites Gayatri Mantra? Can only listening to mantras through learned person or through audio tape benefit? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yajopavit is to wear janeyu. Brahmsutra is Vedanta Shastra. Listening of mantra from a learned person who knows vedas is eternal pious philosophy. Trained (learned) person is only entitled to perform and to compelte whole yaj. In vedas he is called brahma i.e., he knows the deep philosophy of four vedas. Audio tape can be listened to gain knowledge but not to perform yagya. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> How one must greet/welcome others? I find Namaste, Good morning, Good evening, Handshake unsuitable. If I am not wrong, NAMASTE means NAMAH = JHUKNA and TE = TERE LIYE, meaning I bow down for you. Namaste does not sound suitable if elder says to younger. Namaste sound okay towards God, Parents and Guruji only, but not others. Also Good morning/evening does not sound okay in all conditions of life. Hand shake I personally don't like, this for maintaining cleanness. What is the better method/word to greet/welcome everyone; I normally prefer using "JAI RAMJI KI" with every one, which sounds suitable in any condition of life.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Namaste is the best for all. Namh means to become namr i.e., polite/humble. So elders must always be polite before youngsters to preach/educate them and vice-versa. Namaste is the eternal word which is mentioned in vedas.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> What does "ARYA" or "ARYA PUTRA" means? Does it refer to any kind professional level or social group? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Arya who is follower of Vedas and is ever away from sins, etc. So it is said, "Aryah Ishwarah Putrah", i.e., such pure person is the son of god. And son of Arya is called Arya Putr.

                <br>
                <b>Kishor Brahmapurkar:</b>This is kalyug. Bhagwan Ram and Mata Sita had to suffer. Can in kalyug a mangal girl marry non mangal? Thanking you.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Bhagwan Ram and Mata Sita did not suffer. In this regard I have replied to someone recently which may please be seen on web site. Kaliyug is a stipulated time. It is non-alive. Non-alive matter can never harm alive. We are soul and we are alive. There is a law in Yajurveda mantra 7/48 that we are free to do pious deeds or sins but result is awarded by God, in the shape of happiness and sorrows respectively. So no questions of sorrows from kaliyug or any yug, please. It is our own deeds, pious/sins which we have to face. 
                <br>
                <br> To know the truth our ancient Rishis have advised to tally the matter with Vedas. Because in Vedas there is no mention of word manglik so you need not worry. The people who are not manglik are also suffering from the problems mentioned by you. Shri Ram married Sita after breaking the bow. And nobody saw Shri Ram’s teva or Anything. In Mahabhart Yudhisthar married Draupadi by piercing arrow in the eye of a fish (the eye was pierced by Arjuna the younger brother of Yudhisthar) and there was no teva and manglik etc. Savitri married Satyavan at her own wish and no teva or manglik etc. Pandu married Kunti and Madri without teva or manglik etc. Teva means janam patri made by pandit i.e., horoscope. So according to Vedas these are not required and self made story. So please do not worry about manglik etc. future is based on pious deeds, hard working towards a right path and God helps those who help themselves. The knowledge of Vedas emanates direct from God. So whatever, there is in Vedas that one is true/authentic. Our ancient Rishis like Patanjali in his yoga shastra sutra 1/7, have briefed that if the matter is not mentioned in Vedas as true one that will be considered unauthentic. As manglik matter/teva etc., is not mentioned in Vedas. So being unauthentic needs no consideration. Death etc., is always due to the result of past lives/present lives’ deeds and births and deaths are under control of God Himself. 
                <br>
                <br> Because we are free to do good or bad deeds but result is awarded by God. So for a long happy life one should always do pious deeds according to Vedas for a long happy family life even one should listen Vedas, perform havan/Yajyen and practice of yoga philosophy and follow only religious eternal path discharging all moral duties faithfully. God is not only meant for one or two race. He is for entire humans being and even for universe. So why other races do not accept manglik matter etc. So no question of fear please. However, good qualities to pull on happy life are required from both sides. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vishal:</b> My question is that the smritis says that a Parishad has to be formed if somebody has some serious doubt /dilemma regarding dharma. A Parishad constitute a person well versed in Yajur Veda, one from Rig Veda, one from Samaveda, one from Atharva, and last but not the least one who is knowing the Vedanga. There are 6 Vedangas, through which Vedas are known. They are like body parts through which Vedas has to be known. They are Seeksha:- which says How Vedas are chanted. Pratisakhya(Pratisakhya rules-Sandhi of words etc has to be followed by a disciple chanting Vedas) belongs to this.. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Shiksha says how many alphabets are there in Vedas and how the alphabets are chanted. This knowledge has been given by Panninni Muni in Varnocharann Shiksha. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vishal:</b> 2)Meemamsa- The philosophy part of Vedas. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There are six shastras - Yog shastra by Patanjali Rishi on ashtang yoga philosophy. Samkhya shastra by Kapil Muni on prakriti. Nyaay shastra by Maharishi Gautam on the subject tark, i.e., to come on truth with proof based on discussion. 
                <br>
                <br> Vaisheshik shastra by Maharishi Kannad on the subject of dharma i.e., dravya, gunn, karam, saamanya, vishesh and samvaay. Vedanta shastra by Vyas Muni on braham and Mimansa Shastra by Gemini rishi. 
                <br>
                <br> In Mimansa Darshan there is deep thought on Ved mantras. Its subject is dharam, which is known only by the study of Vedas. Therefore it tells about dharam and thoughts on Ved mantras, which further helps to understand Ved mantras. It also tells about holy yagya. It tells about salvation by doing selfless pious deeds and knowing ourself and God within ourself. Otherwise there is no any Swarg lok or narak lok in sky etc. Similarly. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vishal:</b> Nirukta- of which Yaskas' is the most famous. Nirukta describes the origin of sanskrit words from where a word is derived. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Nirukta by Yask muni helps in study of Vedas to know the meaning of Ved mantras. Nirukta contains the description of words of Vedas by Maharishi Yask. The words of Vedas which have been described in Nirukta are from Nighantu Granth. Its study helps a lot to understand Ved mantras. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vishal:</b> Vyakarana- Panini wrote it. But he too mentions about previous works, so he is NOT the first grammarian. Also, Patanjalis' commentary (Maha Bhashya) is very important. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Honourable Panninni Muni wrote two books on Sanskrit grammar: 
                <br> 1. Ashtadhayi 2. Mahabhashya. Ashtadhayi contains the sutras (formulae) of divine Sanskrit grammar. It has eight chapters that is why its name is Ashtadhayi. Every chapter has four paad. Therefore Ashtadhayi contains 32 paad and 3980 sutras. It is the most ancient Sanskrit grammar book. It is the most ancient Sanskrit grammar book. The Ashtadhayi was being read even in year 681. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vishal:</b> 5) Chandas - The verses of the Vedas have a variety of different meters. They are divided by number of padas in a verse, and by the number of syllables in a pada. Chandas (#2331; #2306; #2342; #2307;), the study of Vedic meter, is one of the six Vedanga disciplines, or "organs of the Vedas". Chando Manjari is one such good book. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Chhands are used in poetry. Saamveda mantras are too in poetry to sing. There are chhand containing 8 varnn, 11 varnn, 12 varnn, 14 varnn, 15 varnn, 17 varnn, etc., etc. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vishal:</b> 6) Finally Jyotisha:- the 27 stars which are part of the zodiac signs like Mesha (Aries) and all is mentioned in Vedas. The 28th star Abhijeet is also mentioned in Vedas. Which is not known to Astrologers of today The chaturmasya, and tithis (like Prathama) are mentioned in Vedas which are auspiceous days to start Yagya. Then my question is why Swami is against Astrology. In ancient India, nothing was secular (non-religious) and everything claims to be derived from Vedas. Do Swamiji hates equally all Vedangas or particular to this 6th Vedanga Jyotish? As a Vedic master do you not follow Seeksha, chandas , Vyakarana, Nirukta and pratishakhya rules? Are you against all Vedangas or only astrology ? if so why? If your holiness say you are against all Vedangas I dont want any reply. I accept that Swami is a Vedic shcolar who does not accept the seeksha, vyakaran and Pratisakhya rules. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Kindly quote Ved mantra about Jyotish mentioned by you as above. Thanking you. 
                <br>
                <br> The learned of Vedas never hates anybody even they do not hate his enemies because the learned has no enemy. But question and answer must be there to come on truth as is clear in Nayaay Shastra. Moreover if Vedanag and Varnocharann Shiksha, Vyakarann etc., are not studied then real meaning of the Ved mantra cannot be known. In Vedas there is no mention about present jyotish/teva/kundali/sarp yog etc., etc., please. Everything has not been derived from Vedas, nowadays please. Self made paths have also been told by Tulsidass ji as under---
                <br> Shruti sammat hari bhakti path sanjut birati bibek.
                <br> Tehin na chalhin nar moh bas, kalpanhin panth anek. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <br> Meaning: Tulsi states that there is an eternal worship based on Vedas, which gives us ascetism and factual knowledge. But the people are not following the path of Vedas due to attachment (attachment with materialistic, pomp and show and family etc.) And the people make their own new several paths of worship. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Chiranjib Patnaik:</b> When can I meet my guru, my only dream in life to meet him directly in sthul avasta, other wise my life has no meaning ,only on meeting him then he can satisfy my desire. Do you have the answer for this?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> According to Vedas the soul once separated from body cannot enter again in the same body. It is a fundamental law of nature. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>M:</b> I have not till date followed the Vedas. I have had meat and done other things against the Vedas. I have started believing in one God these days through a person of a different faith. However I choose to keep the name of God as the God so that there is no conflict. I also want to believe that yags are good but I might not be able to perform it because I am working. But one God and good deeds really motivate me.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The views of anybody has no value please if it is not according to the Vedas, shastras etc. Vedas is eternal knowledge direct from God. In Vedas there is only one God who is formless. He creates, nurses and destroy the universe. He is formless, omnipresent, omniscient, and the five senses, organs and mind are not able to realize him. With the help of perceptions, organs, mind when we listen Vedas, do yagya, do daily jaap and do ashtang yoga practice etc., while discharging our moral duties of family life etc., then only one becomes able to realize him. And in Vedas there are so many names of God but the best name is ‘Om’. You know your name, please. But other people do not know until you tell them. If some unknown people will tell your name made by them at their own, then it looks no nice. So please study Vedas to know the reality. God deeds are also mentioned in Vedas. The same can not be imagined by anybody else at their own. Because God is the only commander of the universe. God never forgive any sin, please. However God in Vedas has preached that sins are burnt when an aspirant do havan/yaj, name jap and ashtang yoga practice. Please refer to the article on Vedic philosophy for further information.

                <b>K:</b> If the there is truth about one God why do people sing about other super humans (humans with better nature- like Krishna in temples assuming that he is form when God is formless) attain moksha? Isn't that moksha against Vedas. I am asking, not because I don’t believe in one formless God but, I want to seek knowledge on this. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> It is due to the lack of eternal knowledge of Vedas please. To come to the truth, Vedas are our self proof. So Vedas says that avtar is not possible. Because God is almighty i.e., has all powers and needs no assistance to control, nurse and to destroy the universe etc. So to clear the doubt one must go to an acharya who is a complete philosopher of Vedas and yoga Philosophy and the aspirant must listen Vedas regularly. What happens that false prophets try to show that they know Vedas. And they make notes of some Ved mantras which suits them and that too in parts. Then they recite and tell false meaning to before the public doing acting as if they are the most learned of Vedas. On the other hand people do not know about Vedas and people accept the falsehood. In this connection Rishi Kapil in his Samkhya Shastra vide sutra 3/78 to 3/81, states that if there will be no alive yogi knowing Vedas and ashtang yoga then a self made tradition of blind faith will come in existence.

Naturally the children will become wise. Knowledge must be gained and spread. The worldly knowledge i.e., education in school, collage are being obtained by children, which is good. So in addition the spiritual knowledge must be given by parents and permanent contact with a learned acharya may be made to gain regular knowledge of Vedas/shastras.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> To know the truth our ancient Rishis have advised to tally the matter with Vedas. Because in Vedas there is no mention of word manglik so you need not worry. The people who are not manglik are also suffering from the problems mentioned by you. Shri Ram married Sita after breaking the bow. And nobody saw Shri Ram¡’s teva or Anything. In Mahabhart Yudhisthar married Draupadi by piercing arrow in the eye of a fish (the eye was pierced by Arjuna the younger brother of Yudhisthar) and there was no teva and manglik etc. Savitri married Satyavan at her own wish and no teva or manglik etc. Pandu married Kunti and Madri without teva or manglik etc. Teva means janam patri made by pandit i.e., horoscope. So according to Vedas these are not required and self made story. So please do not worry about manglik etc. future is based on pious deeds, hard working towards a right path and God helps those who help themselves. The knowledge of Vedas emanates direct from God. So whatever, there is in Vedas that one is true/authentic. Our ancient Rishis like Patanjali in his yoga shastra sutra 1/7, have briefed that if the matter is not mentioned in Vedas as true one that will be considered unauthentic. As manglik matter/teva etc., is not mentioned in Vedas. So being unauthentic needs no consideration. Death etc., is always due to the result of past lives/present lives’ deeds and births and deaths are under control of God Himself. Because we are free to do good os bad deeds but result is awarded by God. So for a long happy life one should always do pious deeds according to Vedas for a long happy family life even one should listen Vedas, perform havan/Yajyen and practice of yoga philosophy and follow only religious eternal path discharging all moral duties faithfully. God is not only meant for one or two race. He is for entire humans being and even for universe. So why other races do not accept manglik matter etc. So no question of fear please. However, good qualities to pull on happy life are required from both sides.

My Question is: Does the boy not avoiding his "Kartavya" or responsibility towards his parents the folks who brought him into this earth? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes he is avoiding his responsibilities and his worship will be of no use. However, if he is really a ascetic then he can take sanyaas with the permission of his parents. But yet he will have to manage properly his parents before sanyaas. I am telling you now a days mostly the worship is not according to true path of Vedas and is mostly professional, which is a sin.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Shri Parushuram was also a warrior and equal to god but he fought against the devils and against the injustice.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> So it is our own fault that we do not study Vedas with grammar. Secondly the few learned acharya are meant to give the true knowledge and it is the duties of all to go to them to gain knowledge. If people are not interested to gain knowledge then it is a great mistake/ fault of the people, which is being paid to be indulged badly in illusion and facing troubles, problems and sorrows etc. And the unlearned so-called pandits make fool the people, which must be avoided strictly. So people must go to the learned to listen Vedas to become learned. Then there will be no problem. So how worship performed by unlearned person can be considered a true worship.

                <b>Gaurav Mukherjee:</b> I had a thread ceremony when I was 13 years old but it made no effect on me I took it customary to shave my Hair, and other rituals without understanding a single meaning of it, I couldn’t understand the Purohit's words , but I remained the same as before no change took place in me and enjoyed receiving gifts from others invited tor Bhojon . A brahmin is known as "twice born" or "dwijo" when his thread ceremony is completed and he has a Sacred Thread, then something must take place in him to make a change within him with which he finds a new vision to life, I know mantras have their unique vibrations and meanings but without understanding them or get someone to help find the significance of them aren't they are useless, in this fast world? Please help me out I want to know what happens after a real pious and sincere Thread ceremony. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Not brahmin, but all are considered dwij if they get second birth froma spiritual master who knows Vedas. Dwij means the aspirant has been given diksha of gayatri mantra and Vedic knowledge, he has been asked to do daily havan by the acharya. He has to listen Vedas. He has to observe strict rules of Brahamcharya and daily routine of spiritualism. So only thread ceremony and too without Ved mantras will be of no use. One has to do hard tapsya while discharging family duties then only good results are obtained. For the same regular advice from learned acharya of Vedas is required. Ashtang yoga practice is Required. Then change will come.

                <b>Ashish:</b> How can you prove that intercaste marriages are not sin or adharma? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Because the caste have not been made by god. In four Vedas there is only mantras to give knowledge to the human beings. Within human body soul resides. Soul are having same qualities, i.e., in all bodies of living beings. Soul resides which are unlimited and are same based on qualities. But soul takes body according to his own good or bad deeds and faces happiness and sorrows based on his deeds which are awarded by god. The pandavas were dressed as brahmins in jungle. They were married in kshatriye family, etc., etc. But marriage must be based on good qualities of both sides say Vedas.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The dreams are mostly false. Dreams are based on the scenes, stories listened in previous life as well as in present life. Your father used to recite gayatri mantra, it is very good. So you must follow your father. You want to srudy Saamveda which is the best idea. Samveda is Upasana Kand and tells worship for one immortal formless god, who is almighty, omnipresent, omniscient. He creates, nurses and destroy the universe and again creates, Vedas say that no one was equal to god and neither no god took birth in the past at present and will never take birth in the future too. There was one god, is one and will ever remain one. He is only everlasting eternal and unchangeable king/lord of the universe. So we all must worship him only. In this connection advices from a learned acharya of Vedas is necessary. 
                <br>

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Your question is natural based on their life. But everything that glitters is not gold. You may see the life of Meera, Shri Ram, Mata Sita, Hanuman, Sugreev, King Harishchandra also, which was too full of struggles and so called sorrows. But Vedas like Atharvaveda mantras mentioned in kand 4 and sukt 34 &amp; 35. The mantras specially 2 &amp; 3 state that when a person attains/realizes knowledge based on Vedas/performance of holy yagya/ashtang yoga practice etc., in contact with learned acharya then they are always above the feelings of happiness and sorrows. Happiness and sorrows are always for those who are merged in illusion and thus are ignorant. That is why when Shri Ram was informed to sit on throne of Ayodhya he felt no happiness like ignorant being a learned of Vedas, and a complete yogi as mentioned by Valmiki ji in his Valmiki Ramayana sarg 1 of baal kand. And similarly when he was informed about exile he felt no sorrows. The above dignitaries like Yudishthir etc., mentioned by you had the same stage like Shri Ram because they were always under advices of Vyas Muni, Shri Krishna, Kripacharya, Dronacharya, and others. They used to do havan/yagya daily. They performed strictly Brahamcharya in life. They studied four Vedas.

                <b>Sagar Bhardwaj:</b> I would like to ask question which is causing too much trouble to my mind and soul. What according to you is the exact definition of time because I have read a book of relativity in which it is told that we can travel in time and space. Or that is there is no time everything is happening in the same time............. that is time is illusion. I have also read that everything that is time and space is been studied before by our Rishi and Munis and recorded the calculations in their books. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The idea of Rigveda mantra 1/95/6,7,8 is that human being must utilize every component part of the time of day and night to do pious deeds and not to do sins etc. At proper time the creation like sun, earth, moon is created. The time is great. Actually time is eternal. Rigveda mantra 1/164/11 states the kaal (time) is infinity and eternal. The time is powerful /mighty. Kaal (time) is neither born nor destroyed. There are five steps of kaal (time), those are---------Kshann (seconds), muhurat (moment/division of time), prahar (three hours period ), divas( day) and paksh(side, i.e., there are two paksh, krishna paksh and shukl paksh). The earth rotates on its axis, while revolving around the sun and takes one complete round, and generates day and night. It is called ahoratr. One ahoratr = 24 hours. So the calculation of time comes out accordingly. There is big detail of description of time in Vedas which cannot be explained here due to shortage of time. So every science etc., has already been mentioned by god in Vedas. One should learn Vedas to be a complete learned person. Vedas emanates from god, so Vedas like god are complete with knowledge in all respect. I have written some books on Vedas and can be sent if you desire.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There is a law in Yajurveda mantra 7/48 that we are free to do pious deeds or sins but result is awarded by god, in the shape of happiness and sorrows respectively. So no questions of sorrows from kaliyug or any yug, please. It is our own deeds, pious/sins which we have to face. There is no such mantra please. Our own deeds, hardworking towards right path make our future bright. If your love is true based on soul to soul and on good qualities, keeping behind mere physical charm then your efforts will make you able for reunion.

And if everyone is a sinner then what about the saying – whenever there is sin, I will come to get rid of sinners?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yajurveda mantra 40/8 states that god is "shukram" almighty, "akayam" i.e., bodiless, so does not take birth, "avrannam" holess and can not be converted into any part, so soul is also not a part of god "asnaviram" i.e., without nervous system etc., "apaapvidham" sinless and does not love to those who are sinners, "pari + agaat i.e., omnipresent, "kavihi" omniscient, "manishihi" knows thoughts of every soul "paribhuhu" who keeps behind the culprits/sinners "swayambhuhu" who is eternal/beyond death and birth/has no father, mother etc., "shaashvatibhyaha samabhyah" for eternal living beings, "yathatathyatah" with truth, "arthan" gives knowledge of all through Vedas, "vyadadhaat" preaches, "sah" he is god. All Vedas like yajurveda mantra 31/7 clarify that knowledge of Vedas emanates direct from god at the beginning of universe. So the qualities quoted above in respect of adorable almighty god are also eternal, unchangeable, and true. Conclusion of the mantra will automatically state that god never takes birth etc. So avtarvad is not possible please. As regards karmas yajurveda mantra 7/48 states that we are free to do pious deeds or sins but result is awarded in happiness or sorrows respectively by god. One must not depend on anybody that somebody will come to give salvation. The dignitaries like Shri Ram, Shri Krishna and Mata Sita etc., did hard deeds without wasting a second. So we must also follow their path to do the hard work towards right path. Please read the article on avtarvaad for more details.

Please try to do havan daily even from gayatri mantra, which is a great worship of God and will give you benefit. The meaning of kaal is also time. So death comes according to time for which the God has given life to us. This is all based on our previous lives' pious deeds and sins. So there is no effect of kaal sarp yog etc., in the life, but effect of deeds (karmas) only. So, one must do always pious deeds to be happy. Present pious deeds can burn our previous deeds also and life's time can also be extended wide yajurveda mantra 3/62.

Because at present there are so many sects and so many gurus to teach their own ways. However, bhakti is eternal. The eternal bhakti is only taught by only a dignitary who is also eternal and almighty. The said dignitary is only almighty God (preached in Vedas) who is formless, immortal, omnipresent, omniscient, creates, nurses and Destroy the universe. The God at the beginning of every universe gives the knowledge of four Vedas which is full of gyan kand, karam kand and upasana kand. My article on the philosophy of Vedas is placed on the website, which teaches that we must only worship one God who create the universe etc., after studying the philosophy of Vedas you may send your question.

To avoid the dreams one must listen Vedic preach and perform daily havan even from gaytri mantra.

                <b>Sagar Bhardwaj:</b> First of all, I would like to thank you for answering my query earlier as I felt honoured to get a response from such a huge personality. I would like to clear my doubt about Mahabharat. According to one the book it is said that Mahabharat took place in 3129 BC and when it ended Lord Krishan’s age was 125 yrs and 7 months and its been approx 5128 yrs have passed. My query is that what was the age of major players who took part in this war e.g. Yudhishtir, Arjun, Krishan, Duryodhan, etc. and is there any physical evidence (apart from written material) still present by which we can be sure of their presence. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Mahabhart war took place about five thousand and one hundred thirty eight years ago. About ages the calculation will have to be done and it will take long period. So being lengthy it is not possible for me to devote time. However it is clear that the name of above dignitaries mentioned by you were above hundred years of age because they used to adopt brahamcharya which makes the age long. I am writing a book Brahamcharya which must be read by all. It will be in hand within month. Shri krishna's age was about 125 years when he willingly left his pious body. The age of bhisham pitamaha is 172 years, at the time of war.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> As per Vedas avtar is not possible please. For every truth the main proof are Vedas, which are called self proof. Vedas state that after getting the knowledge form a learned acharya. When an aspirant performs yajna, does pious deeds, discharges his moral duties faithfully while the same he does practice of ashtang yoga and thus attains asamprgyat samadhi. At this stage of samadhi Almighty God becomes present within him. Saamveda mantra 944 states that at the stage of the asamprgyat samadhi within the yogi the preach of Vedas utters which comes with the mouth of yogi duly inspired by God himself. So the yogi at this stage can say, "I am Ganesh, I am Shiva, I have created universe and all must worship me etc., etc." because at this stage the words utters by the yogi are inspired by God himself and the words are direct from God. Secondly the souls who had got salvation may come back and take birth to guide the people. And after doing his job the soul goes back at his own to realize salvation. This is as per atharvaveda mantra 9/10/11. So within the soul of Shri Krishna Maharaj actually the words of God were uttered which are true. However, one must know that Yajurveda mantra 32/1 too says that there is only one formless God, who creates, nurses and destroys the universe. But his names are several according to his qualities. So Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Ganesh, Shiva are the names of God according to his qualities which I have briefed several times on this site please. Please check the site, otherwise send your question again.

                <b>Akhilesh:</b> Please make my confusion clear and please show me the right path for worshiping and please let me know for becoming free from the matter of life and death in this age of kaliyug i.e a person should go to the supreme after death specially in grihasta ashram how a student, a householder, and a retired person should reside to achieve this very important goal of life?

                <b>Akhilesh:</b> Even if a person is alcoholic, and an egg eater but not a meat eater, one of my uncle possess these qualities but while remembering God he becomes very emotional and tears come from his eyes while doing pooja. He never asks anything from God not even a single penny. Can he move to the God after the death so that he becomes free from the matter of life and death? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Vedas strictly prohibit non-veg and any kind of addiction. God is the purest and is away from all kinds of result of any karmas to face. So the aspirant is to become. God's stage is natural and eternal whereas aspirants have to achieve the same by doing worship etc. As regards, worship the same must be eternal according to the eternal philosophy of four Vedas which emanates direct from God. So the worship must not be self made. In this connection i usually quote a chopai from Ramayana:- "SHRUTI SAMMAT HARI BHAKTI PATH SANJUT BIRATI BIBEK. TEHIN NA CHALHIN NAR MOH BAS, KALPANHIN PANTH ANEK." Meaning--- Tulsi states that there is an eternal worship based on Vedas, which gives us ascetism and factual knowledge. But the people are not following the path of Vedas due to attachment (attachment with materialistic, pomp and show and family etc.) And the people make their own new several paths of worship. I would advice you to read my book Vedic Satsang Sangrah pt i &amp; ii and Bhagwat Geeta-a secret of Vedas. Thereafter you may send your doubt and even you may come here for further guidance if possible. Books can be sent on demand and on receipt of your postal address. The books will clear your all doubts.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> According to Vedas, no question of mixing please. Soul is separate and God is separate. As regards salvation (moksh), it is attained by Rishi/yogi/true saint when he is alive. And at this stage soul realizes God but soul is not mixed with God etc. Similarly according to Vedas transfer of power from a Guru to shishya is against the Vedas and therefore not true. One has to face the result of his own deeds.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> As stated in Yog shastra sutra 1/3 when a yogi attains asamprgyat samadhi he knows himself. That is, soul resides in human body and we all are souls and not body, but due to lack of braham gyan (Vedas' knowledge/ preach from a learned acharya) mostly people consider themselves a body. So here himself means soul knows himself. Secondly within soul God is there and the yogi too realizes God. The said stage is Called self-realization. In Vedas (Yajurveda mantra 7/4 and Yog Shastra sutra 2/29), there are eight fold paths of ashtang yoga to be practised under guidance of a learned acharya of Vedas and yoga philosophy. So meditation is a seventh stage of ashtang yoga. When aspirant reaches at this stage he concentrates well in God (chitan- manan of qualities of God etc.). At this stage the aspirant knows nothing about world or worldly affairs except himself and God. This stage is dhyan meditation). I have described the said stages including every sutra of Patanjal Yog Garshan in my book in Hindi. I would advice you to study my book which will give you full knowledge of ashtang yoga. Book can be sent on receipt of address if you so desire, please. The philosopher of Vedas loves human beings.

We all are brothers and sisters as we are children of one father? And one must strictly follow path of brahamcharya and mediation of God. Why this different point-of-view?

                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> Secondly, they greet everyone with "OM-SHANTI", and touching feet for blessing is not allowed in their system. When asked what does OM means to them, they said OM means Aatma, according to their greeting means "Aatma-Shanti". Also when asked why touching of feet not okay, they answered as we all are aatma's and children of one father God Shiv, we must only pray him, mediate on him, and take his blessings.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Hinsa means violence. That is, to cause harm to others by any means. And ahinsa means non-violence. There are so many kinds of hinsa which have been defined in my book Patanjal Yog Darshan with hindi vyakhya. So i would advice you to please study the book for detailed knowledge. In Vedas, the ahinsa is not applicable for warrior who fights against enemies to protect nation on base of truth only. Also it is not applicable to the administrators who punish the criminals, culprits, bad elements etc., to maintain peace and to protect the public.

Dev means 'yeh dadaati she devah' which means he who gives us something is dev. Mother gives us birth, father nurses us by means of money, food etc., atithi gives us knowledge, acharya gives us knowledge and salvation and God has given us every matter of universe like sun moon , water, air, earth etc., etc., to live upon therefore Taiteryopnishad shiksha valli ekadash anuvak states, devpitrikaryabhyam na pramaditavyam i.e. devand pitri karmas must not be over sighted due to carelessness/laziness/spending fun. (in these deeds brahmayajya, devyajya, daily hawan, listening of Vedas and services to old persons come.) Further Upanishad says 'matri devaha bhavaha pitri devaha bhavaha acharya devaha bhavaha atithi devaha bhavaha i.e., mother, father, atithi and Acharya must be considered devi devata and we must serve them. A question has been put forth by Janakacharya Gargi to Rishi Yagvalkya and others in Brihadaranyakopnishad (chapter 3 shloka 2) that how many Devtas are there. Rishi Yagvalkya answered that there are thirty-three Devtas, i.e., 8 vasus, etc., as sighted to you before.

You must be free from gastric trouble to get energy in the body. Take food which is digestible only. Always avoid fatty food. One must sit in the morning on an asan to remember God daily.

I believe any action has its effects and impact in some way or the other (negative or positive). Does mantras containing in other holy books of Hinduisms are ineffective, such as mantras &amp; ritual practices available in various puranas, etc. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Vedas contains mantras. Other holy granths contains sutras, shlokas, etc., the shlok etc., which is not in Vedas has been made by human beings and will have to be checked from Vedas about its truth. So true shlokas will give good effect and untrue will give bad result and it is but natural.

Even this technique has taught the Kaliyuga Society in a hard way that by love and charity one can lead happy life. But I also admit that due to this man-made system, several misleading belief systems have confused common man from the path of truth, which is very sad and very dangerous too. Please advice.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Rigveda mantra 1/164/39 states if a man does not follow the path of real worship like listening of Vedas, to perform yagya/havan, name jaap of God and ashtang yoga practice etc., and has not realized God then without doing such tapsya and thus without knowing God, mere/only study of Vedas will do nothing. On the said lines, Kapil Muni in his Samkhya Shastra Sutra 1/23 states that the preach, "Vaangmatram-----------" i.e., it is only to say and will not be able to realize the truth because such preach remains only in mind/chitt only. Then what to talk about other shlok etc. So one must try to do tapsya (practically) after gaining knowledge.

                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> I wonder if lord OMKAR (The Supreme) chooses the greatest MahaYogi's and create new Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh after destruction of the earth. And these three lords do their job of maintaining the balance of earth requirements. May be that is why he authorizes various God-Goddesses with certain powers and does all functions through them. Does this sound logically correct? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> God is called almighty. It means God has all powers so he requires no any assistance to control, create, nurse and destroy the universe etc. So Brahma, Vishnu are the names of the same formless almighty and omnipresent God. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> As lord OMKAR is not visible (formless), he does not appear in body form. Then what is the reason he does not want appear before us (human being). Why these hide and seek. Is there any secret that lord OMKAR does not want to us to know? What is the need of placing the soul into body really? That is why he is the powerful-soul and we are weak-soul, but both are souls of same kind but with huge quality difference. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> God is omnipresent so he is also in every soul. But soul being attached in illusion is not able to realize, otherwise every Veda says that God is originated/realized by a yogi in his heart when he attains asamprgyat samadhi. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> Finally it's fine to say that we must pray our father not their children's, not God creations but God who is source of all. How can one really have Darshan of lord OMKAAR? Which is said impossible in Vedas? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> This is only due to the lack of study of Vedas that we are unable to know the real qualities of God and his eternal fundamental laws about universe and human beings. I advice you to study my books like Vedic Satsang Sangrah pt i &amp; ii, Yaj Karam Sarvshersth Ishwar Pooja (all in Hindi). In Vedas it is clearly mentioned that brotherhood must be promoted in all human beings. Study of four Vedas from learned acharya, daily yaj/havan, and hard practice of ashtang yoga philosophy under guidance of an achartya who knows Vedas, makes aspirant able to realize God. Our ancient rishis munis, King Janak, Dashrath, Harishchandra, Shri Ram, Yogeshwar Krishna, Mata Sita, Madlsa adopted the Vedic path and so is the case of all ancient rishis.

                <b>Vikas L. Acharya:</b> Also would like your views on how all this confusion began in Hinduisms related to so many types of God and ritual practices?

How one should count them and in which order? What is the main subject matter of all these books in chorological order, please explain in an sequential orderly manner.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes please, there are six shastras written by six Rishis. These are--- Yog shastra, Samkhya, Vedanta, Mimansa, Nyayand Vaisheshik. Vedas are eternal, emanates direct from God. i.e., Vedas are direct from God and are originated in the heart of four Rishis at the time of beginning of the creation. That is why Yog shastra 1/26 states that God is the first Guru of our ancient four Rishis. There is fundamental law which is unchangeable too that knowledge is only gained by somebody if it is given by somebody. At the time of beginning of the earth there becomes no any Rishi muni alive of the previous creation who can give the knowledge. So God always gives the knowledge of four Vedas to four Rishis of unsexual creation. Thereafter Rishis recited Ved mantras and gave knowledge to others. In this process when the Rishis became learned after getting knowledge of Vedas then they wrote Valmiki Ramayana/shastras/Upanishads/mahabhart etc., based on the knowledge of Vedas. Now the saints have written spiritual books based on the knowledge of shastras/upanisads etc. However, Vedas are self proof being eternal knowledge from God. So in the spiritual books the matter according to Vedas is true. And against the Vedas untrue.

                <b>Neeraj K. Chauhan:</b>I heard from many persons that “Mantra Ucharan” is a very sensitive and sincere practice. Even a little mistake while “Ucharan” can cause you adverse and opposite results. But I want to ask that the Almighty God is the most knowledge full and omniscient in the world. Therefore, if a person is “Ucharing” some mantra for his betterment purposes and while ucharan, if, by mistake, he pronounce a little wrong mantra (while the spirit behind pronouncing the mantra is remain the same) but the God himself know that even if my any disciple has pronounced some wrong mantra but the spirit behind ucharan is same, then how he can got the adverse effect/result? Nutshell, prayer is matter of devotion not a matter of business like give and take, therefore, how the results of prayer for betterment can be adverse?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Can anyone say that pronunciation of English, Hindi, Marathi, Urdu or any language is easy? You see everybody has to learn the language first. However, the pronunciation of Sanskrit is not difficult being mother tongue. But it is sad that in case of Sanskrit language mostly the people avoid to learn the same for one reason or the other. This has damaged our Indian culture. The Indians must be alert now to save the culture which is mostly in Sanskrit language. Question of adverse and opposite result does not arise if we learn the language faithfully.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Every date and time which suits you is good. Because date and time have been made by God himself. So the same are always pious. Suppose one does sin then due to his bad deeds the day and time is bad. And if he does pious deeds then his date and time is pious. So pious and bad date and time is according to deeds.

The paths are yam, niyam, asan, pranayaam, pratyahaar, dharnna, dhyan and samadhi. I have written a book on yoga philosophy, which can be sent to you on demand please. The book contains detailed philosophy of Ashtang yoga. The yoga philosophy is always learnt from an acharya in person please. It is easy and not difficult for those who desire to learn the same.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> My heartiest blessings to you my daughter on the eve of Gurupurnima. Actually its original name is Vyas Purnima. Ved mantras are also called Shruti. Shruti means which are heard. You already that at the time beginning of universe the mantra emanates direct from God and are originated in the heart of four rishis. So Vedas are not book. It must be listened still. A time came when while learning the Ved mantras by heart the mantras were mixed with each Ved, i.e., Rigveda mantras with Yajurveda and Yajurveda mantra with Saamveda etc., it became difficult to know as to which Ved ends with which mantra. During Mahabhart time Vyas Muni ji who knew the Ved mantras wrote the Vedas on bhoj patra. And made separation from each Vedas. I.e., Vyas muni ji wrote every Ved separately. When he finished the pious job, the day was purnmasi/purnima. Vyas muni were writing the Ved mantras in a lonely place and the disciples were waiting for his darshan. Vyas muni ji gave his darshan on purnima, i.e., after the completion of the pious job. Since then the day is being called Vyas purnima and all the disciples did pooja of the greatest Rishi Vyas on the said pious day. So this is the day for those who are lovers of Vedas. You may purchase Hindi calendar, "panchang". As regards blasts in Bombay, it was really a sad and heart broken news.

We have to give regards to first four to please them and worship of Almighty God. non-alive Devtas are eight vasus (agni, vaayu, jal, aakaash, prithvi, nakshtr, chandrma and surya, eleven Rudra (10 prann + alive soul), twelve Aditya i.e., 12 months, vidyut and Prajapati (Yagya). Non-alive are not worshipable. Only one Almighty God who creates, nurses and destroy the universe, is to be worshipped.

This is also mentioned in bhagwat geeta shlok 3/15 --- KARAM BRAHMODBHAVAM VIDDHI, BRAHAMAKSHAR SAMUDBHAVAM i.e., karmas emanate from Vedas and Vedas emanate from God. So to do karmas, according to the Vedas, is our duty (kartvya). And while doing such karmas when a person does hard working with whole hearted that hard working leaving behind the laziness is called purusharth. Because God helps those who help themselves.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> As told above one must learn Vedas and ashtang yoga philosophy in practice. When five perceptions and five sense organs and mind are thus controlled then he must preach the others.

                <b>Yogita:</b> I want analysis of karma, akarma, and vikarma which are explained by gita rahasya and also the concept of viveka, aviveka, knowledge of virtue, and analysis of weakness by gita rahasya.

                <br>
                <br> So to do karmas according to Vedas are karmas and the karmas (deeds) which are done against the Vedas are vikarma. Some deeds are natural for example, laughing, sleeping, eating, etc. When a person is entangled with only the natural deeds i.e., eat, drink, be merry etc., then the karmas are called akarm. When a person is entangled with laziness, intoxication etc., and oversights the hard working and only does natural deeds then the deeds are called called akarm. Vivek means true understanding i.e., to know the factual stage between truth and untruth, alive and non-alive etc. Avivek is its opposite. Knowledge of virtue is attained by listening Vedas, making contact with learned persons. Daily worship of God/havan and practice of ashtang yoga. Analysis of weakness is stated above which is laziness etc.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No please there is no any significance of numbers. It is according to time which suits a person. It may be hundred or more even. It is not necessary that before gayatri no mantra can be chanted. Every Ved mantra, however, is started from the holy name of God i.e., Om. And it is also better if we praise, worship and pray God reciting gayatri mantra before chanting Ved mantra. It has been tradition of our ancient rishis munis also.

His hobby towards computer etc., are to be changed and indulged in studies. Students have only two subjects-to take care of health and study hard. For the same students require preach. So problem is that who will give him preach because no student is ready to surrender his bad thoughts since he thinks that he is going towards right path which is wrong.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Ramayana and Mahabhart epics are not fictitious. We must know that dramas/ stories/film stories/poems on worldly matters etc., are written by ordinary men, most of them takes wine, meat, cigarettes etc., but since the time of creation-uptil now no any Rishi Muni, tapsvi has written any drama, stories etc. Rishis, Munis, Tapsivis have written always true holy books. Yog shastra sutra 1/6 states about five chitt vrittis i.e., pramaaan, viparyay, vikalp, nidra and smriti. So Patanjali Rishi says about viparyay in sutra 1/8 ---
                <br> VIPARYAYO MITHYAGYANAM-ATADUPAPRATISHTHAM. 
                <br> i.e., out of them viparyay vritti is that which states about false knowledge. For example-in some light and some darkness a rope from a distance is considered a snake. So the knowledge in a rope of snake is false. Now see about vikalp. In this connection Yog shastra sutra 1/9 states ---
                <br> SHABADGYANANUPATI VASTUSHUNYO VIKALPAH
                <br> i.e., Vikalp is that vritti which is based on a story comprising of words-sentences only. But actually the matter for which the story has been told or written is, in fact not there. i.e.., that the mater which is not liable to be known is called Vikalp. For example some body says that he has seen bow made of hare's horn, you will see that hare's has never horn on its head. So the sentence comprising of words stating that somebody has seen a bow made of hare's horn, is false. As no such bow is there on earth. 
                <br>
                <br>Now Patanjali Rishi in Yog shastra sutra 1/12 states ---
                <br> ABHYAASVAIRAAGYAABHYAAM TANNIRODHAH. 
                <br> i.e., by doing hardf practice of ashtang yoga and study of Vedas etc., when a Rishi becomes ascetic then he becomes able to burn all the said five chitt vrittis in the fire of knowledge, because the vrittis are always harmful for every human being and are obstacles to become an aspirant a true person or to realize God. Now we come to the point that Vyas Muni was a complete Yogi and a true Rishi. So he cannot write any fictitious book, because Rishis Munis have no such time and their vrittis are not either Viparyaya or Vikalp. Vyas muni ji wrote Mahabhart holy epic which is true one. So is the case of Rishi Valmiki ji, who was also a comlete Rishi, muni, Yogi, etc. And he has written a great and holy true book named Valmiki Ramayana. However, I would like to tell about Mahabharat that it has only 10,000 shlokas written by Vyas Muni ji which are true. Uptil now, Mahabhart has about one lakh twenty thousand shalokas i.e., about one lakh ten thousand shlokas are fictitious which have been added.

Shri Ram had top class engineer named Nal and Neel, who made the bridge with the help of army of King Sugreev etc. being lengthy subject I cannot tell here more. However, Valmiki ji says in Ramayana that Ling Sugreev gave him a small aeroplane which had the facility of lading at any small place even.

                <b>Tejash:</b> What is the intention of God behind bringing Kalyug on earth and why did the Kalyug start? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Similarly if we say that what is intention to bring satyug? Actually God has no intention. This is man who has god or bad intentions. If a man does good deed then the day comes when he is awarded result of his good deeds in the shape of happiness and if he has done bad deeds then result is awarded to face sorrows. Therefore satyug or kalyug, treta or dwapur has nothing to do with good/bad --- happiness/sorrows, etc.

Is there any other God to do the same deeds. No doubt there are so many self made Gods and they must be asked to create the universe. In Yog shastra sutra says that if anybody desires to realize God, prakriti helps in his way. And if anybody cheats then prakriti give as him houses, assets and all valuable articles of the world to enjoy and destroy him badly, i.e., so called Gods, in their present lives', also are facing several diseases and problems.

Suppose in your luck there is no education then this blame will sure go to God, which is quite impossible. Vedas says that future is in our hands. One must do hard working towards right path to make his future bright. So please go ahead, your hard working will prove that you have a lot of education. Vedas do not tell about horoscope.

So it is clear that you are not body, eye etc. So in Vedas and afterwards our Rishis in shashtras have clarified that O! man or woman you are immortal soul. You have been blessed by God especially with human body to do pious deeds, worship, yoga practice and Yagya etc., to realize God within you.

                <b>AFTER DEATH</b>
                <br> Yajurveda mantra 3/55, says, " DEVAIYAH JANAH NAH PUNAH MANAH DADATU" i.e., by blessings (preach and true education of Vedas) may learned Acharya give us next birth of human being. So that we may again be able to learn the truth of Vedas and to get salvation. So one must always adopt true path by which he gets rebirth of human being to continue the real spiritualism to get salvation etc., because Atharvaveda mantra 9/10/16 further says that human being who has done pious deeds and adopted true path they get pious human body in the next birth, otherwise soul gets the lowest/contemptible body, like animals, birds etc. 
                <br>
                <br> Mantra is
                <br> APAANG PRAANGETI SWDHAYAA GRIBHITAH AMARTYO MARTYENAA SAYONIHI. 
                <br> TA SHASHVANTA VISHUCHINA VIYANTA NYA NYAM CHIKYURN NI CHIKYURNYAM. 
                <br>
                <br> Soul according to its good or bad (APANGETI) takes bodies of animals, birds, insects etc., and (PRANG) bodies of Rishis, Munis, i.e., (uuch Yoni) best bodies after leaving the present body, the soul (SWDHAYAA GRIBHITAH) duly attached with its own power of taking birth according to pious deeds and sins, enters other bodies (AMARTAYAH) though the soul is away from death being immortal but after death of bodies, takes new bodies. These ideas of Vedas has very well been mentioned in Bhagwat Geeta shlok 2/20 wherein Yogeshwar Shri Krishna says( AJO NITYAH SHASHWATOAYAM PURAANNO NA HANYTE HANYAMANNE SHARIRE ) i.e., the soul is (AJAH NITAYAH SHASHWATOH) never takes birth and is eternal (NAHANYATE HANAYMANNE SHARIRE) in fact after death of body too soul is never dead being immortal. (TASHASHVANTA) this process of death and birth of bodies and souls is eternal. (VISHUCHINA VYANTA) soul and bodies goes far away to different directions [soul goes to Savita etc., {given below} according to Yajurveda chapter 39 and then takes birth and get another bodies and five elements of bodies goes to space and are mixed within air, fire etc., according to Yajurveda mantra 40/15] (ANYAM NICHIKYHU) many learned knows about this fact (ANYAM NICHIKYHU) another who are lack of knowledge of Vedas do not know the fact, i.e., we mostly know our body but not ourselves, i.e., soul. Death is sure i.e., the body will have to be cremated one day. 
                <br>
                <br> In Atharvaveda mantra 8/8/11 'Yamdut' means= 'YAM' means God, and 'dut' means storm, cyclone, flood, earthquake, heavy rains, etc., etc., in mantra the air is Yam. So when a soul is to leave a body then by the power of God sutratma air enters the body and takes the soul out of it then goes to Savita, etc. In 39th chapter of Yajurveda the process of this cremation is mentioned. This process is also called as "NARMEDH YAJYEN", "PURUSH MEDH YAJYEN" and "DAH KARAM" and "ANTEYESHATI KARAM". Atharvaveda mantra 10/8/26 says "YEH CHAKAR SAH JAJAR" means He (God) who makes the body, He destroys the same one day. Sense of Yajurveda mantra 39/5 is that when the soul leaves the body then the soul wanders in so many places, takes another body according to its previous deeds (karmas). Yajurveda mantra 39/6 says that the soul after leaving the body first day goes to Savita (sun), second day agnihi (fire), third Vaayu (normal air), fourth Aditya, fifth chandrma (moon), sixth ritu (seasons), seventh marutah, eighth brihaspati (tiniest air), ninth mitrah (breathing), tenth varunah (udan air), eleventh indrah (electricity), twelfth Vishvedevah (in all divine qualities). Then after wandering in sky gets body according to previous deeds. So these twelve days are completed, then after 13 days the soul takes another body. Rigveda mandal 10 sukta 135 says that normally soul after getting body faces the result of its past lives' deeds and under influence of illusion (duly attracted towards illusion) does sins and again gets birth to face the sins. The soul is immortal and always separate from body. When an aspirant meets with a learned Acharya and gets spiritual education, then the fourth mantra says that the soul gets salvation.

Please also learn ashtang yoga philosophy. God is realized in asamprgyat Samadhi.

                <b>Rajanjit Singh:</b> My astrologer has said that I should worship a particular Ishta devata to get rid of the malefics that could afflict me in my life. Uncontrollable anger is one of the doshas observed and pointed out by the astro-expert. I wonder how the worship of Hanumanji can set-off this defect. Secondly can girls and women also worship Hanumanji by reciting his mantra or chalisa or sankatmochan hanuman ashtak? Kindly advise to clear my doubts so that I can purposefully direct my energies in the correct perspective.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> According to Vedas the meaning of Isht are several but according to mantra some of are:
                <br> 1. Ishtaha - to whom we desire (Saamveda mantra 151). 
                <br> 2. Pra Ishte - commander/master of the universe i.e., God (Rigveda 5/87/3). 
                <br>
                <br> So mostly the meaning of Isht is God or to do pious deeds i.e., yaj etc., so Isht of all human beings is one, i.e., God who creates, nurses and destroy the universe. He is formless, omnipresent, omniscient etc. We must worship him under advice of a learned acharya who knows Vedas and yoga philosophy etc. However, Shri Hanumann ji was a great yogi. He studied Vedas and did ashtang yoga practice. He was a great warrior and is also adorable. So you must perform daily havan from gayatri mantra, must chant gayatri mantra both times within heart on sidhasan, and must learn some asan, pranayaam and meditation, please. All this must be learnt by a local acharya, who knows Vedas and ashtang yoga philosophy. I am away and cannot teach you. 
                <br>
                <br>Men, women and girls have been worshipping the above formless God in every universe, like Mata Sita, Janak’s acharya Gargi etc. Worship is applicable for all. However, the good qualities of Hanumann ji like his brahamcharya, study of Vedas and faithful towards services etc., must be gained by all.

                <b>Nitesh:</b> Please sent me information on what’s all story of war between devils and devta for amrit kalash/water. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Amrit means immortal. So when any yogi realizes himself i.e., (soul), he realizes that his soul is immortal but based on deeds gets bodies (birth). Secondly he realizes God and God is also immortal. So there is no any liquid or other matter by taking of which body or soul becomes immortal. So the stories are against the Vedas. Because sur realizes soul/attains salvation by worship of God only and asur (rakshas i.e., who do sins) have no concern to fight with sur (devta, who do pious deeds according to Vedas) for any amrit which does not exist in the universe. And how asur snatch tapsya of sur? Everybody says that pious deeds or tapsya is important and nobody can snatch.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> This is all due to the desires. Desire must be spiritual as well as about moral duties to fulfill based on Vedas. People are not listening Vedas and are not attached with spiritualism, so at present the desires even baseless desires are developing. Satisfaction is the best way which is achieved by spiritualism i.e., by listening Vedas from a learned acharya, doing havan/yaj, and practising ashtang yoga philsophy. Contact with learned acharya makes man learned and give peace. Desires are like aahuti of ghee in burning fire, by which the flames are originated more and more. So when even one desire is fulfilled then more desires are generated and makes man to fulfill them even to take loan etc., etc., and etc.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> This is your desire that your son must be obedient. But it is not possible that every desire of persons be fulfilled. Deeds are done by us but result awarded by God. In your case also you and your son are facing the result of your previous lives' deeds. However deeds can be burnt with knowledge and then good result is obtained. So good preach from a learned person is required to your son and daily worship i.e., havn/yaj, naam jaap of God is essential to pray God to solve problem. So in your, my or everybody's problem what God will do. He is Almighty and Supreme Judge. He awards the result of our deeds only. So kindly never think about God as you have told above. Otherwise it will be a sin. God has given us all the worldly matters, life and goods etc. He is our Father. He is creator of the universe. He nurses and destroys he universe and gives punishment to the defaulters. So how even in a dream can anybody blame him? He commands on the universe including us. How anybody can command on him?

                <br> MANUSHVDAIIVYAMASHTAM POTA VISHWAM TADINVATI. 
                <br> Meaning: 
                <br> The devta of this mantra is Agni. Here in this mantra agni means God. Yasmin = which, yajesya = of yaj, netri = leader, i.e., sun, because sun leads the universe. Sapt = seven, rashmayah = rays of sun, i.e., sun has rays comprsisng of seven colours, atataaha = expanded. 
                <br>
                <br> Idea: 
                <br> Yasmin yajesya, here yaj means to make contact or to unite, so the rays of sun have to make contact with the world. Therefore yajesya means the world to which the rays have to make contact. Netri i.e., the sun leads the universe for which sun expands its rays comprising of seven colours. 
                <br>
                <br> Manushvat = like man, devyam = divine rays, ashtmam = eighth, i.e., God. The sun spreading rays comprising seven colours. And eighth is God who creates sun. Pota = to purify, i.e., sun purifies the world. Vishwam = all world, i.e., sun enlightens the whole world. Tat = the sun is, invati = prevaded by God. 
                <br>
                <br> Like man means --- man constructs house, pots, sceneries, electricity, etc., and thousands of other articles based on engineering, similarly God has created whole world including sun. 
                <br>
                <br> Meaning: 
                <br> The rays of sun comprising seven colours have to make contact with the world to purify and enlighten it. Thus the sun leads the world, for which sun expand its rays. 
                <br>
                <br> The eighth is God, who like man, creates the universe including sun. 
                <br>
                <br> Remarks: 
                <br> Here example of man to make worldly article stated above has been given by God himself in the mantra. So it does not mean that man is above the God. God is supreme and can give any example. God has given this example so that we may understand the idea of creation easily. Because man makes jewellery, artificial fruit, sun, moon in movies, etc., etc., etc., so it is very easy to understand that similarly the God first creates the universe, unsexaul creation in the shape of man and woman etc., and then man makes articles with the help of Vedas.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> All about ratan is not mentioned in Vedas, please. However, sun and moon etc., affects our life, sun bath is good for health. The crops are ripened with rays of sun, rain occurs due to sun, so we are alive due to sun, etc., etc., etc. Similarly moon gives juice to the vegetables and is beneficial to health if we sit in the night under the rays of moon. So planets are beneficial for us automatically as per law of God, but planets are non- alive element and are not worshipable etc. We have to worship only one God who creates, nurses and destroys the universe.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Soul is alive matter and immortal whereas the body and its organs are non-alive matters and will be destroyed one day. Soul is separate and body-organs are separate. For example-if in the night electric bulb gives light and we do our job in the light, but bulb has nothing to do with our job etc., similarly when soul is in body then body and its organs function. When soul is out that everything becomes dead. However, acupressure system, I think, is not harmful.

                <b>Anonymous:</b> My question is how to make your will power strong. I struggle with overeating since my mother has passed away with brain cancer at the age of 60. It was unexpected and my body got a very great shock and since she is gone I struggle with depression and eat a lot. My mind is always focused on eating. I know it is wrong but not getting enough will power to change my habits. I just can't make a routine for yoga and eat right. I do it for few days and then give up and then I start again and then I give up. It has been four years how do I become strong minded? Please help me. Although since I have found your website, I spend lots of time reading your articles whenever I am depressed. Your website helps me a lot. I really want to thank you but please tell some practical ways to be more determined. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> One should have firm decision. For example: Bhisham Pitamaha vowed not to marry and not to be a king of India and he stood by it. Secondly in this connection you need Vedic preach from an acharya for which you must try your level best. You must do daily hard practice of asan, pranayaam and meditation which will give you mental as well as physical energy. I think you will be waking early in the morning walk and light exercises. Human life is invaluable and must not go in vain. You must get medical advices also immediately. Please be brave and face the situation happily i.e., without tension. Atharvaveda mantra 8/1/7 states - that one should never worry to think always about death. Death must be overcome by getting knowledge from Vedas. Next mantra says that we must not weep for those who have passed away. If you'll do so then you'll also meet with an early death. You must follow the path of knowledge and must always discharge your moral duties faithfully. Atharvaveda mantra 8/1/10 tells don't follow the path of death of your elders but overcome the death. It is very dangerous to remember the persons and their death, who have gone heavenly abode. So please follow the eternal knowledge of Vedas and be happy. My daughter, why are you shocked by your mother's death? It is not unnatural because death and birth is under control of God, based on our deeds. Can you tell me any house of a person in which death did not occur and any old people whose mother has not gone or will not go to heavenly abode? So please follow Vedas path. Practice makes man perfect but the practice must be pious and according to Vedas. If you'll be practising the above said habit (i.e., practice of asan etc., and eating as well as leaving) so it will be a danger habit also because you're doing practice of the same. Please beware. So you must do good practice of daily havan, meditation, name-jaap and practice of yoga philosophy. Then all will be okay. Please send your postal address to enable me to dispatch spiritual books and cassettes on Vedas, the study of which will help a lot. The books will be sent free of cost.

                <b>Ashook Uppal:</b> When we get salvation what is the feeling of salvation? I mean can we go anywhere in the universe or we feel peace and bliss? And my next question Swamiji is there are several ways of doing meditation and all of them will take us to salvation and can we do meditation sitting on the chair because I can’t sit on padmasam or suhkasan etc. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Salvation means permanently merriment but it is attained first by listening knowledge of Vedas deeply from an acharya, daily havan/yaj, name-jaap and practice of ashtang yoga. The result of the said worship, is even awarded by God and a yogi attains Asamprgyat (Dharmmegh) Samadhi. At this juncture the yogi realizes God and feels utmost permanent divine merriment/peace/bliss. Merriment means the experience of realizing God. So a person must do the said worship and why to waste time to enquire other questions please. It is not the eternal/ traditional way to meditate on chair. Our rishis munis always did asan on earth and Geeta also states the same. It is better to follow the path of eternal philosophy of Vedas please.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The souls who after attaining salvation always remain in space and get experience always of merriment under the blessing of God/duly indulged with God. Such souls only meet with a present yogi who attains Asamprgyat Samadhi. Yog shastra sutra 3/32 states that yogi sees the souls who have already got salvation like Hanumann ji, Vyas Muni, etc.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> My blessings to you all. Muni = who study the Vedas deeply. Rigveda mantra says Manurbhav i.e., everybody must think deeply on Ved mantras and on any points to know the truth. Rishi means mantradrishta i.e., he who by studying Vedas and practisng ashtang yoga philosophy attains Samadhi and sees Ved mantras within him. Guru = who preaches but overall he who has done tapsaya etc., and has true knowledge of God, and loves the human beings and has no greediness about money etc. He can only preach well. Gayatri mantra has three main subjects i.e., stuti, prathana and upasana, and completes the worship of God when it is recited. If possible the meaning of Gayatri mantra already exists on the site, may please be read. Gaytri is a chhand and has twenty four so it is called Gayatri mantra. Every mantra is revealed in the heart of a Rishi when he attains Asamprgyat Samadhi by the grace of God. No please, Gayatri chalisa is not a part of Vedas, but everybody can recite or perform Yagya from Gayatri mantra by reciting the same forty times for forty days in a Yagya.

                <b>N. S. Venkateshwaran:</b> In many books and websites, it is mentioned that a major portion of the Vedas have been lost from man. Like it is said that there were originally 21 different shakhas of Rigveda of which only one shakha survives today. Out of 107 shakhas of Yajurveda only 5 are known to us now. Out of 1000 original Samaveda shakhas today only 3 or 4 survive. It is also said that sound of the Vedamantras are always there in the nature and saints of the Vedic period were able to know about them through tapasya etc. Today, is it possible for anyone to again realise the lost portions of the Vedas through his tapasya and reveal the knowledge contained in them to the mankind again? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> This is not true, please. However, whatever the the knowledge is available in Vedas if we listen carefully the same only and do daily havan/Yagya and practice of ashtang yoga philosophy under the instructions of a learned acharya then the Ved mantras originated still in the heart of a Yogi. So we must do practice as stated without wasting valuable time of life. Atharvaveda mantra 9/6(1)/1&amp;2, it is clarified that Vedas are originated within a Rishi. And Rishi is made by God himself on the basis of his knowledge of Vedas and stage of Samadhi as mentioned in Atharvaveda mantra 4/30/3, so we must be aware of self-made Rishis.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Bhranti means misunderstanding. Bhranti is always arisen due to illusion. Illusion is due to lack of knowledge of Vedas and spiritual holy granths. When an aspirant listen the preach of Vedas then it acts like a sun. When sun rises, the darkness of the night is over. Similarly when knowledge of Vedas is gained in mind then illusion/darkness is over. If you please quote any story of bhranti then will try to clear the same with knowledge of Vedas. No please kundalini has no reference in Patanjali's Yog shastra. I have written a brief commentary on each sutra of Patanjal Yog Darshan.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> In Atharvaveda mantra 9/9/2, 3, the Sapt Rishis are two eyes, two ears, two nostrils and mouth(tongue). Otherwise alive/ancient rishi is he who studies Vedas, does yagya and after hard practice of ashtang yoga attains Asampargyat Samadhi and sees the Ved mantras within him.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There is a wave now a days to do asan and pranayaam and mostly the saints are earning money for the same. But in my view this all is harmful. Even in four Vedas there is no mention of such huge asans and pranayaam. The proof is Vedas and six shastras. Vyas Muni in his comments on Patanjali Yog Darshan sutra 2/46 (Sadhan Pad) has advised padamasan, virasan, bhadrasan, swastikasan, dandasan saupashreya, paryank, kraunchnishdan, hastinishdan, ustrnishdan, samsansthan, sthir, such asan and yatha sukh asan. Secondly Vyas Muni in sutra 2/49,50,&amp;51 states that when perfect attainment on asan (asan siddhi) is achieved then pranayaam is done, i.e., now the breathing system is easily stopped . There are three types of pranayaam --- 1. Bahya, 2.Abhyanter, 3. Stambhvritti and when out and inner subjects are left then it is called fourth pranayaam. Rishi Patanjali as well as Muni Vyas in Yog shastra sutra 2/52 clarify that the pranayaam is only done to burn the illusion. And asans are done to begin the pranayaam. Patanjali Rishi and Vyas Muni say that when an aspirant needs no efforts to do asans and have attained the stage to concentrate mind/ chitta in Almighty God and asan are done easily automatically then it means the aspirant has got perfection in asan (asan siddhi). Now both the Rishis conclude that asan and pranayaam are meant only to realize God and not to get good health or to finish the diseases etc. So mostly the present saints are earning the money and I think they have diverted the attention of people towards false health and have uprooted the real eternal knowledge of ashtang yoga philosophy, the aim of which was only to realize God. So it is very dangerous stage of the world. Yajurveda mantra 7/4 (and all Vedas) says "UPYAAMGRIHITAH ASI, URUSHAYA MAGHWAN SOMAM PAHI ANTAH YACHH" i.e., O! aspirant you have to do ashtang yoga practice, do pranayaam, and attain assets of yoga philosophy/salvation. So in Vedas and shastras there is no mention to do asan or pranayaam to attain good health. Good health will automatically when you will do hard practice of ashtang yoga i.e., Yam, niyam, asan, pranayaam, pratyahar, dharna, dhyan and Samadhi. Atharvaveda says that if anyone will steal little bit portion of yoga/Vedas knowledge then I will crush him by feet and will thus give them death punishment. I.e., for example a rat cuts a little bit portion of shirt and takes away the same then it is clear the rat has taken little bit portion not shirt in full. So is the case of ashtang yoga and Vedas knowledge. The most of present false yoga teachers who are against the Vedas have started teaching a little bit ashtang yoga portion (mainly asan, pranayaam, and meditation and even against Vedas and yoga shastra) to give them temptation of health etc. , whereas our Indian wrestlers have/had good health by doing Indian exercises, so we must not kill our eternal culture.

                <b>Vikas:</b> Suppose after some centuries, we are able to create another life in an isolated planet, which have no connection with the earth. That place will be very similar to earth. Creatures created by us will be reproduce, will struggle for being alive, will live in groups n share different types of emotions with each other. One will be able to create a small world of illusion (means it won’t be having any reality). It will be done just for fun by any individual. That individual will be having full control over the destiny of each and other creature residing at that place. Now can you differentiate between the God which you worship and the individual who created this illusion world? He will be God for those creatures. What is the difference between them with respect to us and creatures of that isolated planet? If there is no difference then why God is great? Why love him? He is just playing a game.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Every planet has connection with earth, please, even each other. Almighty God has no desire. He has unlimited supreme qualities amongst which he is Anand Swaroop (shape of merriment though he is formless). So, why he will play game? Secondly no one spread the illusion. The universe is made of prakriti which may be called illusion. Prakriti has three gunas i.e., raj, tam and sato gunas. These gunas has quality of anger, sensuality, greediness, pride, etc., etc. Human body is meant to control/destroy the illusion by worshipping Almighty God. Death and birth are controlled by God based on our past and present deeds and it cannot be supposed, please.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> God has given knowledge of four Vedas to the souls which resides in human body. God has not given the knowledge to bodies. Soul realizes God and attains salvation and not bodies. Soul is unchangeable and immortal whereas bodies are changeable and are destroyed. So souls either in the body of man or woman is entitled to chant all the mantras, to listen preach and to worship God.

Guru Nanak Sahib was a great saint and has preached that all human beings are children of one formless God and all human beings must worship one formless God who never takes birth.

                <b>Ravish:</b> Why did God create the universe? He was in a state of eternal bliss before time immortal. Why did He need to create something? I have read that it's a play for Him. When the ultimate destination is merging with Him only then why create the duality in the first place? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Creation, nursing and destruction are automatically under the power of God. If God does not create then souls will remain always unconscious without bodies. Suppose at present somebody has been sleeping for the last fifty years then what is the use of a soul becoming idle. Will it be good?

                <b>Poornima:</b> Very nice and interesting to read your site. I have a question too, I went for a havan which was conducted indoors in closed room and my infant was uncomfortable because of the smoke so I sat next to the door for fresh air for the baby. But someone commented that the havan smoke is purifying, I do agree that it is purifying but not in that concentrated amount and not in confined space for babies, am I correct? Also it set off the carbon mono oxide detector which is poisonous. Is it because the samagri was not pure? Please Explain. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Thanking you. Yes please, the Havan/Yaj is stated to be performed in a open atmosphere and not in a room. Secondly the woods must be of mango, which release little bit of mono- oxide but is more beneficial to purify the atmosphere. Yagyashala must be made without doors i.e., open with all sided i.e., on pillars only.

                <b>Ravish:</b> If karmas are in our hands then how is it that a Saint can tell beforehand what we are going to do in future? Is it because He can see our Sanchit karmas and that will decide our future deeds? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Nobody can say about future please and even nobody must think about future. One should always make his future bright by doing present pious deeds/ hard working towards right path. Future is decided by present deeds only, please.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Sandhya means meditation. Sandhya means to perform havan. So havan and meditation has been doing in all trikaal i.e., past, present and future in all yugas. Or you can say it is eternal being performed in the past in every creation.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> If you've listened Bhagwat Puran kath then I will say that many stories of the kath are not tallied with Vedas please. Listening of Ved mantras is the best. Mostly the dreams are false and painful. Yet if the saints in the awakened stage preach you the Ved mantras then really you're lucky because luck is made by present pious deeds. It may be happen that you've Listened Ved mantras in dream but in awakened stage the same saint will not utter the Ved mantras.

                <b>Neeraj Chauhan:</b> The 'SHUDRA' varan persons were not allowed to listen the 'PARVACHANS' of holly spiritual books in the old ages of India rather no such order or provision is there in those holly book for such an prohibition. But they were punished by the Upper class 'BRAHMINS', if they listen to those 'SHALOKAS' or 'PARVACHANS' even by mistakes, why? No doubt the Old Spiritual Books and Vedas does not allow this prohibition or prejudice but the upper class community "Brahmins" used to prohibit those lower cast persons to listen to those "PREACHINGS OF VEDAS" and some times they behave with them with cruelty and the punishment was very inhuman to them why?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes please, holy books cannot give such order to avoid preach to any cost because preaches like Vedas or other holy books are for human beings/souls and not for any special caste. Caste system has not been made by God. So punishment etc., mentioned by you above were against the Vedas and every spiritual book but now its all okay by per govt. But yet the hundred percent implementation of govt. orders is to be made. But better if society will help. Such things are occurring only due to lack of study of Vedas, please. So at present spreading of knowledge of Vedas will sure finish the ravages of hatred. When sun rises the darkness of the night is over, similarly when knowledge of the Vedas will be spread, the illusion will automatically be over. When sun rises the illusion of the earth is removed from that portion only which comes towards sun. And rest of the portion remains dark. Similarly wherever the knowledge will be spread and gained, the ignorance/illusion from those human beings will be over. Therefore spreading of knowledge of Vedas and other holy books, is must.

                <b>Venkat Naren:</b> I have read your explanation regarding performing of havan at home. I am very much impressed. After reading this, some questions have aroused in my mind and they are as follows: 1) In the third swaha mantra OM SATYAM YASHAH SHRI MAYI SHRI SHRAYTAAM SWAHA, how should I pronounce the word SHRAYTAAM? It is SHRAY-TAAM or SHRAI-TYAAM?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Shray-taam please. 
                <br>
                <br> 2) Do I need to use fresh dry mango twigs every time I perform havan or I can continue with the left over[half burnt] twigs and add some twigs to the kund? Is there any count that a particular number of twigs should be used every time? Say 4 twigs or 6 twigs? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Every time fresh dry mango twigs are to be used, please. There is no need to count 4 or 6 twigs but we have to see that fire is burning properly with proper twigs.

                <br> 3) What all can be considered as HAVAN SAAMAAGRI that we can offer to agni kund? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b>Four matters are to be mixed to prepare havan samagri, the kinds of which are several: 
                <br> 1. Sweet matter like jaggery, honey etc. which are mixed on the same day when the havan is performed. 
                <br> 2. Nutritive matters like all pulses, etc. 
                <br> 3. Antibiotic like gyol etc. 
                <br> 4. Fragrant matters like guggal, chandan bala etc. 
                <br>
                <br> Atta, jau, kale til, rice, nagarmotha, balchhar, etc. can also be mixed. 
                <br>
                <br> 4) What should be done to the left over ash in the kund? Throw it or do we have to do anything with that? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The ash may be thrown either in flowing water or may be thrown in plantation. 
                <br>
                <br> 5) I do sandhyavandanam daily. Is it okay if I do havan after my sandhya? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The meditation can be done after havan or before havan as the time suits. 
                <br>
                <br> 6) How much time should be spent for the havan alone if I offer offerings for 21 times? 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> You can devote as much as time as suits you, please. This is worship of God and can be devoted as per your convenience.

                <b>Puneet Jain:</b> I just want to know that according to Hindu Dharma, There are 3 Lords - Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Mahesha. Actually are these Gods Exists on top of the world. If so, then their wives and all other devi-devtas must also exist. According to all more religions Jesus Christ , Allah , Shri Wahe Guru, Shri Sai Baba. Are all they exist above there? How do they live there? How do they help their followers? I am not able to express my question but I feel that you will understand my question and satisfy my curiosity. Thanking You very much...

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There is only one God who is formless, creates, nurses and destroy the universe. He is almighty and supreme, beyond description, beyond imagination and beyond calculation. He is omnipresent and omniscient. Divine qualities of Almighty God are described in eternal knowledge of Vedas. Vedas emanates direct from God. So all Hindus and others too believe in Vedas. Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh are the name of one said God. God has no wives please because he is almighty and needs no any assistance etc. No one is above God please. All religions tell to worship God.

                <b>Anil Kumar Rana:</b> It is said by saints, what does man do or think, it comes back to him by more force. If some-aggressive person make suffering to innocent and innocent person curse that cruel person, then is the curse given by the person will affect back to the person who gave curse or it may be treated as punishment given to the rouge person. Because if the strong cruel person make suffering to innocent week, then week has no other way but will curse mentally. Should person curse or not? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The persons are free to do pious deeds or sins. But result is awarded by God. So, one has always to face the result of his good or bad deeds. God is everywhere and sees all over deeds. Curse from innocent/weak person is natural. But such person must pray to God. However, God listens pray in holy yagya. Otherwise the rules of the God in the Vedas are very clear that he always give punishment to defaulters.

                <b>N. S. Venkateshwaran:</b> I heard a close friend saying that the Gayatri Mantra was cursed by the ancient rishis after seeing that it is very powerful and gives instant results. Hence, no benefit will be derived by chanting this mantra unless we first say the mantras to release the Gayatri Mantra from its curse. Only thereafter, the Gayatri Mantra is to be chanted. Thus, all the cassettes etc of this maha mantra available in market are of no use to anyone listening to them and chanting along with. Is this right?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No please this is not right. Every Ved mantra has its divine meaning in the shape of prayer, praise and worship of God and thousands of other subjects based on gyan kand (knowledge/science etc.,), karam kand (shape of deeds) and Upasana kand (worship). Gayatri mantra has three subjects at a time-pray, praise and worship. So it has its own divine quality. Gayatri mantra is in three Vedas, i.e., Saamveda, Rigveda and Yajurveda. Ved mantras emanates direct from God with His blessings. So who can curse the mantras i.e., nobody can curse. Instead Gayatri mantras or other mantras are recited and studied to kill the bad karmas and to have a long happy life. Is there any above God to curse the mantra? So please recite, repeat the Gayatri mantra and do havan also from Gayatri mantras. I have written a book on Yaj explaining Ved mantras in Hindi. The book can be sent to you if you so desire please.

It means Karan had tried earlier. Original shlok of Mahabhart are only 10,000 whereas at present Mahabhart book contains about 1 lakh 20,000 shlok.

                <b>N. S. Venkateshwaran:</b> You preach vegetarian diet and strictly following the ancient Vedic way of life.

Is this right? If wrong, why such wrong facts are being taught in schools? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No please, only to blame the Vedic pious deeds and to attract the people towards self made sects the above propaganda spread. For-example, there is a Yaj named "ASHWAMADH" people insulted the Vedas saying Ashwa means horse and in Yajna horses are sacrificed and there meat is distributed. Whereas the meaning of ashwa here is nation. (Shatpath Brahmin Granth 13/1/6 refers). There is a Narmedh Yaj whcioh is performed when someone is dead and his dead body is placed on pyre. But those who are against the Vedas spread that Nar means man and the man are sacrificed, which is wrong and against the Vedas. There is a word in Vedas, ADHWAR which means there is no place for violence in Yaj. The false preaching must be stopped immediately for which social workers should discharge their duties. Otherwise the eternal culture of pious Vedas is being destroyed intentionally by the arrogant who are against the Vedas.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Drashta is soul and drishya is whatever we see in the world like sun, moon, trees, mountains, animals including our bodies, etc. The soul sees through eyes and mind. Eyes and mind is also drishya. So soul is alive matter and mind etc., are non-alive matters. Non-alive matters are destroyed being made from prakriti, but alive are immortal. Alive are not made from any matters. (i.e., alive matters have no reason behind for its existence).

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> God has not made any religion. The knowledge of Vedas emanates direct from God at the time of unisexual creation in the heart of four Rishis, wherein every subject including creation is mentioned. So the knowledge of Vedas is applicable for whole human beings. The first human beings (unsexual creation from prakriti) were created somewhere in a place of Himalaya. However, According to Manusmriti shlok 1/136,141, the present creation was created about one arab, 96 crore, 8 lakh 53 thousand years back. The matter regarding creation is also very well mentioned in Rigveda mandal 10 sukta 129 onwards. As regards first man and woman, the human bodies in the shape of man and woman were made several. Thereafter at a time the souls with breathing system entered and when the bodies yet not moved, even creation like the bodies of animals, birds and others trees, moon etc., did not work, the Almighty God entered the universe being omnipresent and everything started working as usual. As regards idol worship Vedas preach to worship one formless, omnipresent, omniscient and Almighty God, who creates, nurses and destroys the universe. Vedas do not tell for idol worship or avtar. Yes please, Vedas strictly warn not to take non-vegetarian food. In Vedas there is only one God which is known only after listening the Vedas. No question of 365 crore Gods. The creator of the universe is one and HE is the Supreme. HE never takes avtar because HE needs not. Being formless He controls, creates, nurses and destroys the universe without any assistance. So no necessity of avtarwad, please.

                <b>Aamir:</b> I have heard that every sinner has a future and every saint a past. I have sinned a lot. Though I have tried sincere repentance, my bad karmas from this life (and perhaps earlier ones too) don't seem to leave me. I have tried meditating, chanting mantras, pilgrimages, but literally, they seem to help only transiently. Are some sins so great that even the mighty Hanuman can't redeem the person? I have been chanting Hanuman Chaleesa many scores of times a day. I have also done 100 recitations in a single day many times. Death is the ultimate destiny of all. Sometimes I feel if I were dead it would solve all problems. I have been an optimist all along but of late my confidence in my own faith has been waning. Should I pray for death? What is a good mahurat fo die in 2006?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Everybody has the past either saints or sinners. The present life of human being is too based on past. Our present deeds will make our future either good or bad, according to our present deeds. By doing the present pious deeds based on spiritualism the past sins are destroyed and the present as well as future life is made pleasant. So there must be no worry about the past or future, but present pious deeds. Saints kill the past by present pious deeds which everybody must do even in the family life. Only repentance will not serve the purpose. One will have to do worship alongwith hard pious deeds and must discharge moral duties faithfully. In this way the spiritual advices are necessary. One has to worship a formless God who creates, nurses and destroys the universe. Hanuman was a yogi, he also worshipped formless God. So the worship of formless God is required. In my opinion whatever worship told above by you is against the Vedas, please. Normal death is always welcome by all, being awarded by God Himself. But even thinking of suicide is great sin. God has blessed the human body to worship God and maintain long happy life. Difficulties come due to previous lives' deeds which have to be faced bravely. Regarding death Mirza Galib has statded his views, "MUJHE KAY BURA THA MARNA, GAR EK BAAR HOTA," SO PLEASE BE BRAVE. And continue to be a faithful optimist. I pray God to give you long happy life and braveness. YOGA PHILOSOPHY IS NOT A SECT PLEASE AND THUS APPLICABLE TO ALL HUMAN BEINGS OF ANY SECT. SO try to learn yoga asan and meditation. Do only pious deeds. And attend good society only. Never sit idle and try to discharge your moral duties faithfully. Hard working towards right path must continue. Then everything will be okay.

Please tell me how to stop the effects of aging (growing old) and how to attain youthfullness for ever in the growing age. Please tell me how do I retain physical and mental strength and energy of the young age in the time of older days? How to stop white hairs? How to stay young forever?

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> One should awake early in the morning about 4 O' clock and it is rightly said, "early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy And wise. After going bathroom then one must sit for some time to jaap the holy name of God. Asan, pranayaam and meditation must be learnt and practice daily. Daily morning walk and exercise is essential. Must take plenty of water daily i.e., at least 20 glass of water daily. The said daily routine will sure give you a big benefit in the life. Must also perform daily agnihotr, please. This will give physical as well as mental power. However, it must be remembered that without adopting Brahamcharya no benefit can be obtained, so please avoid bad society and control your five senses, five perceptions and mind.

If God decides the time of the birth of a soul then I guess this family planning in this world has no importance and it is useless.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The human body is blessed by God for facing the results of previous good or bad deeds in the shape of happiness and sorrows, etc. In addition the human beings are also free to do pious deeds in the present life according to Vedas/spiritualism to kill past lives' bad deeds/sins. Then the sorrows end. There is a phrase, MAN PROPOSES GOD DISPOSES. So human being is free to do bad or good deeds, but the result of deeds is awarded by God. I mean to say that luck is in our hands. So when a person desires to hold complete brahmcharya by adopting true spiritualism then if in his luck there were, for example, six issues then he can minimize, and like Bhisham Pitamaha, he can adopt complete brahmachayra for whole of his life. So is the case of women. Gargi was a learned of Vedas and did not marry for whole of her life. She was Acharya of King Janak. In both cases the said dignitaries themselves decided not to marry. Otherwise they could have got issues. So the birth is in hands of God when man has not followed the path of Vedas/spiritualism and on the other hand he may get issues as many as he requires by adopting Brahmcharya in the married life. So, present system of family planning is not needed in case of those who follow brahmcharya and path of Vedas/spiritualism.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Efforts is the best. In Vedas effort is named Purusharth i.e., hard working towards right path. So luck is in our hands.

                <br> Rishi Valmiki ji was a holy dignitary. He didn't desire to write Valmiki Ramayana as such dignitaries have all command on their senses, perceptions and mind. He heard the story of Shri Ram from Rishi Narad. Once Rishi Valmiki ji was going to take bath in the river nearest to his ashram with his disciple Rishi Bhardwaj. He saw a hunter who killed male kraunch bird, so female started crying with sorrow, due to the death of his male kraunch. Suddenly some words were uttered by Rishi Valmiki ji to the hunter as a punishment in the shape of curse. The pious Rishi felt that the words used in the shape of a poetry. He was pleased because the first poetry of the world was uttered by him. Then there came Brahma, a Rishi not God. He requested Valmiki ji to write the life- sketch (biography) of Shri Ram. Then Rishi Valmiki ji wrote Valmiki Ramayana on the request of Rishi Brahma. So, no question of fame. Fame comes automatically in respect of Rishis-Munis due to their hard tapsya, worship and qualities. If karmas are sinful, then sorrows, problems are to be faced and if karmas are pious then there will be happy life. Present life has to face past lives' karmas.

Even very few know the meaning of Ashwamedh Yagya. Shatpath Brahmin Granth says, "rashtrm vaa ashwamedhah", i.e., to protect the nation. The king used to attract and nurse the public providing them justice and this pious action of the king's is Ashwamadh. The ancient kings even used to perform holy Yagya to pray God to give them power to give justice to the nation. Secondly when the word Yagya (Yajyen) is used definitely it pertains to the eternal knowledge of Vedas emanates direct from God. Human beings must study Vedas to know the fact of Yagya and other matters. The gentlemen who listen Vedas definitely performs daily havan/Yajyen whereas Rigveda mantra 10/71/4 states "UTA TWAH VACHAM PASHYAN NA PASHYATI", i.e., he who does not know the Sanskrit script he when see the Vedas then overlooks. So the people who do not know about the Vedas are innocent and do not like to listen even. However this is sin, because in Vedas everywhere God says that human life is meant to listen Vedas being the best worship of the God and to be learned of all matters of the universe. Then nobody will say that something is like thousand Ashwamedh Yagya, i.e., the pious result is only obtained after performing Yagya and Shastra says, "YAJOVAI SHESHTHAMAM KARMH", therefore when Yagya is the best pious deed then what will be equivalent to Yagya. The dreams are not true please. Deeds must be in action always.

Accordingly your children must listen preaches of Vedas/shastras/holy books from the said learned person as said in Yajurveda mantra 40/14. We must do hard work to get progress simultaneously in both sides, i.e., spiritualism as well as in worldly pious deeds--- education etc. Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, Mata Sita etc., became Supreme dignitary in the public due to listening of preach of Vedas from Rishis and too by adopting the same preach.

What is the purpose of life? What we want to achieve in this life? Please reply. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes please, the luck is always in our hand and is made by hard working, pious deeds, following true eternal spiritual path of Vedas/ashtang yoga, (to control five perceptions, five senses and mind), discharging of all moral duties with concentration, devotion, and dedication. One has to face the result of his karmas of previous and present life. But Yog shastra sutra 2/16 states, "HEYEM DUKHAM ANAGATAM", i.e., the sorrows yet to face in future are to be finished. There are three types of deeds (karmas) sanchit, prarabhadh and kriyamann. Suppose one soul has to take birth (body). It means he has to face total number of deeds of his all previous lives and these deeds are called sanchit karmas. But sanchit deeds are huge/unlimited and can not be faced in one life. So the karmas which can be faced in one life are called prarabhadh (luck-destiny). So God has not made our luck at His own, but Almighty God has taken the deeds which we have already done. Yajurveda mantra 7/48 clarifies that human being is free to do any deed good or bad but God only awards the result. Now the balance deeds from sanchit deeds will be counted in the next life. Now the deeds which we do in our present life day today are called kriyamann. So if we do pious deeds according to Vedas, shastras and holy books and based on pious preaches of Rishi, Muni/learned saints then our all sanchit deeds are burnt and we can get salvation. So human beings are free in the matter of doing deeds good or bad. But result will be awarded by God. So we must worship and do pious deeds under guidance of a learned Guru. So one should go always ahead for hard working, pious deeds, worship to make future bright himself. One should always work hard towards a right path. Worship does not mean that we are free to discharge our family duties, education, etc., but rather it is a sin. So we have to get progress in both way at a time i.e., spiritualism and worldly progress i.e., science, education , duties towards family etc. 
                <br>
                <br> So God creates the universe according to His eternal laws framed in Vedas which are always unchangeable and unchallengeable. So we have to follow the law of God always to get long happy life.
                <br>
                <br> The purpose of life is to realize the God. But the path to realize the God is preached by God in four Vedas, wherein one has to do pious deeds and has to get progress in pious worldly affairs as well as in spiritualism together, while discharging all moral duties preached in Vedas and other true holy Granths. For this very purpose one has to study Vedas regularly and obey the preach mentioned therein. The Vedas are to be listened first from a learned Acharya.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Hanuman ji was minister of Sugreev. While Shri Ram and Lakshman were searching Sita mata in jungle they met with a great dignity i.e., Shri Hanuman ji. So Hanumaan ji became a faithful dignity of Shri Ram and served a lot to Shri Ram. Naturally Shri Ram was greater than Hanuman ji. Valmiki Ramayana says Shri Ram attained the knowledge of Vedas and yoga philosophy from Vashisth Muni ji. Shri Ram followed path of Vedas. As mentioned in Vedas Shri Ram used to listen Vedas and do havan/Yajyen daily. He used to serve the Rishis Munis. And used to meditate for Almighty God. Naturally at that time Rishis Munis were respectable to Shri ram and Almighty God is always supreme to all. So please worship Almighty, formless, omnipresent. Omniscient God, who creates, nurses and destroy the universe.

Both must save energy. Then one can get good baby. Our traditional examples are so many of the ancient times. For example king dashrath, who used to perform Havan/yagya daily with Ved mantras performed a yagya with the blessings of Rishi Shringi to get learned children. It took a long time. King prateep did tapsya with his wife, according to Vedas to get learned child. And he got a son Shantnu.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Thanking you, please. For this concentration must be improved. Physical and mental strength is required to maintain the said qualities. Knowledge of brahmcharya to be followed, either in unmarried or in married life, is needed. So in human life one should study Vedas, must do jaap of holy name of God and must do yagya (yajyen) daily while discharging moral duties daily in family life too. For the same, good preach from Vedas by a spiritual dignitary (learned of Vedas/yoga philosophy) is also required. Normally effects of various form is vritti. And chitta is the combination of intellect, egoism, and mana, i.e., faculty which receives knowledge from five senses and passes the same to intellect. One has to stop or minimize the chitta vrittis, for which practice of yam, niyam, asan and pranayaam is essential. In short one should awake early in the morning, must go for a morning walk and exercises. Must take plenty of water daily, must listen preach of Vedas, must do daily jaap of holy name of God, must do daily havan and practice of yoga philosophy quoted above.

If a man resides in a room, then it does not happen that man take form of room. Room will always be separate from man. The principles of Vedas are always unchangeable and therefore can not be changed as per one desire. So fulfill of desire of a man by God in such cases, is quite impossible being against the Vedas.

Even smaller than atom (minutest), Yajurveda mantra 40/8 states "SA PARYAGAAT" i.e., God is everywhere, "SHUKRAM" unlimited powers--- Almighty, "AKAYAM" i.e., bodyless . There are three types of bodies of shape, minutest and which has reason behind. And Yajurveda mantra 2/26 also states," SWAYAMBHUHU ASI", that God is eternal. Nobody has made God. God has no mother and father etc. Actually God nurses the universe, so He is our father. So according to Vedas and experiences of all Rishis Munis, God is formless and is not sakaar, i.e., is shapeless.

So nowadays most of the people being indulged in illusion (materialistic articles) are not able to pay their attention to get knowledge to realize God. People thus have started to think that whatever is being seen in the shape of gold and assets, family, pomp and show, ostentation, and sensuality, anger, pride, greed, etc., are source of getting peace which all is false. That is why most of the people of the world, due to lack of knowledge of eternal spiritualism have been experiencing sorrows, tensions, problems, diseases, restlessness, family problem, corruption, early deaths, floods, storms, earthquake, baseless war, insult of women, etc., etc., all over the world.

And most of the people are ignorant about the eternal knowledge of four Vedas wherein there is only one formless Almighty God who protects, nurses, and gives peace and merriment is only to be worshipped. God is creator of the universe so we have to worship Creator and not His creation or creation by human beings.

God is not seen with eyes, has no mouth to talk. He is formless. We the souls need assistance of eye, ear, nose, tongue, skin to see, hear, etc., whereas God being Almighty needs no assistance of anybody.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> We all live in this world where actually importance of money, pomp and show and sons etc., are only considered and that is why the humanity is being crushed. The people who are having lot of money, sons, buildings, status, etc., etc., have no real happiness. And this is only due to lack of eternal knowledge of Vedas. In Vedas importance is considered for truth only. Now a days so called gurus also based on bookish knowledge only teaches truth that soul is immortal, etc., etc., but most of them need unlimited money, sons, building, cars, aeroplanes' journey and all valuable assets also. So it is a surprising that duly indulged with illusion most of the present saints talk to keep the people away from illusion. So our eyes must be on truth and truth is soul and God and not body. In Vedas there is no difference between boy and girl, because body is boy and girl, and not soul. Soul resides in body, therefore even animals, birds etc., are pitiable by human beings, because their bodies have the same soul. King Janak has two daughters only, Mata Sita and Urmila, he had no son, the king Janak with his own qualities and the good qualities which he gave to his daughters is being remembered up till now. On the other hand Bhisham Pitamaha, Bal Brahamcharini Gargi, who was king Janak's guru, Yagvalkya Muni having two wives had no issue but due to their tapsya and good qualities, the said dignitaries are being remembered. Five Pandavs i.e., Yudhishtir, Bhim, Arjuna, Nakul and Sahdev had five sons and their sons were died in young age but Pandavs are still remembered due to their own good qualities about knowing truth from Vedas.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Thanking you please. Now a days there are so many types of worships. So many Yogis are preaching Yoga philosophy. While I was writing detailed comments on Patanjal Yog darshan, I read comments of Vyas Muni on Yog shastra sutra 1/28, the adorable Muni states--- one must concentrate in Yoga philosophy by studying Vedas. So worship, Yoga philosophy are afterwards, first Vedas are to be listened/perused thoroughly. Due to lack of knowledge of Vedas, mostly piece meal Yoga philosophy is being taught, which is harmful. I mean to say, the base of worship and Yoga philosophy to be learnt is Ved. For example Yajurveda mantra 7/4 states, "UPYAAM GRIHATAH MAGHWAN", i.e., O! aspirant you have to practice 'Upyaam' i.e., yam, niyam ,asan, pranayaam, PRATYAHAR, DHARNA, DHYAN, SAMADHI. WHY to practice? The mantra answers, "SOMAM PAHI" i.e., to protect 'som'. Here 'som', means the divine experience of merriment occurs while realizing God in Asamprgyat Samadhi. So according to all four Vedas and Yog shastra even, yoga philosophy is preached in Vedas and is meant to realize God and not only maintain health. Secondly the base of yoga philosophy preached in first fold path of Ashtang yoga is Brahamcharya, which is not being preached. 
                <br>
                <br> Mostly first two fold paths,i.e., yam and niyam, are being ignored which is even sin. This truth I wanted to tell you please. For example, Atharvaveda mantra 2/4/2, states that when anyone follow the path of Vedas and strictly adopt Brahamcharya and thus he/she do not waste semen/then he becomes able to overcome all kinds of diseases including depression. I am writing a book on Brahamcharya and will be completed within month. First of all I will advice you to be strict in brahamcharya. Then you must learn and do some yoga asan and pranayaam. Only take vegetarian food. Plenty of water must be taken daily, i.e., at least 15-20 glass of water a day. One should awake early in the morning for a walk and light exercises. And thereafter must perform agnihotr from Ved mantras. This all will be beneficial to control depression.

Where can we read about the history of these great personalities (like Ramayana for history of Rama)?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> In Vedas brahma is called a learned of four Vedas. However, Brahma is also a name of God being the greatest in the universe. The meaning of word Vishnu is omnipresent and omnipresent is only God, so the Vishnu is also a name of God. Shiv means who lookafter the welfare of universe, so He is only God. So Shiva is also a name of God. However, brahma, Vishnu and Shiv could be also name of learned Yogis, Rishis or Munis. But God is one and has unlimited power and names. So one should first study the Vedas which are divine light for human beings to solve any problem. Thereafter Valmiki Ramayana and Mahabhart are beneficial.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Neither jeev nor consciousness goes to truth. Here truth means God. According to Yog shastra sutra 1/2 aspirant controls his chitta vritti by studies of Vedas, yaj and hard practice of Ashtang yoga, with the result soul realizes God, Who is already within soul and was hidden due to illusion. God is everywhere. In Japuji Sahib, Guru Nanak Dev ji has told the truth. Actually Shri Guru Granth Sahib Banni mostly tallied with four Vedas. Guru Naank Dev Sahib says ---
                <br> ONKAAR VED NIRMAAYE (Guru Granth Sahib Mahla 1 ONKAAR SHABD) i.e., the Vedas emanates from God. 
                <br>
                <br> HARI AAGYA HOY VED PAAP PUNYA VICHARYA (Mahla 5 Shabd 1) i.e., Vedas are under order of God to facilitate the human beings to distinguish between sins and pious deeds. 
                <br>
                <br> DIVA TALE ANDHERA JAAE VED PAATH MATI PAAPA LAAE. i.e., darkness is over by a burning lamp, so the studies of Vedas destroy all sins. 
                <br>
                <br> VED KATEV KAHHU MAT JHOOTHE JHOOTHA JO NA VICHARE. i.e., Vedas are not lie, instead he is liar who do not try to understand the Vedas. 
                <br>
                <br> In Japuji Sahib ----
                <br> EK ONKAAR SATINAAMU KARTA PURKHU NIRBHAU NIRVAIRU AKAALMURTI AJUNI S BHANG GUR PRASADI - is according to Vedas. In the beginning of the earth Almighty God originates the knowledge of four Vedas in the heart of four Rishis and traditionally the same is being spread to the aspirants. God has unlimited qualities whereas soul has limited. So the complete Guru of the universe was/is/will be Almighty God as told by Rishi Patanjali in his yog shastra sutra 1/26, i.e., SHE ESH PURVESHAAM API GURU KALENAN AVECHHEDAAT, i.e., God is immortal, so He is first Guru of the four Rishis of beginning of the earth of first unsexual creation because in the previous world at the time of final destruction all Rishis Munis are dead. Therefore in new creation there remains no Rishi Muni to give knowledge. So under the administration/power of Almighty God, the knowledge of four Vedas automatically emanates from God and is originated in the heart of four Rishis, which is spread thereafter by Rishis. On thing more only God is complete Guru being Almighty. Equivalent to God neither borne nor will get birth. So Vedas are complete being knowledge direct from God.

Even in four Vedas there is no mention of such huge asans and pranayaam. The proof are Vedas and six shastras. Vyas Muni in his comments on Patanjali Yog Darshan sutra 2/46 (Sadhanpad) has advised padamasan, virasan, bhadrasan, swastik, dandasan, saupashreya, paryank, kraunchnishdan, hastinishdan, ustrnishdan, samsansthan, sthir, such asan and yatha sukh asan. Secondly Vyas Muni in sutra 2/49,50,&amp;51 states that when perfect attainment on asan (asan siddhi) is achieved then pranayaam is done, i.e., now the breathing system is easily stopped . There are three types of pranayaam 
                <br> 1.Bahya, 2.Abhyanter, 3. Stambhvritti and when out and inner subjects are left then it is called fourth pranayaam. Rishi Patanjali as well as Muni Vyas 2/52 clarify that the pranayaam is only done to burn the illusion. And asans are done to begin the pranayaam. Patanjali Rishi and Vyas Muni say that when an aspirant needs no efforts to do asans and have attained the stage to concentrate mind/ chitta in Almighty God and asan are done easily automatically then it means the aspirant has got perfection in asan (asan siddhi). Now both the rishi concluded that asan and pranayaam are meant only to realize God and not to get good health or to finish the diseases etc. So mostly the present saints are earning the money and I think they have diverted the attention of people towards false health and have uprooted the real eternal knowledge of ashtang yoga philosophy, the aim of which was only to realize God. So it is very dangerous stage of the world. Yajurveda mantra 7/4 (and all Vedas) says "UPYAAMGRIHITAH ASI, URUSHAYA MAGHWAN SOMAM PAHI ANTAH YACHH" i.e., O! aspirant you have to do ashtang yoga practice, do pranayaam, and attain assets of yoga philosophy/salvation. So in Vedas and shastras there is no mention to do asan or pranayaam to attain good health. Good health will be automatically when you will do hard practice of ashtang yoga i.e., Yam, niyam, asan, pranayaam, pratyahar, dharna, dhyan and samadhi. Atharvaveda says that if anyone will steal little bit portion of yoga/Vedas knowledge then I will crush him by feet and will thus give them death punishment. I.e., for example a rat cuts a little bit portion of shirt and takes away the same then it is clear that rat has taken little bit portion not shirt in full. So is the case of ashtang yoga and Vedas knowledge. The most of present false yoga teachers who are against the Vedas have started teaching a little bit ashtang yoga portion (mainly asan, pranayaam, and meditation and even against Vedas and yoga shastra) to give them temptation of health etc. , whereas our Indian wrestlers have/had good health by doing Indian exercises, so we must not kill our eternal culture.

                <b>Raj Bhalla:</b> I would greatly appreciate if you could please translate Matra 1, HYMN 115 of Rigveda, that goes like this, Om Chitram Devanamudgadnikam Chakshu Mitrsaye--.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> OM CHITRAM DEVANAMUDGADNIKAM CHAKSHURMITRSAYA VARUNASYAAGNEHE.
                <br> AAPRAA DYAWAPRITHIVI ANTRIKSHAM SUYRA AATMA JAGATASTATHUSHASHCHA.
                <br>
                <br> (Devta) subject of this mantra is Surya (God). So in this Rig-Veda mantra 1/115/1, the qualities of God have been described. Whatsoever exists in the world, except God, has limited qualities and where the unlimited qualities are concerned, He is only Almighty God. So only God has unlimited qualities and powers. The meaning is as under--- (Anikam) He who (God) can't be seen by eyes and is (Devanaam) to learned and (Mitrasya) to sun like a friend and (Varunsaya) to water and moon etc., (Agnehe) to electricity and fire etc., of all matters (Chakshuhu) is creator and enables us to see the same (chitram) wonderfully (Udgaat i.e., by utkarshtaha i.e., superiority/climax) is realized by superiority (i.e., when an aspirant realizes God after doing hard study of Vedas and practice of ashtang yoga and thus attaining Asampragyat Samadhi/ dharmmegh Samadhi as per yog shastra sutra 4/30,31,32).
                <br>
                <br> (Suryah) i.e., sun, i.e., God who gives Vedas knowledge like sun, He is (Jagatah i.e., jangam) of movable world, (cha) and (Tasthushah i.e., charachar jagat) i.e., movable and immovable world (atma) i.e., antaryaami i.e., omnipresent and omniscient.
                <br>
                <br> He who is (Aapraha) is filing in all respects (Antriksham) i.e., space (Dyawaprithivi) i.e., heavenly bodies and earth, i.e., God being omnipresent is present in space, heavenly bodies and earth too. 
                <br>
                <br> The idea is that the Almighty God is donor of knowledge of Vedas as sun who showers its rays of light to the universe. He is omnipresent and omniscient within movable and immovable world, which is complete in all respect i.e., matters, science, etc. So we have to worship the God having all the above qualities mentioned in the above Ved mantra. However, only few qualities of God are mentioned here, in fact God has unlimited qualities. The conclusion of mantra is - God can't be seen by eyes being formless, He is beyond description, Almighty, omniscient and omnipresent. The God is one who creates, nurses and destroys the universe and neither equivalent nor greater God is there, the God only awards the result of karmas to the human beings in the shape of pious deeds and sins resulting happiness and sorrows.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yajurveda mantra 40/5 says, " TADANTRSYA = TAT + SARVAYSA + ANTAH " I.E., Almighty God resides in the soul. Soul resides in body so God resides within body, where soul resides. Yajurveda mantra 31/19 says "PRAJAPATIHI GARBHE ANTAH CHARTI" , i.e, God resides in the soul but "DHEERAH PARIPASHYANTI" – the yogi, who studied Vedas and did hard practice of Ashtang Yoga, only realizes him. 
                <br>
                <br> Gurbani says, "MANN MANDARTAN BHESH KALENDAR, GHAT HI TEERTH NAHANVAN" i.e, our mann is a temple of God. Bhagwat Geeta shlok 18/61,"ISHWARAH SARVBHOOTANAAM HRIDESHE TISHATI," i.e., God resides in the heart of human body. According to Yajurveda mantra 40/8, though God is everywhere being Omnipresent but is realized always by above quoted complete yogi within him (heart). That is why one has to control his all chitta vrittis (various effects of outgoing and incoming thoughts as stated in Yog shatra sutra 1/2. So now it is up to an aspirant whether he considers temple made by God in his heart and follow path of Vedas or he makes own temple anywhere else outside the heart.

                <b>Archana:</b> You said that there in no jadoo tona but then what about tantra pooja and its effect. It’s true and people get affected with that. If some positive power is there than negative power is also there. and negative power effect faster than the positive one. Hence how can we get over with that.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes negative and positive powers may be there. But in the spiritualism we have to overcome the negatives to reach or realize positive (truth). The light of sun is there, so who is empowered in the world to produce darkness, even a handful of darkness before the rising sun. I.e., negative power is destroyed by positive one. Actually in case of truth (positive), there is only one way of knowledge of four Vedas like a sun. But time being the knowledge of Vedas is being oversighted as told by Tulsidassji.

Sukshma Sharir is of one of five vital airs (five prann), five senses, five suksham bhoot and mann and buddhi. Karan Sharir = within which the sound sleep is observed (Shushupti Awastha) fourth is Turiya Sharir within which a yogi realizes merriment attaining salvation.

Is there the prescription or the mention about it in Vedas, Smrtis or Tantras, or verbal popular custom? All that exists is interacting: from earth-element up to Brahman.

Because God Himself has preached in Vedas to take advice and medicine and medical authorities. In second step one should do asan and pranayaam under instruction of a yogi, who knows Vedas and ashtang yoga philosophy. So kindly seek a perfect Yogi locally to learn pranayaam in person.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Fear is due to illusion. When an aspirant follow a true path of Vedas, yaj, ashtang yoga practice then automatically fear is over one day. Fear is never useful. One should live happily without any fear and everybody even, wish for the same. Fear is due to sin also, so one should always avoid bad and unpious deeds. One should never do the deed for which he feels fear and shame. For this very purpose we must always listen/study Vedas, perform holy yagya and practice of ashtang yoga.

                <br> What is the meaning of guru and kul?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Guru gives education and good advices. But when word Gurukul is concerned then gurukul means institution where acharya, learned of Vedas and yoga philosophy, used to preach the knowledge of Sanskrit and Vedas to the students. So guru means acharya and KUL means tribe. This tribe is of an acharya and not of parents. Actually there are two types of birth. First birth is from mother and father, which is not considered good until the boy or daughter goes to acharya to take diksha of Vedci education yaj etc. When one goes to an acharya and gets diksha then it means he has taken second birth and therefore is called "Dwij" ('Dwi' means second and 'ja' means birth. After becoming Dwij, his first birth is also considered good. In second birth acharya becomes spiritual father. Saamveda mantra 744 states , "I pray the immortal God who was worshipped before by my father (acharya)." Rigveda 1/149/5 throw the light that first janam is given by mother and father and second by an acharya. So Gurukul is the institution where all dwij take Vedic education from an acharya. For example Yogeshwar Krishna and Sudama both studied Vedas in gurukul of Sandeepan Rishi.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> In Vedas there is no caste system by birth. It is according to qualities. So intercaste marriages are always according to Vedas and can be performed. However, qualities of boys and girls are checked before marriage. So, suitable match is allowed to marry.

As regards proof Vedas and shastras ask Ved mantra as a proof to determine truth in token. Vedas do not speak about God to be in a form.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> First of all the God is a Supreme judge who awards the result of karmas. Suppose judge is not there then sins can be faced by a gentleman or pious deeds can give benefit to a sinner. Secondly worship kills the all karmas and nothing then is to face and the aspirant attains salvation. Yaj, agnihotra, yogabhyas surely kills the past live's sins, but the sins being done in the present life will have to be faced. No sin is excused being the law of God in the Vedas. But actually when an aspirant starts performing holy yaggya, name jaap, yoga practice/worship in a real eternal direction by an acharya, then the sins are burnt and aspirant gradually also becomes unable to do sins. Actually you're discussing the matter about sins etc., but practically you're not indulged in performing agnihotra, listening of Vedas, name jaap and ashtang yoga practice, so your doubt is natural that agnihotr etc., is done to escape from sins. But this is not the reality. Actually only agnihotr and daan etc., mentioned above by you are not enough. The pious deeds and all karmas are mentioned in Vedas and Vedas emanates from God. God being a supreme judge has taught us in the Vedas as to how to face any problem justicably. So in your personal matter also a learned of Vedas has to listen both sides to give justice. Offer from your parents must always be appreciated. But demands from parents must be avoided. Your views are appreciated to do hard work, if possible please send your bio data in detail for consideration.

                <b>Gulshan Aggarwal:</b> I have some doubt regarding the spirtual phenomenon that game of life is like a drama where God is the Director, Writer, Producer, Editor, Censor, Judge and all in all of this drama. He decides the time of entry and exit. Creatures play role on the stage of life as per the directions given by the God. Those who please God by their good acting their roles get elevations and better roles to play.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No please, God is not director etc. If he is director then there is no sin because then we will have to do all the bad deeds aslo under his guidance, which is quite impossible. Vide yajurveda mantra 40/8, God is almighty, purest, away from any sin etc., omnipresent, omniscient, gives the knowledge of four Vedas. As per yajurveda mantra 7/48, we all are free to do good or bad deeds but result is awarded by God according to deeds. He has given the knowledge of Vedas wherein there are preaches not to do sin. If anybody does sin he has to face the consequences. 
                <br>
                <br> God decides rebirth according to our good or bad deeds. If we follow His teachings of Vedas then He gives merriment and aspirant attains salvation finishing the cycle of death and birth. So God never gives any directions to anybody. Not good acting but pious deeds according to Vedas please. Acting is always harmful being artificial. God resides within all. And He every time looks every action and no one can cheat him.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Gulshan Aggarwal:</b> My doubt is that there are negative roles also to be played in the drama of life and when the God is all in all why negative roles are said to be bad even if the the person concerned plays that role to the best of his abilities. If we play negative roles to properly in the name of the God, are they worthy of getting his grace and the player of the role will get better roles to play in his future lives. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> To the best of abilities, depends if abilities have base of preaches of four Vedas, then no problem arises. Negative means against the Vedas which is strictly prohibited, please. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Yogesh:</b> I would like to ask you something regarding Bhagavat Gita. In Bhagavat Gita Sri.Krishna tells to Arjuna to fight but again he says that one should follow non-violence(16 chap). I could'nt understand the purpose of his saying so.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There are four types of varnn (class) --- brahmin, kshatriye, vaishye and shudra. Vedas is a knowledge direct from God wherein the duties have accordingly been entrusted. But remember that there is no caste system in the Vedas, of now a days. Bhagwat Geeta is a Vedic preach. So duty of kshatriye is to fight, to save the nation in a war, but remaining classes always need help from khastriye or warrior-a king. Brahmin has to shower mercy. So Geeta's preach is for all classes accordingly. If a warrior will do mercy in a war then he will become sinner. And when he kills the enemies it means he is doing pious deeds. So non-violence is for brahmin, who knows Vedas and does yagya and hard pratice of yoga. So the all type of knowledge is to be attained by all and is therefore also was given by Shri Krishna but Arjuna being warrior was not entitled to non-violence during war or to maintain justice. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Sonali:</b> According to Ved, we have only one God for every people or every religion then why in our Hindu religion we do worship of so many Gods?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> If there is no sun rise, naturally there will remain always darkness. So is the case of above worship. i.e., due to non-study of Vedas from learned, spiritual master of Vedas, people have become innocent and do not know the true preaches of true Almighty God, who is one, was one and will remain always one. Neither anybody took birth nor will take birth, equivalent to the said God. He is almighty, omnipresent, omniscient, formless, creates, nurses and destroy the universe. So there is a great need of study of Vedas to overcome the present illusion. Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, Mata Sita, ancient rishi-munis were all followers of God given knowledge of Vedas only. We have also to follow the same. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Sonali:</b> In other religion there is boundation to do worship of so many Gods, according to them this is wrong, so they like to do worship of only one Almighty (Ved mention it) but in Hinduism this is not wrong. Why?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Sun, moon etc., are created by God. But in films, so many times the artificial sun, moon trees, fruits, etc., are created which are seemed to be original, but truly those are not original, and can never even. After Mahabhart war the preaches of Vedas were started to be finished. With the result people made their own paths to worship against the Vedas. Tulsi ramayna in this connection also says--- 
                <br> Marg soi jaa kahun joi bhava. Pandit soi jo gaal bajawa. 
                <br> Mithyaarambh dhambh rat joi. Taa kahun sant kahii sab koi. 
                <br>
                <br> Meaning: In kaliyug mostly the people adopt the path of worship which suits them according to own choice. He is termed to be a learned who boats. He who is proud, accept falsehood indulges in deceit, he is termed as famous saint. 
                <br>
                <br> Shruti samat hari bhakti path sanjut birati bibek. 
                <br> Tehin na chalhin nar moh bas kalpahin panth anek. 
                <br> Meaning: The path of worship and ascetism based on the eternal philosophy of Vedas, has been oversighted due to the world by attachment and have made so many new paths at their own.

In Vedas God Himself and in shastras the ancient Rishis have preached that peace is only attained when a person worships God as well as disharges all moral duties. Only property/money cannot serve the purpose. You're therefore advised to learn how to perform yagya, daily holy name of God to repeat and yoga asan-meditation. Please seek a local perfect spiritual master who knows Vedas and ashtang yoga philosophy to learn the said worship. Being away I can't teach you. However I have written many spiritual books but I will advice you must study my book named "YAJ KARAM SHARVSHRESTH ISHWAR POOJA" wherein the procedure to perform the yagya with Ved mantras is mentioned.

                <b>David:</b> Your website is very informative and I appreciate your and your teams effort in putting all the information together. Swamiji I have a muslim friend who says that Prophet Muhammad is mentioned by name in different parts of Vedas. I request you to kindly go through this information and tell me if all the references point to prophet muhammad.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> My dear David nameste to you. Vedas have no individual names, please and has no any story even. There are three types of preach--- knowledge(science in Rigveda), deeds (type of all moral duties in yajurveda) and Upasana (worship in Saamveda) and medical science including extra detailed knowledge of God in Atharvaveda. This may be known that when we study mathematics then we study the fundamental of formula etc., and no personal name or any story. Vedas is a knowledge emanates direct from God at the time of unsexual creation. 
                <br>
                <br> Such question was also sent to me on this web site. The gentle man mentioned atharvaveda mantra number 20/127/ 1 quoting word NARASHANSA, he said that its meaning is Respected Hazrat Muhammad Sahib, who will take avtar. The meaning of Narashansa is he who is adorable by all human beings.This meaning is told by an ancient Muni Yaska, in his holy Granth Nirukta 9/6, he says in Sanskrit, "YEN NARAH PRASHANSYANTE SAH NARASHANSO MANTRAH", ITS MEANING IS THAT by whom the men are praised that mantra is called Narashasa mantra. The devta of this Atharvaveda mantra NARASHANSA. Accordingly the meaning in the above mantra of word NARASHANSA is adorable God, who is always praised by human beings. This pious word NARASHANSA has been quoted in other Vedas also, for example Rigveda mantra 1/18/9 is NARASHANSAM SUDHRISHTMAM APASHYAM SA PRATHASTAMAM. DIVO NA SADMAMAKHSAM. 
                <br>
                <br> The meaning is, "I (na) like the light from sunlight emitting heavenly bodies, (sadmamkhsam) in all human beings and other living creatures reside, (Saprathastamam) who is omnipresent with all the biggest space and other maters, (sudrishtamam) who holds the creration well, (narashansam) who is adorable/praised by all human beings, i.e., God., (apashyam) is realized by me. So is the meaning of above quoted mantra which had already been explained by me on this site. However, it is to be noted that God is always realized by controlling all senses, perceptions and mind by virtue of daily eternal worship and hard practice of ashtang yoga. 
                <br>

                <b>Biren Chokshi:</b> How the calculation of time in Vedas and what is importance of eyes dipper (called pal) in Hindi or in Gujarati? What is the importance of mahurt and how it derived in Vedas?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The calculation of time in Vedas are from sun and moon, please. Moon has Krishna paksh and shulk paksh each of 15 days. And so is the sun from which month and time is known. 
                <br>
                <br> Every creation has its own importance. If there would have been no pal (eyelid) then there would have been no rest of eye's pupil and no sound sleep with closed eyes, no merriment while embracing son, daughter or any other etc. And there are so many signs are created with closed eyes and even with open eyes. 
                <br>
                <br> In Rigveda mantra 1/164/12 there is knowledge of KSHANN (moment of time), Muhurat , prahar, ahoratr, week and month. The earth moves round the sun from which days and night are made, which are called ahoratr. From this 8 prahar (I prahar= 3 hours) and 30 muhurats are made. In one ahoratr there are 24 hours.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Your question is great, I have answered such questions so many times on this web site. There is only one Almighty God. Actually about God, God knows Himself only. For example you know yourself until you tell about yourself the other people will not be knowing you. Similarly if God do not tell about Him then how anyone will be able to know Him? Actually there is a philosophy of origin of Vedas. This philosophy is also on this web site and I would request you to study the full philosophy. If you're not in a position to trace then I shall paste it next time. In short I the beginning of the earth God originates a philosophy of four Vedas in the heart of four rishis. Afterwards the Rishis-Munis who get the knowledge traditionally have been preaching the Vedas. In Vedas there is only one formless God who is almighty, omnipresent, omniscient, beyond calculation and beyond imagination, He creates, nurses and destroys the universe. This all has been preached by God in Vedas. In Vedas there is method of worship and the philosophy of karmas etc. and even whole knowledge of creation, science , karmas , upasana, etc. So, God has given His name, qualities, nature, deeds, etc., in Vedas. We have to obey the preach of Vedas emanates direct from God. And we must worship only one formless Almighty God, who creates, nurse and destroys the universe and who is only the Commander of the universe to rule.

Secondly, better if we remember the holy name of God, please. However your views according to your thinking are good.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Manusmriti give the proof in its chapter one that present time of the earth is 7th Manvantar up till now 6 manvantar have passed. Those are Swayambhar, Swarochisch, Ottmi, Tamas, Ryivat and Chakshash, know its 7th manvantar. 
                <br>
                <br> 71 chaturyugi = 1 manvantar. 
                <br>
                <br> There are four yug--- Satyug, Treta, Dwapur and Kaliyug. 
                <br>
                <br> Satyug = 17 lakhs 28 thousands years
                <br> Treta = 12 lakhs 96 thousands years
                <br> Dwapur = 8 lakhs 64 thousands years
                <br> Kaliyug = 4 lakhs 32 thousands years 
                <br>
                <br> The total of four Yugas comes to be 43 lakhs and 20 thousands years which is equal to one Chaturyugi. 71 Chaturyugi i.e., 30 crore 67 lakhs and 20 thousands years equal to one Manvantar and 6 Manvantar have yet passed whose calculation comes to one Arab 84 crore 30 lakhs and 20 thousands years. This is 7th Manvantar and 28 Chaturyugi and the present Kaliyug has passed its time of 5002 years. So up till now the age of the earth and Vedas is one Arab 96 crore 8 lakhs 53 thousands and 2 years. Bhagwat Geeta shlok 8/17 also says about this fact.

                <b>Bipin Badheka:</b> Swamiji, according to Vedas, there is one almighty GOD as per whose wish this universe is running, but who created this GOD? OUR GOD came from where and how he obtained this immense power to create this universe including number of stars, sun, planets etc.? Could you guide please. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> In this connection Kapil Muni in his Samkhya Shastra sutra 1/32 states, "Mule-Mulabhawat- Amulam Mulam", the idea of said sutra is there do not exist root of root. i.e., Almighty God is a reason of creation but there is no reason (root) of creating God. Suppose somebody has made (reason) the God then the builder will be considered God. And this process will have no end, which is not possible. So in Vedas there are three matters which are reasonless, God, souls and prakriti, which are eternal and reasonless, i.e., nobody has created them. That is why, in Yajurveda mantra 2/26 the God has been stated "SWAYAMBHU" i.e., eternal and reasonless. God is omnipresent and the law or system do not apply in respect of God to come and go etc. He is called Almighty, so He has all eternal powers of creation, nursing and destruction etc., etc., automatically. He is independent and needs no assistant, being Almighty. He has unlimited qualities/powers, that is why He is called that He is beyond imagination, beyond calculation and beyond description.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes please you're always welcome. As per Vedas/shastras the ashtang yoga philosophy is learnt personally. Otherwise may be harmful. All must obey the Vedas. So it should be learnt personally. Secondly in Yog Shastra also while commenting Vyas Muni says, "Veden Yogah", i.e., until Vedas are learnt and spread yoga philosophy is of no use. For example if one praises his children and loves, nurses them properly but does not praise and care about his parents then surely he has created a sin. Because he was born with the blessings of his parents and then he became able and marry and see his children. So without yoga there is no any existence of yoga philosophy. Atharvaveda mantra 12/5/40 strictly warn not to take piece meal education from Vedas, which is oftenly is being done specially in the case of ashtang yoga philosophy. One should first praise and spread the eternal knowledge of Vedas and then tell about yoga subject. Lodging and boarding are free please. However donation will be accepted cheerfully.

While meditating sometimes spiritual good experiences and sometimes thoughts full of illusion occur. So one should be careful and should try to take advises accordingly to know the fact. Actually when aspirant starts meditation in his mind, thoughts about materialistic articles of the universe arise which is in Yoga shastras is called VITARAK SAMPRAGYAT SAMADHI when it is continued firmly and daily then it is overcome and next stage starts. So please continue the real meditation to overcome your thoughts.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> I think Ved truly states that Yagya, jaap of holy name of God, while discharging moral duties, always help and protect. Please try to remember both times gayatri mantra with its meaning and it will be better if you could perform havan from Gayatri mantra daily. As regards God in Vedas it is said SHAM NAH ARYAMA , the mantra is big but I am writing in her short. ARYAMA means SUPREME JUDGE. In Yajurveda mantra 7/48 it is preached that we are free to do any deed good or bad but result is always awarded by God accordingly. If In some cases new bad deeds arise, (may be the case of your beloved father by hidden enemy, then even enemy will be punished by God). So God can never be blamed. However, YOUR mother IS GREAT AND I THINK THERE ARE GOOD AFFECTS ON YOU OF YOUR spiritual hearted MOTHER. Actually the Vedas are eternal knowledge direct from God and I would really like to refer my Vedic article to know the real picture of spiritualism, please. Please go through the article and then put your question if any. I would also like to advice you to study my two or three books on Yoga, Yaj karam Sarvshresth Ishwar pooja and Geeta which will be sent to you ,free of cost which really give you and your mother a peace. All books are in Hindi, please but two books on Yoga--- YOGA A DIVINE VEDAS PHILOSOPHY are in English. Actually when we say pious deeds the knowledge of pious deeds are obtained from Vedas. And the best pious deeds is to perform Yagya. the meaning of Yagya are three. i.e., to do services of mother, father, atithi, acharya, and God (detailed description is in book), to take spiritual and worldly true knowledge from acharya and third is donation towards true path. So your daily jaap of Gayatri mantra and havan thereof and study of above quoted book will inspire you to do pious deeds and surely give peace to your whole family. This pious eternal deed will be enlightening you towards a bright future.

                <br> The word Hindu used for whole of the citizens live in India across Sindhu River. This word first time used by Greeks and Unanis thereafter Arabian and Farsis used this word so in reality Hindu means all the citizens whether Sikh, Muslim, Christian or others are called Hindus. Just like in America all type of citizens live there but are called citizens of USA. Now a days it is called that Vedas, shastras, Geeta Ramayan and some other holy books of Sanskrit languages are related to Hindus. Vedas are the ancient holy knowledge of the world given direct from God always at the time of creation. I have written a lot about this and would request you to please read full concerned web site. However, shunya (zero) is created but God is not made by anybody else instead Almighty God creates universe. Shunya is also space, which is also created by God. So God is above space beyond calculation, beyond imagination and beyond description. Yet God has unlimited qualities for example Yajurveda mantra 40/8 says that God is everywhere, He has no shape, no nervous system, nobody can make hole in Him, He is Almighty and does not require any assistance from anybody else. He is eternal, self sufficient, can not be seen with eyes, beyond mind, He creates universe, nurses and destroy and again nurses and again creates. Just a small portion of His power creates universe and His great quality is also this that the whole universe which is seen by us is nothing because the Almighty God is greater than this creation, He gives birth according to our deeds ( karmas) He is spectator of all karmas being omnipresent and omniscient, etc., etc., etc. that is the God has unlimited qualities and powers.

                <b>Rahul:</b> Atharvaveda says dreams are false but in Valmiki Ramayan several places significance of dream is mentioned. Like Bharat had bad dreams when he was with his mama. It signified Dasarath's death. Similarly, some more dreams are mentioned. Doesn’t it contradict Atharvaveda?
                <br> Atharvaveda mantras say that dreams are painful and are as painful as arthritis' pain. But in the age of Bharat, Bharat loved his father a lot and Dashrath too. So in such cases telepathy system occurs. Dashrath had to go heavenly abode and surely he was also remembering Bharat and Bharat too. With the result Bharat saw painful dream. However to say that dreams are false is that if someone sees himself a king in the dream or any other dignitary but on awakening he will find himself as he was.

You had said about a religious leader and his philosophy is incorrect. Does it not amount to 'Ninda'? Why should you talk so about others?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Everybody has right to say the truth. So to tell the truth is not Ninda. Ninda means that one has the good qualities and another one is telling against his good qualities. But if someone is against the fundamental law of Vedas then one has a right to speak truth, it will not be a Ninda. Now the time is changed and influence of Vedas is not more in our country or the world. Otherwise the idea of Rigveda mantra1/1/2 and Nirukta holy book shlok 13/12 state to invite peaceful and cheerful discussion (shashrarth) to establish the truth, which is not possible now. So no any learned person can tell lie. I am not against the Baba but every learned person does not agree with any statement against the Vedas. Suppose anyone tell against your good qualities/truth then surely you'll object.

                <b>Bharat:</b> Swamiji Namaskar. I have gone through your website and am quite impressed by the way you answer the question asked. Though I have earlier also asked some questions, but still there are some questions which are agitating my mind. I would request you just not to quote Vedas while giving answer to these questions because I just want your rational opinion. If I truly love God, then do I need a mediater (Veda) to reach him. Can someone really teach us how to love God? Because love is not done it happens. Reading books will only make our love artificial. How far I am true?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> You're always welcome please. To realize the truth and to do real love with God the reality and the real path i.e., way to realize is first to be understood by a spiritual Vedic master. Vedas teach us to make true love with God. So we must listen Vedas. The attraction is always there within opposite sex to create love and it happens. But this is worldly example. But as regard true love with God and too good being formless, omnipresent etc., the said example is not applicable. And therefore to be indulged with love of God, attraction (his qualities to attract) are mentioned in Vedas which are to be listened. Reading books will not serve the purpose but it is an eternal law of God that Vedas are always listened from a learned.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Bharat:</b> As far as idol worship is concerned, I personally believe that "Ja ki rahi bhavna jaisi, prabhu moorat dekhi tin taisi" that means that we can perceive God in any form (or formless). It is actually our feelings, love and devotion which takes/unites us to the God. What is your view?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Bhavana is originated in mind based on some preach/talk etc., whereas true worship demands eternal philosophy of Ved/shastras and after attaining the knowledge thereof, the bhavna is changed and is concentrated on one truth. And God is formless too. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Bharat:</b> Thirdly, in your website you have discarded black magic. But here I am sorry to raise one question, if by reciting a mantra one can raise the level of positive (spiritual) energy in his body (as well as in his aura) and that energy can also be raised from mooladhar chakra to Sahastrar Chakra for the ultimate kundiline jagran (through pranayam and by visualising/imagining that the kundlini is rising upwards), then negative energies can also be raised (either by wrong pronunciation of mantra or by any other method). If it can be done then these negative energies can also be directed towards others (through telepathy or by visualization). I am saying so because it is actually the thought power which works. If you can make a yoga with God then why not with others? That is why I persist on the fact that other person can harm our interest with mere ill willed thoughts and if is backed by powerful mantras, it can cause someone lot of harm. Kindly throw some light on the issue. I again apologize for asking such a question which is not of spiritual nature.

So God has briefed science in Vedas being eternal Guru, as is also clarified by Rishi Patanjali in his Yog shastras sutra 1/26. now this will be your hard working/interest to study Vedas and invent. I have so many times written on the web site that the four Vedas can be dispatched from here. As regards myself I am still a student of Vedas, please. I have written so many times, A story is written by ancient Yask Muni that Rishi Kashyap was about to die at the age of 100 while studying Vedas. He prayed God to increase his age up to 200 years to study Vedas as he (Kashyap Rishi) was not satisfied with the result of study of Vedas. When again death was to come at his age of 200 years, he again requested God to increase age up to 300 years for more study of Vedas and he was still not satisfied. Again when death was about to come at the age of 300 years then Kashyap Rishi prayed God the O God I am leaving the body (wish to die) because Vedas are eternal and infinite i.e., having everlasting/endless the deepest knowledge and I am still not satisfied. That is why Rigveda mantra 1/154/16 also states that who is not complete yogi has not attained Asamprgyat Samadhi. He can not realize the reality of any Ved mantra but the worldly meanings. Again Rigveda mantra 1/164/39 says that if somebody has not realized God then what mere study of Vedas will do. Atharvaveda mantas also states that the knowledge of Vedas based on the self requirement and thus in torn out pieces are harmful. That is why, Yajurveda mantra 40/9 clearly sates that those who are not worshipping God according to Vedas and after the science to invent the matters of universe and the prakriti are indulging in endless illusion. Mantra says that the science and the spiritualism both must get progress simultaneously. 
                <br>
                <br> So to be a saint without full knowledge of Vedas i.e., science. Politics, humanity etc., etc., is harmful. And simultaneously to be a scientist alone without knowledge of God,/ spiritualism of Vedas is also harmful. Because neither the such saints nor such scientists will promote the international brotherhood. However based on self enjoyment etc., they will merely tell about brotherhood but they will promote their own views and sects only. This is clearly being seen in the present time. The arms/weapons and other matters organized by science are not fully beneficial to the human beings. Even production in agriculture have been effected then what to talk on other matters.

                <b>Bharat:</b> In one of your answers on your website you said about traitwad i.e. God, Soul &amp; Prakriti. That means all these are different from each other. When we say God is Almighty then a question arises that ...Can God give birth or kill a soul or Prakriti? If He cannot then how can we call Him almighty. Does He enjoy any control over these entities called soul &amp; prakriti? Kindly guide me.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes please all are different from each other. For example potter is different from clay that is why he makes pot. Yet the potter is an alive soul which works through organs but the body and the organs are always different from soul that is why nobody say that he is head or eye etc. He always says he has eye, head nose, body etc. Almighty means God has all powers to create, nurse and destroy the universe. And again he creates. God has all powers to control the universe. God has no assistant to depend. So in Vedas it is said truly that God is commander of prakriti and souls. If we say there was a King Harishchandra then it is clear that King Harishchandra had his public also to rule upon. Without public there is n o king, so if God is alone then there is no use of God by people or by Yogi to attain salvation etc. As regards killing of prakriti and soul by God it is quite impossible. Geeta also says soul and prakriti are immortal. Nobody has made prakriti and soul. Killing is possible of the matter which is made from any matter. The matter which is made definitely it will be destroyed. The each matter of the universe like sun, earth and other matters are made of non-alive prakriti. And therefore are destroyed one day including all human and other bodies.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Gayatri mantra is originated in the heart of four Rishis at the time of every creation with all other Ved mantras. It is in three Vedas i.e., Saamveda, Rigveda and Yajurveda. It has not been made by any Rishis Muni or saint etc. No please. All Ved mantras are from Ved and enlight the human being on different subjects.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> To know the truth our ancient Rishis have advised to tally the matter with Vedas. Because in Vedas there is no mention of word manglik so you need not worry. The people who are not manglik are also suffering from the problems mentioned by you. Shri Ram married Sita after breaking the bow. And nobody saw Shri Ram's teva or Anything. In Mahabhart Yudhisthar married Draupadi by piercing arrow in the eye of a fish (the eye was pierced by Arjuna the younger brother of Yudhisthar)and there was no teva and manglik etc. Savitri married Satyavan at her own wish and no teva or manglik etc. Pandu married Kunti and Madri without teva or manglik etc. Teva means janam patri made by pandit i.e., horoscope. So according to Vedas these are not required and self made story. So please do not worry about manglik etc. future is based on pious deeds, hard working towards a right path and God helps those who help themselves.

                <b>Bharat:</b> In one of the teachings of ISKON group, they say that it is somewhere mentioned in a shashtra that a soul is 10000 times smaller than the tip of our hair. Is it true? What Vedas say in this respect? Kindly give the Veda mantra also in this respect. Sometime back I asked you a question that whether teachings of cult like ISKON, Radhaswami, Sai Baba, can be followed. I am still waiting for the reply. Is there any mention of Buddha as Avatar in our Shastras (I am not talking about Vedas)?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Soul and God are alive and eternal, has not been made by anybody. So Yahurveda mantra 2/26 states that soul and God are SWAYAMBHU. Ayjurveda mantra 7/6 states that O Yogi (soul) you are yourself alone and eternal. In Atharvaveda mantra 10/8/25 the hint about omnipresent God has been stated that God is unseen and we may consider that He is the smallest from tip of a hair. In Shewtashwaro Upanishad chapter 5 shlok 9, it has been mentioned that soul is as smallest as a hundredth piece of tip of a hair and when we take 100th part of the hair and further divides into hundred parts then the 100th part of the hair is the shape of soul. But actually the soul is more than the smallest of the said part of a hair and is invisible too. I can only advice you to follow the eternal path of Vedas. However you're free to adopt any path. Vedic path is direct from God whereas other paths have been made by sects. There are six shastras and 108 Upanishads (only 11 are accepted by learned), Bhagwat Geeta, Valmiki Ramayana and other ancient holy books where there is no mention of any avatar, please.

                <b> Vibhor:</b> If God is omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent then he must be knowing our future that means our future is pre-determined, and that is too is now proved by Quantum Science, and if every thing in this world is pre-determined then the concept of free will is an illusion, please comment.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes God knows everything but luck/future where one has to face the deeds good or bad, is based on the result of past deeds of past lives. Yajurveda mantra 7/48 states that everybody is free to do sin or pious deeds but the result thereof is awarded by God. So result is in the shape of luck. Further all Vedas/shashtras clearly state that luck is in our hand. i.e., if we worship truly then the deeds to be faced in future are totally burnt. In this connection Yog shastra sutra 2/16 and Yajurveda mantra 40/2 also refer. There are three types of deeds (karmas) sanchit, prarabhadh and kriyamann. Suppose one soul has to take birth (body). It means he has to face total number of deeds of his all previous lifes and these deeds are called sanchit karmas. But sanchit deeds are huge/unlimited and can not be faced in one life. So the karmas which can be faced in one life are called prarabhadh (luck-destiny). So God has not made our luck at His own, but Almighty God has taken the deeds which we have already done. Yajurveda mantra 7/48 clarifies that human being is free to do any deed good or bad but God only awards the result. Now the balance deeds from sanchit deeds will be counted in the next life. Now the deeds which we do in our present life day today are called kriyamann. So if we do pious deeds according to Vedas, shastras and holy books and based on pious preaches of rishi Muni/ learned saints then our all sanchit deeds are burnt and we can get salvation. So human beings are free in the matter of doing deed good or bad but result will be awarded by God. so we must worship and do pious deeds under guidance of a learned Guru. So is the case of a child for whom you have mentioned in your question. So one should go always ahead for hard working, pious deeds, worship to make future bright himself. One should always work hard towards aright path. Worship does not mean that we are from discharging our family duties, education, etc., but rather it is a sin. So we have to get progress in both way at a time i.e., spiritualism and worldly progress i.e., science , education , duties towards family etc. So God creates the universe according to his eternal law framed in Vedas which are always unchangeable and unchallengeable. So we have to follow the law of God always to get long happy life.

                <b>KM:</b> Why we come to this world? Why this cycle of birth and death is going on? If the purpose of coming here is to do good/quality work and to realize God then should I think about myself only...and If I have done all things right and realize God too...and got Moksha (may be it'll take my whole life to get) then I'll be there in Parmananda and no need to be born again...but for how much time I'll be there in Moksha? And if I am just thinking about myself to get Moksha because I know the way to go there (say) but what about the other people in this world who even don't know what should eat and what not...because the world is made up of all such type of people...also only myself can't change the world...who will listen to me...and how will I prove that I am right...because the right and wrong are the relative things for somebody...So again the question repeats itself ... what is my aim to come in this world??? Please clarify in detail.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Death and birth according to the deeds are eternal until the whole good or bad deeds are burnt by doing hard practice of ashtang yoga and study of Vedas, the same are not stopped. Human beings mostly take birth to face the result of previous sin/pious deeds. And in the present life they due to illusion do several sins or other deeds to face in the future births. Yajurveda mantra 40/2 states that we should discharge our moral duties and while doing pious deeds according to Vedas we get salvation. So deeds are to be done. The aspirant who gains knowledge of Vedas, ashtang yoga philosophy etc., he usually preaches the people also. So it is up to the people whether they are desirous of worshipping to kill the past deeds to get salvation or not. Mostly people are after materialistic articles/pomp and show etc. Mere talking will do nothing. Why the voice of President Bush, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, our late Prime Minister Indira Gandhiji and the voice of learned Yogis are listened? Because they struggled for their motto and became appropriate person.

In this path guidance of a spiritual master who knows Vedas and ashtang yoga philosophy is needed. Holy name jaap of God helps a lot.

Makarsakranti is a day and all days and nights occur due to sun and moving earth but in Vedas there is no relation of makarsakranti to be considered as any religious day. However the customs are there to be considered and must be followed.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There are two meanings of Som ras one the juice (extract) of all vegetables and second when a yogi attains Asmaprgyat Samadhi then he realizes God within him. This realization emanates utmost unlimited merriment within the heart of yogi. So realization of this merriment is called somras.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Mantra will do nothing in this matter, yet mantra in which prayer is there has some blessings but the blessings will do the needful when we act according to the mantra. E.g. gayatri mantra has a prayer to inspire mind to do noble deeds and to get wisdom for the same. So one will have to work hard to get wisdom then gayatri mantra will do the needful. Mere prayer does nothing. So please continue your prayer but always be quiet with your husband , try to know the problem of your husband to rectify the same. Cooperate with him 100% being your duty. However if possible you may explain your main problem to advise you properly.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> According to Yajurveda mantra 31/11 Brahman or any caste is not by birth but by deeds. So all Vedas say that he is Brahmin who has studied 4 Vedas , has practiced ashtang yoga, has been doing yagya with Ved mantras and at last he has realized God or knows God according to Ved mantras. According to ancient philosophy, such Brahmins mostly used to travel on foot and when they used to reach destination, their feet were full of dust and the Brahmin also became tired. To give rest and pleasure to Brahmin, the feet of such Brahmin used to be washed.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The aahutis are given according to the availability of time only. In family life it may be 11, 21, and so on. In the last the 3 extra aahutis of gayatri mantra are offered. The hawan kund may be of iron or copper, it makes no difference. Only the devotion towards aahuti and interest in Vedas and God has real meaning and effect. In so many places the aahutis are offered in bedi made on earth only. Sankhya shastra has main subject of prakriti. In the first sutra, Kapil muni says that the main object of human life is to remove all three types of sorrows which I have also explained in commentary on yogshastra because after removing the sorrows, the soul realizes God which is called moksha so study of prakriti is also necessary to realize God. I have written about prakriti in yogshastra part-1 &amp; 2. Part 2 of yogshastra is under printing and will be available. I think within 15 or 20 days which will be sent to you by post immediately with other 2 books. My blessings to you, your husband and loving son for long happy life.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> I appreciate your desire, please because this is the motto of human life to realize God through yoga philosophy. However, the eternal knowledge of Vedas states that there are eight fold path of ashtang yoga i.e., Yam, Niyam, Asan, pranayaam, pratyahar, dharna, dhyan (meditation) and Samadhi. So meditation is the seventh stage of ashtang yoga. Naturally, to follow the preach of God in Vedas to attain the best result before meditation, the six paths are required to be learnt. Secondly the yoga knowledge requires to be learnt in the presence of a spiritual master who knows Vedas and ashtang yoga. Otherwise learning of yoga philosophy on TV or from book will sure give the dangerous result. Moreover, we must know that yoga is the eighth fold path of ashtang yoga and yoga means Samadhi, i.e., realization of God. So yoga philosophy is learnt to realize God and not to maintain the health. You see, how long one can maintain the health. Nobody can stop to become old and to meet with death one day. Otherwise, health can be maintained by long morning walk, balance diet, regular exercise and wrestling etc. and diseases can be overcome by taking medical advice. Vedas never state to overcome the diseases from yoga philosophy.

                <b>Dr. Jayavanth Kumar:</b> What is Chitta?
                <br> In all 195 sutras of yoga darshan the word "Chitta" is used for a combination of three elements--- first "Mahat" (intellect), ahankar (relating to egotism) and third "mana". About "mana" bhagwat Geeta says: "CHANCHLAM HI MANAH" (Geeta Chapter 6 shlok 34) Meaning: Mana is unsteady/ inconstant, Arjuna says. We have mentioned above the meaning of "Vritti" is various forms. Now I further define, "various forms" in detail. We receive worldly information through five organs i.e., eye, ear, nose, tongue and skin which is contained by our Chitta. Whatever effects are made on "chitta" by the information, the chitta acts accordingly. So, when a situation arises, our thought relating to the information goes out of our chitta and acts Accordingly." These coming informations and out going thoughts relating to "Chitta" are called "Vritti" i.e., various forms. 
                <br>
                <br>Secondly a person always does pious or bad deeds which he has to bear under the law of God. So the effect of such deeds is also stored on chitta and in future when the result of such deeds is to be faced which is yoga is called Vipak deed then the particular effect of such deed is produced in chitta to be faced. So the faculty which stores the above information and deeds is called chitta.

                <b>Dr. Jayavanth Kumar:</b> How Chitta shuddi done?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> This is a deep question as to how chitta shudhi can be done. In short when an aspirant listens to preach of Vedas and the holy books, does Yaj and after learning 8 fold paths of ashtang yoga. The eternal knowledge of Vedas states that there are eight fold path of ashtang yoga i.e., Yam, Niyam, Asan, pranayaam, pratyahar, dharna, dhyan (meditation) and Samadhi. So meditation is the seventh stage of ashtang yoga. Naturally, to follow the preach of God in Vedas to attain the best result before meditation, the six paths are required to be learnt. Practices the same then he attains the stage of Asampargyat Samadhi. Herein all the effects of chitta i.e., since and pious deed are burnt like a seed in the fire. This is called purification of chitta. However, chitta is non- alive made from three gunas of prakriti. I would advise you please to study my three book--- 1. Question and answer on Vedanta and eternal Vedas' philosophy. 2. Vedanta and Eternal Vedas' philosophy part II. 3. Yoga -A Divine Vedas' Philosophy. And you will get all the answers therein detail.

The above statement is based on story that Shiv ji once desired to create universe. He created Narayann jalashya. From his naval, a flower of lotus emanates. From lotus emanates Brahma. Brahma states that he is bigger than Vishnu and Vishnu says that he is bigger than Brahma. There starts quarrel and the quarrel is interrupted by Shivji in the form of shivling between both. It is decided that who will be able to reach the end point of shivling , he will be considered bigger. Brahma started journey up side and Vishnu downward of the shivling. After some journey Brahma met with tree and cow and requested cow and tree to give evidence that Brahma has found the end of the shivling before Vishnu. Both agreed. There became a voice in space that O Brahma you're liar. So you will not be worshiped only Vishnu ji will be worshipped. Shivji told Brahma and Vishnu that why you started quarrelling. Because I sent you to create universe. Then Brahma and Vishnu told shivji that without material how they can create universe. Then Shivji Maharaj from his matted hair (jata) gave ball of ash to create the universe. Now here one must think deeply that when the world is to be created from matter hair by Brahma and Vishnu, then from where the water, lotus, cow and tree etc., already made.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Actually any pranayaam must be learnt in presence of a Yogi who knows Vedas and ASTANG yoga knowledge. When it is said that the Yogi who knows Vedas it means he only knows the smallest technique of the yoga philosophy from the Vedas. For example in Vedas and Patanjali Yoga darshan there is no mention to do the pranayaam by touching nose. So in the absence of Vedas knowledge people touch nose etc. First of all I will advice you to take medical advice immediately. Secondly you must take butter and curd daily if digested, then take brahmi buti sharbat at least for first 15 days if adjustable then increase it for further 15 days and then write me the result please. If possible you must study Pt. I of Yog Shastra written by me, please, which can be sent on receipt of your postal address.

                <b>S. D. K.:</b> Should one accept willingly if one's children decide to marry someone who is not of the same race or faith as us? In the path of spirituality, we say God is one then why is it that most parents do not approve of their children marrying out of their race, caste or religion? Aren't they setting a bad example as understanding parents?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes inter-caste marriages are permitted in Vedas. But main thing is good qualities of both sides. There is no caste system in Vedas. The children can do bad also. So parents must look after the children that are they having good qualities of both sides and is the boy is well settled to bear the responsibilities. First it is seen due to illusion that there is only a matter of love marriage keeping behind the whole future which requires earning and good qualities to shoulder the responsibilities.

                <b>Priya:</b> I did not take care of my mother properly before the death. So now we all feel guilty of not taking care of our mother. Is this true that God wanted to take her away so he blinded us all including my mother by avoiding her to go the doctor? We all are missing her very much, is she watching us? Can we get in touch with her?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> God helps those who help themselves. So your efforts could give a little bit long life to your mother. So, one should never be lazy in life. Had you taken care and still she would have been died then surely there would be a satisfaction within your heart which is not seen at present. However still Vedas say one should not think more about past and should not weep on any death. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Priya:</b> As per my previous question on our mother's death, we are all devastated. How can we go on without her? I have lost my faith in God. Life seems like very long and lonely without her. I do have kids, yet life seems too hard without my mother. One punditji said based on the time of her death, that she has gone directly to Shivji. I don't know if I can believe it. Also I feel life is terminal and there is nothing after. I don't believe in rebirth as I haven't seen any proof.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> With the result of our own deeds how one must loose faith on Almighty God who has given us human body, family, food, earth and every item for happy life. Without God nobody is able to have peace please. There is only one formless God who creates, nurses and destroys the universe. He is only worshipable. Still the Almighty God says in Vedas to work hard towards right path. As regards rebirth one should think that why newly born baby of human as well as animals or others is afraid of death. If newly born is sentenced to death surely she is afraid of. Why? When she has not met with death and has not seen others death it means she has been experiencing the death in his previous lives. Secondly everybody has to face the result of deeds/karmas. If rebirth is not there then how he will face the result of karmas? Then there will be injustice. But injustice is not there at all.

                <b>K N P Iyer:</b> According to many versions Sri Sri Sathya Sai Baba knows the origin and all past or future of this entire World and the moments. But Sri Baba is bound by the Prarbdha karmas and hence could not interfere with it or alter it. As things have to take place as destined. what is your views? Sri Sai Baba can cure or make a dead man alive and Sri Baba can be seen in two or many places at the time. He can cure any disease. But not doing so. Why? Can you give some reasons for it? For an example Sri Lord Srikrishna (the Poorna Avathar of GOD incarnation or YOGESWARA KRISHNA: But why the Mahabhratha WAR has taken place? Sri Krishna could have had changed the minds of the wicked persons and made them, peaceful and WAR could have been avoided and loss of humanity made nil. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> As per Vedas only one almighty, formless, omnipresent, omniscient God knows about the world. He only creates, nurses and destroy, God never takes any avtar because He is Almighty and do every thing through His unlimited power, His independent, and is not depended on any devi=devta etc. as also said by Patanjali Rishi in Yog shastra 1/24, soul only has to face the result of deeds(karmas) but God is far away to face any type of karmas etc. Sanchit, Prarabhadh and Kriyamaan karmas are only for souls i.e., human being to face and not for God, please. When Sri Krishna Maharaj was returning to Dwarka Puri after the Mahabhart war he met with Uttang Rishi. The Rishi asked Sri Krishna about the welfare of Kauravs and Panadvas (as the Rishi did not know about the war). When Sri Krishna told the rishi about war and death of all Kaurvas and the warriors of the both sides then the rishi became angry and was about to give the shrap to Sri Krishna. The rishi told Sri Krishna, "You went to make compromise but why war took place". Sri Krishna then told that he (Sri Krishna) tried his level best to avoid the war but all in vain. And the war started. This story concludes that Sri Krishna tried his level best. Secondly Vedas do not speak about avtar.

Your comments please.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Whatever is being seen is not permanent. Everything will be destroyed. God, souls and prakriti and the knowledge of four Vedas emanates direct from God are eternal and immortal. However printed books are not Vedas, please, it is called Samhita and will also be destroyed one day.from prakriti the panch bhoot are made and At the time of destruction are merged in their original shape of prakriti. You can say that the whole creation is turned and merged in prakriti but still not destroyed. Science also says from Vedas that matter changes his shape but never destroys. The change of shape is called here, "destroy".

Actually five senses, 5 perceptions and mind are to be controlled for which a spiritual master who knows Vedas an ashtang yoga philosophy is required. One has to perform daily havan from Ved mantras, chanting of Om and Gayatri mantra, practice of ashtnag yoga etc., under guidance of spiritual master. Only fasting will not serve the purpose.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The milk of cow is vegetarian as the milk of the mother to a baby is vegetarian. In all Vedas God has instructed to take the milk. So it is very fully vegetarian. On the other hand God has strictly prohibited any kind of meat. As regards calf, some portion of the milk of cow is to be given and not full. Yes egg is also prohibited. We have to follow the orders of God mentioned in Vedas and not orders of man.

Secondly you must start havan daily which is a great worship of God. You may start from gayatri mantra which is mentioned in three Vedas. I have written all the mantras in a book to perform havan and book can be sent on receipt of your postal address. The book is in Hindi describing Sanskrit Ved mantras in Hindi also along with procedure of performing. However Gayatri mantra with its meaning and the procedure to perform the havan is also placed on this web site. Then I will advice you to please learn yoga philosophy to do first asan, pranayaam and meditation locally. I am away and can not teach you. Every guidance will be provided from here please. A book on yoga philosophy can also be sent to you please.

Being brought up in a different culture and religion, I heard the gayatri mantra for the first time in my life a few days ago. Since that day I have been continuously reciting it and it has made be conscious about many things, changed my habits a lot automatically without having me to push myself for example to become a vegetarian person or with other things as well. My first question is about the timings of recitation as I read that this can be recited only at dawn, dusk and afternoon. Do I have stop if my mind automatically enchants the Gayatri Mantra all day regardless of timing?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Thanking you please. Saamveda mantra 14 states to recite the mantra or to worship the God according to Vedas daily both times i.e., morning and evening. However it is also told that if one recites the mantra in breathing being habitual and without disturbing to discharge moral duties. Then he can recite all the time or as and when suits.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Bhag means he who has unlimited glories, merriment, and power etc. Wan means one who possesses. Certainly he is Almighty God only. Because human being individually or in a bunch has limited glory/wealth and merriment etc., and too is not permanent.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> It is the quality of prakriti which has three qualities --- raj, tam and sato gunnas. The said three gunas has all such type of bad qualities. Soul has a nature of attraction. After taking birth and surrounded by the human body with mind, chitta etc., made by prakriti, the soul has to adopt one path amongst two i.e., bad or good. Mostly due to lack of good preach the soul is attracted towards bad because soul is already surrounded with human body made of prakriti and the materialistic articles of the world too made of prakriti, i.e., bad path. Soul actually requires a spiritual master who knows Vedas and yoga philosophy to guide properly. We lost the will power etc., being attracted towards prakriti and materialistic articles of the world too made by prakriti. We need spiritual advice always to control.

Can any deviation from God/nature's(prakruti) balance either on positive or on negative side be thought as sin, whereas going toward this balance is "punya"?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Rakashas and devas become due to the bad or good deeds respectively and in this process God has no concern. The soul is free to do good or bad deeds. But the result is awarded by God. Soul himself has to decide for good or bad deeds and not prakriti etc. because prakriti is non-alive matter whereas soul is alive one.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> In Vedas the meaning of ashwmegh yagya is a yagya whcvih is performed mostly by kings for the well being of nation. It is to be noted here that ashwa means nation and not horse. Sri Ram performed so many ashwamegh yagya.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> My blessings to you for a long happy life. As regards worship, there is only one formless almighty God. Gayatri mantra must be recited both times and if possible havan from gayatri mantra must be performed daily as it is the best worship of God. Sure it will be beneficial in the life.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> In chapter 31/11 of Yajurveda and in other Vedas also the caste is based on pious or bad deeds of present life and not by birth. It is clear that Vedas never preach about any caste system. Vedas teach for similarity and love to all human beings.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes it is true that all the scientific/spiritual/deeds inventions are originated from four Vedas only. In this connection Manusmriti shlok 2/6 also refers. Suppose a new born baby is nursed in dense jungle but is not provided with any education or is not dealt with any languages. Definitely even at the age of 30-40 or so on he will not be able to talk or follow any language, maths, science etc., because he was not provided with the such education. So the fundamental law comes that knowledge is only attained when it is given by someone. So science, maths or knowledge to write books is first attained. And the source to attain is eternal knowledge of Vedas given direct by God at the time of beginning of the earth to four rishis of unsexual creation and then is spread by rishis, munis traditionally.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Souls and spirits are one and the same. For example water or pani/jal are the name of one matter i.e., water. In Vedas there is only one formless God to worship who creates, nurses and destroy the universe. He is omnipresent, almighty omniscient, beyond calculation and beyond imagination. No one is even equivalent to the God. So due to lack of knowledge of Vedas and practise of ashtang yoga and performing of yajyen from Ved mantras as used to perform in the ancient times the people are performing idol worship.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There is no any kind of sevva dosh mentioned in Vedas, which is eternal knowledge direct from God. Still it is not mentioned in ancient holy books also. So need not to worry. However one should always love each other with soul to soul and not only mere on physical charms. For this one should listen holy preach and do worship while discharging other moral duties. One side to realize truth is God made i.e., Vedas then shastras etc., and second is man made so to fulfill the self motto sarp dosh and other false paths have been created for the last about 5000 years i.e., after Mahabhart war.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> You have been doing worship while doing asan/meditation or study of Geeta etc., so it is a spiritual life and is good for you. Secondly whatever good thoughts are coming is due to your previous lives sanaskaar. Now you need a real spirtual master who knows Vedas and yoga philosophy to solve your problems. Society is not bad and one has to live within the society only. However the evil thoughts within the society like false statement, theft, sins etc., are bad and harmful to the human life. So the said evils are to be left and not society. When you're good then even bad society ill not be able to harm you. Better if person does meditation, worship etc., i.e., spiritual task while living in a family. Sanyaas is only for those who have got the result of worship and have become ascetic. So please seek a spiritual Guru as stated above. I am away and can't teach you there. However I have written some spiritual books and will be sure beneficial for you which can be sent on receipt of your postal address, please.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Actually due to lack of knowledge of spiritualism/Vedas mostly the families have to face trouble, sorrows tension etc., etc. Vedas say to get progress in spiritualism as well as in worldly pious affairs like moral duties, study of science, maths/education etc., etc. Peace is attained only from spiritualism and not only from materialism. So due to lack of spiritual knowledge the human being are mostly after the pomp and show, materialistic articles and glitter etc., etc., and entangled in fraud, greediness, false statement, theft, corruption in the family, society as well as with the nation and world. So please try to obtain spiritual knowledge by listening Vedas preach doing daily havan and practicing asan, pranayaam and meditation under guidance of local/nearest spiritual master. This knowledge must be gained by whole family. If not possible then for the sake of the children please adjust yourself and get the spiritual knowledge alone to get peace.

                <b>Honey Chugani:</b> I have been to many devi mata pujas and havans especially during Navratri. Now Pujya Babaji, do people really go into trance? Does God actually enter their bodies? If so, how can God possess anyone's body? I find it all hard to believe but for courtesy sake I attend these havans and seek these ladies blessings too. I always try my best to do good and whatever I do, be it sewa or whatever my duties or responsibilities, I do them without any selfish motives. I do not expect any kind of gratitude or reward but I just like to help and do good whenever I can. Pujya Babaji, is it true that if we do good in this birth, we have to return back to this earth to reap our punya? I find all this a little difficult to understand. If I do all this with nishkaam bhaav, then why do people say that this will add up to my punya and I have to come back here again. What does all this mean? Out of fear of re-birth am I suppose to be selfish? God this is all too confusing.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The world has been created by Almighty God only. God has made rules and regulations to control the world and He has mentioned the same in Vedas. Whatever there is Vedas all is true. Secondly whatever is there in other holy books according to the Vedas is also true. But all that which is against the Vedas is not true and thus is not accepted. So Vedas do not tell, about such devi and to enter the other body etc. As regards God, He is already omnipresent i.e., everywhere. So who is the next God to come from anywhere to enter the body? Seva/responsibilities. Moral duties are in Vedas and must be discharged according to Vedas. Listening/Study of Vedas and accordingly to do havan daily and practicing asan, pranayaam and meditation is also duty of human being mentioned in Vedas. Then human beings know his moral duties and pious deeds to do. So all this is punya, which further creates and develop knowledge and thus one realizes God. So punya are not baseless. If there will be no punya how will one be a gentle and honest person? So it is false statement being spread that punya must not be done otherwise one will have to come back on the earth. Without punya there is nothing. Nishkaam bhaav will also be gained by doing punya. To avoid rebirth there is a necessity of a Guru who knows four Vedas and ashtang yoga philosophy under whose guidance a disciple gets progress, in spiritualism as well as in family life.

So please try to get up early in the morning for a long morning walk and light exercises daily. The motto of a student is to do hard study and to take care of his health by good qualities. Otherwise he is not a student, he is wasting his life. Please be alert, go ahead and by hard working, concentration. Devotion and dedication makes your future bright.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> God has not made any caste system, in His Vedas. Yajurveda mantra 31/11 states that according to the deeds a person is brahmin, kshatriya etc., and not by birth. Parshuram ji first was a king i.e., kshatriya and afterwards when he left the kingdom and started tapsya in jungle then he was considered a brahmin.

                <b>Suruthi Sriram:</b> Each man is responsible for his karma. No one can change/modify this. So he has to reap his own goal but no one know his karma/ the law of nature. Yogis/mahans know this but they won't tell this. They can help to certain extent to reduce the burden by telling certain parikarams then why so much of nature calamity and other disasters? Is there any way or path to remove this? The only answer is prayer. Am I correct? If so where is karma? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There are three types of deeds( karmas) sanchit, prarabhadh and kriyamann. Suppose one soul has to take birth (body). It means he has to face total number of deeds of his all previous life's and these deeds are called sanchit karmas. But sanchit deeds are huge/unlimited and cannot be faced in one life. So the karmas which can be faced in one life are called prarabhadh (luck-destiny). So God has not made our luck at His own, but Almighty God has taken the deeds which we have already done. Yajurveda mantra 7/48 clarifies that human being is free to do any deed good or bad but God only awards the result. Now the balance deeds from sanchit deeds will be counted in the next life. Now the deeds which we do in our present life day today are called kriyamann. So if we do pious deeds according to Vedas, shastras and holy books and based on pious preaches of rishi Muni/learned saints then our all sanchit deeds are burnt and we can get salvation. So human beings are free in the matter of doing deed good or bad but result will be awarded by God. So we must worship and do pious deeds under guidance of a learned Guru. One should go always ahead for hard working, pious deeds, worship to make future bright himself. One should always work hard towards aright path. Worship does not mean that we are free to discharge our family duties, education, etc., but rather it is a sin. So we have to get progress in both way at a time i.e., spiritualism and worldly progress i.e., science , education, duties towards family etc. God creates the universe according to his eternal law framed in Vedas which are always unchangeable and unchallengeable. We have to follow the law of God always to get long happy life. By doing real worship as per Vedas the karmas are burnt and the person gets salvation.

Everybody say that it is his head, it is his eye etc., nobody says he is head or eye etc. So the relationship between two separate matters. For example father is separate and son is separate that is why father says he is my son. So we say this is our body that is body is separate and we are separate from body. So you' re also an alive and immortal soul residing in the body. Reason to take birth in human body is to realize God to attain salvation. Reason behind everybody wants pleasure and not sorrows, problems, tension or death etc. And without realization of God permanent merriment/salvation is not possible. One will go to the next birth according to his good or bad deeds, if he has not attained salvation, please. The soul is eternal and immortal. So there is no its reason to be.

What is havan samagri? Is there a substitute for this product in case I cant find it? Also I do not have ghee where I am living now, are there any other substitutes for it such as olive oil?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Havan kund is made of iron and you're advised to please contact any local pandit or Arya Samaj Mandir who will tell you about the same. The method of doing havan is placed on this web site and you're requested to kindly locate from the site please. Havan samgri is also available in either Arya Samaj Mandir or kirayana shopkeeper. If not available then you may put question again please. Substitute of ghee is olive oil.

                <b>Aditya:</b> In adwaitvad option,you mention that Vedas support treitvaad means God, soul &amp; prakriti are three different things. Please give me solution of this question. Vedas said that God is Omnipresent &amp; present in the every atom of this world. It means the whole Prakriti is made of God.it means there is no difference between Prakriti &amp; God as both are same.then how is Treitvaad (God, soul, prakriti) is possible?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> God is omnipresent but prakriti and souls have no such qualities as are of God. Prakriti is non-alive whereas God is alive. God is within sun, sun is made of prakriti but sun is not within any worldly matter. Prakriti makes universe, i.e., from prakriti sun, moon, air, human bodies, etc., are made. But the said items are not made of God. So differences are due to the qualities please. If prakriti and God could have been same then God could not be considered omnipresent. God is everywhere. But everything is not God.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Shri krishna studied Vedas and did ashtang yoga practice under guidance of Rishi Sandeepan while staying in his ashram with Sudama and thus Shri Krishna found his name a "yogeshwar". He who attained 'Darmmegh Samdhi' according to Yog Shastra sutra 4/1to 9, he attains moksh and realizes God. Such yogi becomes equivalent to God but not God. He attains all powers from God and can say the words quoted by you, please. Avtarvad is not possible according to four Vedas and I have explained a lot about the same.

                <b>Dr. Udai Narain Sinha:</b> Is there a mention to Chitragupta in Vedas? If so Where? Are Kayasthas Hindu or foreigners? Do the Vedas talk about hell and Heaven or it is an after creation of philosophy to restrain mankind from doing bad or evil to others? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Chitragupt/Yamraj is God himself. No separate Chitrgupt/Yamraj, hell or heaven has been mentioned in Vedas. God being Almighty has all powers to control the universe and requires no assistant being. God is thus fully independent. We, the souls in bodies are dependent. Soul requires eyes to see, ears to listen, nose to smell, tongue to taste, legs to walk, hands to work, mind to think, etc., etc., but not God because God is independent. So God does not require any Chitrgupt or any devi-devta to create, nurse or destroy the universe. God is himself empowered. Secondly this earth is itself hell, or heaven. Souls take bodies according to good or bad deeds. So to face bad deeds with problems, tensions, sickness or other worries etc., is hell and to face the result of good deeds in the shape of happiness, merriment with good worldly articles etc, is heaven. However one has to cross such heavens also to attain salvation.

                <b>Ashish:</b> In my social circle I happen to see quite a few people offering their hair to God diligently once every year i.e. they go for their annual mundan. What is the physical/emotional and most importantly spiritual benefits of "Annual Mundan" for an adult man? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There are two types of worship at present. First God made and second made by prophets etc. Vedas are the knowledge direct from God and not man. In Vedas the mundan ceremony is once is performed when a child is of three years plus. The ceremony is even performed by organising Vedic yagya and therefore is considered pious effect on the mind of the child for a bright future. Thereafter no such ceremony is performed according to Vedas.

                <br>
                <b>Sushil Khandelwal:</b> The only the human body is blessed by the GOD to search its own guru. This shows that all the animals not need any guru they are blessed by the God directly. Again it is a minus point for us. Giving the example of sourcing the water in the jungle, there is no question of sourcing because as per our belief, a living body is made of five elements and the water is one of them. So where the water is so there is the life whether it is animal or human and mind you human is also a social animal and water is not the God.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Animals comes in bhog yoni i.e., they can create any new deeds at their own. And human beings comes under Karam Yoni i.e., we are free to do any good or bad deeds at our own as per Yajurveda mantra 7/48. So it is clear that animal needs no guru to do new deeds of worship etc., but they have to face the result of their deeds only of previous lives. Water is even searched even by human beings to live upon otherwise all will die. If a man even in a home will not search water and go to kitchen to take he will also die one day. Animal is animal and human beings are human beings so there is difference between human beings and animals. Animals are not social. They have not provided with such mind. Only to learn the phrases will not learn the purpose. Vedas including every religious book shout that human body is valuable than animals.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Water is considered the purest element. So with mantra it is touched with the pray to God that our body parts become pure and strong etc. Fore finger generally point out the faults of others showing the finger towards the particular person. Whereas other three fingers duly bent indicate towards oneself. So mostly forefinger is not used.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> There are two kinds of Vedanta. Vedanta shastra written by Vyas Muni which is according to Vedas. Second is new Vedanta which says that soul and everything is God. And they say, "AHAM BRAHM ASMI".

The concept in both the revelation appear to be completely different, Can you write to me your opinion on both the concepts as both are divinely inspired from one God Almighty so what could be the logic for these differences. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes please. Hell and heaven are there but the definition of the hell in Vedas is to face the result of bad deeds in the form of sorrows, problems, sickness, and other serious problems, etc. by taking births again and again. And heaven means to enjoy happy life with all assets etc. on this earth. Third stage is moksh in which soul remains with God and enjoys merriment.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The correct word is, "Sachidanand", please. And sachidanand is not a mantra. Sat means truth, which is immortal and here this is God, chit means chetan i.e., alive who is also God. And anand means who has unlimited merriment to shower on aspirant and He is also God. So all the said qualities are of almighty, omnipresent, omniscient, and immortal God who has actually unlimited qualities.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Falsehood is originated from false. False is that which is generated on date and time, takes growth and then finished. For- example a mango tree is generated, takes growth, growth is stopped one time then tree starts its deterioration and then finished. Same is with human body, sun, moon, earth and every materialistic article of the world. Mainly false is illusion which is generated from prakriti's three gunas i.e., raj, tam and satv gunn from which human, animal, birds, bodies earth, moon, sun, air water and every smallest and the biggest article of the universe is made, so illusion to the soul is produced by the said three gunnas. Due to ignorance soul is attached with illusion. Soul in original, no doubt is immortal, alive the purest and detached from every illusion but soul has forgotten his original shape and thus indulged in illusion. A Vedic guru and Yogi is essential to preach the soul.

                <b>Anonymous:</b> I have two children who are girls. My brother also has girl childs. There are no boys in family. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> We all live in this world where actually importance of money, pomp and show and sons etc., are only considered and that is why the humanity is being crushed. The people who are having lot of money, sons, buildings, status, etc., etc., have no real happiness. And this is only due to lack of eternal knowledge of Vedas. In Vedas importance is considered for truth only. Nowadays so called gurus also based on bookish knowledge only teaches truth that soul is immortal, etc., etc., but most of them need unlimited money, sons, building, cars, aeroplane's journey and all valuable assets also. So it is a surprising that duly indulged with illusion most of the present saints talk to keep the people away from illusion. So our eyes must be on truth and truth is soul and God and not body. In Vedas there is no difference between boy and girl, because body is boy and girl, and not soul. Soul resides in body, therefore even animals, birds etc., are pitiable by human beings, because their bodies have the same soul. King Janak has two daughters only, Mata Sita and Urmila he had no son, the King Janak with his own qualities and the good qualities which he gave to his daughters is being remembered uptil now. On the other hand Bhisham pitamaha, Bal brahamcharini Gargi, who was king Janak's guru, Yagvalkya Muni having two wives had no issue but due to their tapsya and good qualities the said dignitaries are being remembered. Five Pandavs i.e., Yudhishtir, Bhim, Arjuna, Nakul and Sahdev had five sons and their sons were died in young age but Panadvas are still remembered due to their own good qualities about knowing truth from Vedas. 
                <br>
                <br>So your two loving daughters are adorable. Kindly try to give them highest education and Vedic knowledge too. Yet you may take one more chance to get son if you're still desirous of. You should do daily havan from Gayatri mantras. And must recite Gayatri mantra both times daily. IMPORTANCE BEING CONSIDERED OF HAVING SON NOW A DAYS IS TOTALLY BASELESS AND AGAINST THE VEDAS.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Certainly women may mind but the question of life is main and such things are ignored. As regards religious items it depends on particular person that whom he worships. For example if Hindu worship formless God then they prefer reciting OM within their heart and so on. This is also a matter of personal faith in case of death while operating. A Hindu worshipping formless God and considering Vedas he will do nothing more except taking the body for cremation with family and related and other lovers. Some Hindus will take the body to a particular place Pehwa tirth etc., because the patient died on the table or bed etc., and so on.

Then Shri Ram told before everybody that he (Shri Ram) knew that Sita was the purest and can never think about any other person except him, but nobdoy knew the said fact due to which he asked Sita to go to pyre for knowing the purity of Sita by all. Shri Ram added there that he cannot separate Sita as a learned, wise, and glorious person cannot leave his qualities/fame. This is a proof that Shri Ram then never separated Sita.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Havan is always started by reciting gayatri mantra please.

                <b>Tejas:</b> I read one sentence somewhere that Bahirang yog (yam, niyam, asana and pranayam) makes overall development in one's personality. Is it true? How? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No please. Yam to pratyahar are bahirang sadhan which makes an aspirant to control indiriyan. Yoga is always meant for realization of God and not meant for only good health and what a good health will do at last that is at last the health will have to go to pyre. And whose motto is to get good health from yoga that means he is after the good health to attract world with bad senses that is pride, etc.

My question is why not a brahmin (lady) is called for shrard for my grand mother? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Actually sharadh means to serve the parents, atithi and acharya (all alive) by providing food, clothes, money and all other good articles but not after death please being against the Vedas.

                <b>Smita:</b> We get to know how brutally someone or the other is killed, murdered, etc. I remember guruji you have said one who performs yagya daily, practise yoga, pranayam and meditation slowly slowly he/she is forgiven for all his/her past bad deeds but guruji last time I asked you about a saint who was killed by his disciple who use to give him slow poison everyday.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Every yogi who has attained dharammegh samadhi is yogeshwar like Vyas Muni etc. it makes no different whether he is called yogi or rishi or muni, etc. Shri Krishna also learned four Vedas and did practice of ashtang yoga and called yogi/yogershwar/bhagwan etc. However avtarwad is not possible.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> One must study Vedas in this regards please. Rig Veda mandal l0 states that the religion was and is humanity which was known at that time with the word ARYA. Learned Mattaerlic in his book, "The Great Secret", has written, "let us once give ear To Rig-veda, the most authentic echo of the most immortal traditions, let us note how it appreciates the formidable problem. 
                <br>
                <br> "There was neither, being nor non-being, there was neither atmosphere, nor heavens above the atmosphere. What moved, and whither? And in whose care? Where there waters and the bottomless deep? " there was then neither death nor immortality, the day was not divided from the night. Only one breathed in himself without extraneous breath and apart from him, there as nothing. There for the first time desire awoke within him, this was the first seed of the spirit. The sages, full of understanding, striving within there hearts, discovered in non-being the link with being." (Rigveda 10.129.1,2,4)

                <b>Arun:</b> Please explain the meaning of the following sutra: “Anavrittih shabdadanavrittih shabdat( Braham sutra).”
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Vedanta shastra sutra 4/4/22 is ANAVRITTIHI SHABDADANAAVRITTHI SHABDAT. Its meaning is Anavritti = not returns, shabdat = from shabd. Here shabd means the proof of words mentioned shastras/Vedas. So this is idea of a Rishi to say about a soul who has got salvation that the soul will not return on earth by taking birth etc. But the shabd proof vide Rigveda mantras 1/24/1,2 that after expiry of the time of salvation, the soul will take rebirth. However, the peroid of Moksh is so lengthy that Vedas too say that salvation means to get, "Amrit" etc.

                <br>
                <b>Rashmi Sahu:</b> One question I would like to ask why so many yogis only take birth in our country whereas western countries it is not there. I will give an example , yourself, swami vivekananda, swami ramkrishna param hansa, shri Gajanan maharaj, shirdi Saibaba, swami Nityanand, Swami Samarth, swami Ramtirtha etc. This land is very pious I think. Swamiji we have been doing havan with my husband on holidays as guided by you. We know sanskrit, but at times pronunciation mistakes are committed. Will God forgive our mistakes? Both of us are trying to lift ourselves up spiritually by deeds and knowledge too. But routines at times are tough. Swamiji what are your new books please? Do bless me with knowledge of Veda and your books.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes please you're right. As per Manusmriti and other authentic ancient holy books the creation (mankind) was started only from Tibet, whose ancient name was Trivishtap. Thereafter, our forefathers started coming to the present India. And the most of the yogis, rishis and Munis learnt Vedic and Yoga philosophy here. International University which was famous as Nalanda and Takshila where students from whole of the world used to come to study Vedas and Yoga philosophy and other subjects, was in India only. 
                <br>
                <br> It is the best holy deed that is havan which you're performing, Like Shri Ram and Mata Sita etc. I send my blessings to your family for a long happy life. Second part of Yog shastra has now been completed by the grace of almighty God and My Guru Maharaj. Now it is in printing press. And proof reading are expected here by coming Saturday. Yet I feel with addition and alteration etc., the book will take at least one month in completion. One another book named Atmik Udgar is being printed second time with some additions. And a book based on Shaeri (poetry) having my emotional heart feeling which I had been writing up to 1978 has also been printed and the said two books will be here in Yol on coming Saturday. The Shaeri book is to be printed on request of some disciples.

                <b>Shaym Kaushik:</b> What is life? I am so confused about concept of life. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Actually life is a struggle which we all have to face bravely, happily and while discharging all moral duties at our level best. Life requires always hard-working towards pious deeds under guidance of spiritual Guru, who knows Vedas and Yoga philosophy. Then there will be no any problem in the life i.e., problem will be killed slowly-slowly. The problems and bad feelings are only due to the result of our own deeds (good or Bad) of the past lives. The deeds are only burnt by real worship and pious deeds according to Vedic philosophy. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Prasannaa:</b> I am South Indian and I am learning Vedas. I have come across some facts that I have viewed in sites. Some Muslim people claim that name of prophet Muhammad occurs in Atharvaveda and Rigveda and match that kalki avatar is non another than Muhammad. What I think is that this thing is done to remove Hindu people from their path. What is your view?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The same question was answered by me several times that God being almighty and independent too, needs no any avtar to shoulder His duties to others. Soul is dependent i.e., we are dependent to do any job. We need eye to see, ear to listen, tongue to taste and talk, leg to move and hands to do job etc., etc. But God needs nothing being Almighty. Narashansha pious word is mentioned in atharvaveda kand 20 sukta 127, the meaning of said word is, "who is praiseworthy amongst human beings". So in this category either God or an alive king comes, who look after the public well.

                <b>Raj Bhalla:</b> After the mantra, Om Aditeanumanyasav, what is the significance of putting water on the east side? Then water is put on the west, north and all around the havan kund. What do these signify? Please explain.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Aditya means the sun rises from east. Aditi means which is never destroyed. Anumanyasav means to be accepted by all. So the sense of putting the water towards east is that the learned who are towards east must accept the pray to God that the yajman may get progress in every step of life etc. Anumati means every person, Saraswati means learned person must accept the performance of yajna that the yajna is an eternal pious deed and yajman must get happiness etc., etc. The sense of putting water round the havan kund is that any insects should not cross the water otherwise they will touch the hot havan kund and may die. Actually a small portion of earth is dug to make drain in which water is filled. So that insects are not able to cross the drain.

My question is chronologically can we consider Quran to be the last and final revelation?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Islam accepts holy Quran a final revelation and other religions must also take holy preach of Quran to promote international brotherhood. But every religion will automatically consider its own path, please. Whole religions of the earth have good and pious eternal preaches and everybody must obey.

Because rest of the time is to work hard to earn money for family. However if somebody has time he may recite the mantra any time with its meaning while sitting on asan for meditation. Gayatri mantra is recited in mind with its meaning concentrating on agya chakr, tip of the nose or in heart. Yes please the mantra can be recited or heard by girl or ladies.

                <b>Abdulwadud:</b> As salamu alaykum swamiji, I have little knowledge of Vedas which say about worshipping a formless God who is above human imagination and interestingly thats what Quran talks about. But due to the unaccessibility of Vedas and unavailability of knowledgable preachers we see most of the hindus resorting to human made Gods which is sinful according to both Vedas and Quran. The uniqueness of Quran is quiet simple ie: "PRESERVATION THROUGH PRACTICE", which unfortunately is not the case with Vedas. The recitation of Quran is obligatory for all muslims starting at the tender age of 5-7 as that is the age when religious values can be easily imparted. I do know about some Vedic schools teaching Vedas to children at the same age but not obligatory which is a cause of concern. My question to you is the Vedas that are availble now are they Original in their text and contents. If yes can you recommend some of the best english/hindi/urdu translations of all 4 Vedas. My knowledge about Vedas is that they are divinely inspired and they are termed as SHRUTHI,and other scriptures like Upanishads,Puranas etc are Human handiwork and are called as SMRITI. Please correct me if I am wrong. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Salam Walekum please. Yes please Vedas and Quran both holy Granths tell worship of a formless Almighty God. Realization of God is always achieved by hard practice of true path preached in both the holy Granths. In Vedas also the holy preach is adopted even before taking birth of soul by performing garbhdhan sanskaar and when soul comes in womb of mother then holy worship in the shape of Puansvan sanskaar then sanskaars are continued and at the age of 6 Upnayan and Vedarambh sanskaar are performed. Now it is up to every person whether they perform or not. Due to lack of knowledge of Vedas mostly the people ignore. Yes Vedas are original please. The preach of Vedas had been essential uptil Mahabhart war, ie., about 5300 years back. Then the period within 2 to 2 1/2 thousand years came wherein present saints also following the path of 2- 2 ½ thousand years back have started saying that Vedas are difficult and yagya are needed not etc., etc. and thus the eternal preach of Vedas have been finished, which is even is a great sin. I can only recommend translation by Swami Dayanand Saraswati in Sanskrit and Hindi.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Gayatri mantra is the best please. But still the mantra will not give you immediate relief being a case of depression/tension. You're advised to do havan even from gayatri mantra, daily both times. Though it will also not give immediate relief but sure will help to ease the problem slowly-slowly. Medical advice is also necessary. However the best way is to learn asan, pranayaam and meditation locally because I am away and can not teach you. Pranayaam will sure give you relief. But see that asan, pranayaam, meditation and havan are in addition to medical advice. You must also try to study spiritual books daily. I have also written some books on Vedas and can be sent if you're desirous of.

I found out that Quran is the only book that has remained unchanged and uncorrupted preserving the concept of One ness of God and more interesting the Gayatri Mantra which is a sacred mantra according to Vedas is quiet similar to Surah-Fatiha in Quran which all muslims read in their 5 times prayers.

In this regard a mantra in Vedas is also there. On the other hand Ravan was a son of rishi and Shurapnakha was his sister but they did not do pious deeds. But as per Ved mantra in their childhood sure they had been listening Ved mantras and with the result in future lives they will sure be attached with spiritualism.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes please. To know the truth our ancient Rishis have advised to tally the matter with Vedas. Because in Vedas there is no mention of word manglik so you need not worry. The people who are not manglik are also suffering from the problems mentioned by you. Shri Ram married Sita after breaking the bow. And nobody saw Shri Ram's teva or anything. In Mahabhart Yudhisthar married Draupadi by piercing arrow in the eye of a fish (the eye was pierced by Arjuna the younger brother of Yudhisthar) and there was no teva and manglik etc. Savitri married Satyavan at her own wish and no teva or manglik etc. Pandu married Kunti and Madri without teva or manglik etc. Teva means janam patri made by pandit i.e., horoscope. So according to Vedas these are not required and self-made story. So please do not worry about manglik etc. future is based on pious deeds, hard working towards a right path and God helps those who help themselves.

And he used to call his disciple Gorakh Nath ji as Avdhoot. Secondly Geeta is one only written by Vyas Muni that too is an extract from Mahabhart Bhisham Parv. Other Geetas have been written by present saints and they can name whatever they like. The tradition to learn Vedas is something else i.e., one will have to live with his guru. Will have to learn Ashtadhayi, Mahabhashya, Sanskrit Grammar, etc., which is impossible for you being away and in family life. So second procedure is to study Ved mantras with its meaning and ideas and one must learn even for week or 15 days, asans, pranayaam and meditation to practice the same in home.

What was their fault? Why wasn't their God available for them? This all makes me feel we all are following our lives to pre-determined destiny. The concept of God and prayer are just man-made to support each individual (if s/he believes in God) in their pre-determined journey. It may or may not help. If you help others and have never harmed any other living being; does it matter if you believe in God or not?

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Your views are appreciated please. First of all you must try to perform all the best sanskaars from Ved mantras placed on the web site. For example, before pregnancy garbhadhan sanskaar is essential and then others which sure affects the baby to be a learned one in future. Then you must daily perform havan even from Gayatri mantra. After delivery there are so many good preches given by mother specially which may kindly be asked lateron. Mother always be pleasant, studying spiritual books, doing name jaap and havan and thinking always good ideas.

                <b>RGA:</b> As per your answer to the query whether polygamy is allowed by the Vedas, you said that it is important to have religious minded wives and a happy marriage and that one man can have more than one wife because it is not for physical pleasure and that the wives should be moral and religious minded. My question would be why would a man need more than one wife for spiritual guidance? Why is it that ancient women don't have many husbands that are moralistic and religious minded. Why would Dashrath have 3 wives and if they were for moral guidance and not merely for physical pleasure how come king Dashrath had son's from all of them. Would you not think that at some point our Vedas are also advocating polygamy? besides all Gods somehow seems to have many wives, Lord Chandra had 21 wives, Rohini being his favorite, Lord Surya had two wives. Somehow this is extremely difficult to digest that if Vedas are held in such high esteem and if GOD is formless and is eternal Brahaman then how come our own GODs display qualities of lust and desire. This is all very confusing especially when Shiva embraces the feminine power as Shakti and considers himseld as Half women. When some of our same religious text refer to women as Shakti and mighty powerful and supreme. Please provide some insight to clarify the doubt.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> The matter of husband of wife is personal and can not be inturrupted by anyother. Wife is only one but other can be kept with their wishes and the wishes of man. One can be a life long brahmchari at his own even man or any lady like Bhisahm or bal brahmcharini gargi. Or any can have more than one wife like king dashrath, king Dhritrashtra, king Pandu, etc., etc. Nobody can interrupt being personal matter. However if somebody having more wives for physical charm only he and the ladies both will have to pay the consequences direct from the God. But king dashrath etc., mentioned by me are not in these category. They were learned of Vedas and were highly religious minded dignitaries on the earth. The people may tell anything against them being their own views due to lack of study of Vedas please. Vedas does not tell whatever you are describing please. On the site I can not give full knowledge of Vedas. As regard Indra, etc., these are puranic stories, which are not according to Vedas, please. Desire is the quality of soul and not God please.

And no any Yogi can create the universe like God. So difference between yogi and God is always there. Nobody can be a God. Manifests does not tell that the body has become the God.

                <b>Anonymous:</b> How to break away from the influence of this world like ego, anger, etc.?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Egoism, anger, etc., are due to lack of knowledge (in Hindi avidya as per yog shastra sutra 2/5). Due to the avidya bad deeds are done. And as per yog shastra sutra 2/13 the deeds are to be faced in the shape of further births etc., which is also clarified in yog shastra sutra 4/7,8. So egoism, anger, proud etc., are due to avidya and with the result effects of bad deeds viz., egoism, anger, proud etc., live in the mind and at proper time starts functioning. Fuel, desire etc., are due to said reason. I am writing detailed comments on Yog shastra in Hindi, which will be completed within month wherein detailed answer of a such questions exist. On demand the shastra can be sent to you, please. But part one of the Yog shastra is available with sutra 2/5,13, which can be sent on receipt of your postal address. The price is Rs. 131.00 excluding postal charges. Everything is created by avidya and then further by doing deeds under impression of avidya. So one should study Vedas, do Yagya and practice ashtang Yoga philosophy to overcome avidya under guidance of a spiritual Guru, who knows Vedas and ashtang Yoga philosophy. Vide Samkhya shastra sutra 1/26 mind is non-alive matter made from prakriti and can not do anything at its own. I am not creation of your mind, you, I and whole universe is creation by prakriti non-alive and power of God (alive). In this case too body is a creation and not souls. If we all are one then we all must sleep together and if one is awaked then everybody must be awaked. And sorrows/happiness of all must be same, but it is not. One should help the others to make them happy and wise. But before doing such pious deeds first of all one should make himself pure and wise by following Vedic path.

So the story in the Purann stated above is not correct. Secondly at the beginning of the earth the knowledge from God of Vedas is originated in the heart of four rishis from whom the other study and becomes rishi. So traditionally is reached to Vyas muni. Vyas muni studied Vedas from his acharya. At that time it was heart to heart and not by books. So first time the knowledge of four Vedas was written by Vyas muni during Mahabhart time i.e., about five thousand three hundred years back. So Vyas muni is not a writer of Vedas. He wrote the Vedas on bhoj patra, which he already studied from his acharya by heart.

This all is mentioned specially in the last tenth mandal sukta 119 of Rigveda. So Shivji Maharaj also did not take bhang.

The said deeds are always burnt by worshipping only one Almighty God. Specially by Yagya and yoga practice. You're advised to please to chant the Gaytri mantra daily with concentration on agya chakr.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Vedas are the knowledge emanates direct from God in the heart of four rishis in the beginning of the earth. Vedas never tells any story or any worldly reference like puran or any names etc. Vedas tell fundamental law of universe about worship deeds, and knowledge i.e., knowledge of all the matters of the universe(science, medical science etc.) as regards punishment God Himself awards punishment according to the good or bad deeds as is clarified in all Vedas like Yajurveda mantra 7/48 because God needs no any assistance of Yamraj etc., being Almighty. He has all powers complete in all respect. So it is false to say that Vedas tells about any puran etc.

Vedas are eternal knowledge emanates direct from God in which there is only one God who is formless, Almighty, omnipresent, omniscient, creates, nurses and destroys the universe etc., etc. So He is only adorable and worshippable and the God gives everything to us but never takes food etc., in return. So one should perform holy yagya in homes according to Vedas. For women they are advised in Vedas to look after the family, i.e., husband, children and elders properly. They should make happy their husbands.

The problems are never finished until one gains Vedic knowledge and do worship by yagya, listening of Vedas and practice of yoga philosophy in family life.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Actually sorrows and happiness are the result of own previous lives' deeds. Deeds are only burnt by worship of God. Then the others who gives problems either will stopped to give problem or the person who worship regularly a true worship he will be able to bear peacefully. New deeds are always faced in next lives. Because present life as per Rigveda mantras 10/135/1 to 4, say that present life has to face the previous deeds and the deeds done in present life will be born in future that is next lives.

But now a days mostly the saints do not study Vedas, do not do holy yagya and do not do practice of ashtang yoga. Hence the problem that they does meaning of sutras against the Vedas but original sutras are not against the Vedas. One must think that the bhagwat Geeta and six shastras have been written as said above and the meaning of such holy granthas or preaches thereon are being delivered by those saints who never studied Vedas, never do yagya, never do practice of ashtang yoga traditionally.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Vedas say know yourself through yourself. In humna body soul resides. We are soul and we are not body. God has given us body and mind to do pious deeds. But mind (mann) always interrupts to follow truth. You're also soul and not body and mind etc., So the fight was or will be future within you (alive soul) and mind. Through mind peace can't be achieved. All holy granths including Vedas preach to control the mind and five senses. Because mind is made of prakriti which has three qualities i.e., raj, tam and satv, which create always bad atmosphere. So please control your mind with firm desire. Your mind has made you to weep. Everybody requires a holy path i.e., a Guru who tells about Vedas and tell the way to practice ashtang yoga philosophy and do yagya, which are the best worship of God. Then only one becomes able to make the mind dead and controls five senses.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Actually ad Guru Shankracharya ji (about 1500 years back) were the philosopher of Vedas. He did shashtrarth (discussion) to several Gurus at that time and condemned them who were against the Vedas. One man deceived Sri Shankracharya ji and showed himself his disciple. The man used to give slow pioson to Shankracharya ji. And at last Shankracharya ji died. Then again the man with others spread their own thoughts telling the people that the thoughts were of Shankrachraya ji. One should never think against Vedas.

                <b>Lovely Sharma:</b> Can pregnant ladies chant the Gayatri Mantra? Is there any harmful effect if I chant Gayatri mantra? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes please she can chant the Gayatri mantra. Vedas are for everybody keeping aside gender, caste, poor or rich etc. Chanting the mantras is for getting peace, wisdom ,co-operation, love to human beings, to overcome the illusion, to serve the elder/parents, etc., etc and finally to realize God while performing moral duties for family, society and nation. So God has given the knowledge of Ved mantras for all because God has no favourism etc., being supreme judge. So it is even sin to say that daughters, boy, ladies or pregnant ladies etc., are not allowed to chant Gayatri mantra, which is in three Vedas.

                <b>Mehnaz:</b> You had said that eating meat is prohibited, but I don't agree with this. Meat is a good source of excellent protein.it also contains iron, vitamin B1 and niacin. 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> When meat is good source of vitamins etc., then why meat is not eaten by elephant who has the greatest strength with all vitamins. Actually in dry fruits, vegetables, there are more vitamins in comparison of meat and meat is harmful to human beings, which has since been clarified by science also.

                <b>Mehnaz:</b> Humans Have Omnivorous Set Of Teeths.. If u observe the teeth of herbivorous animals like goat, cow etc. all these animals have flat teeth because they eat grass. If u observe the teeth of carnivorous animals like lion, tiger etc, they have pointed teeth to eat flesh. But if you analyse the human teeth, you find that they have falt as well as pointed teeth hence they are omnivorous. One may ask, if Almighty God wanted humans to have vegetables, why did he provide us with pointed teeth? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Pointed teeth are for taking apple, guava, etc.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Mehnaz:</b> The digestive system of herbivorous animals can digest only vegetables and carnivorous animals only flesh but the digestive system of humans can digest both veg and non veg. If Almighty God, wanted us to have only veg, then why did he give us a digestive system which can digest both foods? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> No please. Human beings only easily can digest vegetarian food only within three hours, whereas meat is first not allowed but by taking meat it is adjusted in several hours and before its digestion another meat or other foods are taken which creates diseases like cancer etc., which has since been clarified by science also.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Mehnaz:</b> I think Hindu scriptures give permission to non vegetarian food.
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> This is all against the Vedas please. Mostly People are innocent and They do not know the real meaning of Vedic word. secondly in most of our holy books false statements have been added when we were slaves for thousand years. Only a Yogi who has realized God by hard practice of ashtang yoga and hard study of Vedas can tell truth. so your above statement has been written by those who are against the Vedas and have not studied Sanskrit grammar and four Vedas. otherwise such sins can't be uttered for which God gives punishment sure.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Because caste system is not in Vedas for which I have already written a lot, so I think discussion about Aadi Guru Shankracharya is needed not. Yajurveda mantra 31/11 says that he is brahman who knows four Vedas has done practice of yoga philosophy and has realized God. So Shankracharya ji was great brahman having all the said qualities.

                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Vedas tell everything right from straw to Almighty God. Sri Krishna Maharaj also had two wives, King Dashrath had three wives and not four. So it is matter of situation and personal feelings but based on Vedas. However the wives were not meant for getting physical charms etc. Those wives had studied Vedas and were learned of yoga philosophy as well as their husbands. So question at this juncture when mostly the individuals do not know the ancient culture and eternal knowledge of Vedas about brahmcharya and moral duties etc, including finance, is baseless. Daily newspaper and news on TV have been telling that the people who have one wife either are quarrelling daily or wife has left house leaving their children with her friend etc. Or bad contacts of the women and men are also being published in news. And such news comes from mostly all over the world, which give proof that present family life of one man and one wife or more are not successful. Daily problems are there, whereas in the ancient times one husband having more wives etc., had religious minded wife with all qualities with successful life. So requirement is of knowledge of Vedas for husband and wife both is first and then question of marriage, please.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> In Vedas the meaning of pooja is to give honour/respect to Almighty God. Further it is stated that the best method of Pooja (worship) is to perform holy Yagya (Yajyen) with Ved mantras. In this method three types of the mantras are specially recited while offering aahuti in Vedi (havan kund) --- stuti (qualities which are unlimited in respect of God), upasana (worship/devotion) and prarthna (pray). The method is mentioned on this web site which may please be seen. However a book in Hindi to perform holy yagya with Ved mantras has also been written by me and can be sent on receipt of your postal address, if you're desirous of.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Ram Krishna Paramhans was spiritual guru of Sri Vivekanand. So, both were of same path. They accepted Vedanta, i.e., soul is God and except God there is nothing, neither soul nor prakriti/world. Whereas Swami Dayanand were against the said path. The preach of Swami Dayanand was totally based on the eternal knowledge of Vedas, Vedas being emanated direct from God.

I am facing sorrows today because my soul has done bad deeds in the past and now I don’t even know what bad deeds I have done. This concept to me something strange it is understood that if I am doing something wrong I should be punished for it I will face it because I know it’s my mistake. Now I am feeling that if do lot of bad deeds I know that I will get results in next life and in that life i will not remember what I have done. Please clarify in detail.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Nutritious diet makes man healthy but it is not applicable for everybody because somebody has problem to digest etc. So the proper and eternal spiritualism is to be attained please. 
                <br>
                <br>God fearing is something else but to know the qualities of God from Vedas and then having fear of God is something else. For example Yajurveda mantra 40/1 says that God is everywhere. And people listen and even the people listen the said truth from other holy books. But how many bother the fact of preach? I mean to say after listening or worshipping mostly the people do sins. And the way of listening or doing holy yajyen or yoga practice like asan, pranayam, meditation etc. is proper according to Vedas it is a question. So doing yajna and pious deeds like yoga practice etc., are pious but due to lack of proper knowledge from a spiritual acharya, are not sufficient to kill the previous deeds. But the pious gathered by following the said path will sure give happiness one day but will not kill the previous deeds. To kill the deeds one will have to be an ascetic. So everybody must carry on doing yajna etc., always and one day will sure come when he will get knowledge by the grace of God from any Vedic acharya/yogi to kill the previous deeds. The result of deeds of someone else are never faced. Soul never takes birth and is immortal. According to deeds soul gets body, so the same soul has been facing his previous deeds according to the law of God made in Vedas. Not your soul but you're yourself an immortal soul. Actually soul is indulged in materialistic articles and has forgotten his original shape of immortal and remaining ever pleasant etc. Soul requires Vedic guidance from a spiritual master. As regards forgetness of previous deeds it is but natural. Can any person remember in present life that before a month what he ate, what vegetable, what dal, and in which position he was sitting to take food etc.? So when in present life everybody forgets his deeds then what to talk about previous life. Even a person tells lie but he forgets and produces that he is telling truth. Where then the fear of God exists?

                <b>Jay:</b> What, How much and whom should we donate? 
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> First of all a real needy person requires donation. Needy means he has no source of income, has no house, no clothes, no food inspite of his best efforts. So in this category beggars and the richest saints who are against the Vedas do not come. We have to follow the order of Almighty God mentioned in Vedas. So a rishi who knows Vedas has controlled his senses gives knowledge of Vedas to others, does hard practice of ashtang yoga philosophy daily helps the poors, has equal dealing in society keeping aside caste system or poor or rich etc. And inspires the people to do havan daily and gives the knowledge of one Almighty formless God is highly capable to get donation with all respect. This all has been mentioned in all Vedas. Specially Atharvaveda kand 9 refers. In which there are so many mantras on the subject. Also Rigveda mandal 10 sukta 107 containing eleven mantras also refers.

                <b>Swarendra:</b> While doing Japa with Mala, it is said that one should not cross the meru mani. In that case how can one concentrate on the Mantra?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> That is why mostly Sufi sants have told (based on Vedas) that mala is not needed. Actual name jaap is done from breathing system. Vedas do not say about mala. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Krishna Prasad:</b> In Game of messages, first person tells some message to second person, second to third and so on. By the time the message goes to fifteenth person or so, that message is entirely changed. So keeping this in Mind, I am afraid that even our Holy books, rituals etc might have been changed. One Corrupt translator or Guru is enough to pass wrong message which we might be following?
                <br>
                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Yes you're absolutely right please. For example in Vedas there is a preach to perform holy Ashwamegh Yagya. So many translator have told that in such yagya the horse must be slaughtered etc. whereas in that mantra the meaning of Ashwa is nation and not horse. So maximum Ved mantras have been translated quiet wrong. Then what to talk about other holy Granth which have been written in easy language like Hindi, English etc. This is only due to lack of study of real knowledge and practice of yoga philosophy. Most of the saints are talking baselessly only based on bookish knowledge and hence the problem. In Vedas it is clearly mentioned that he who is lack of knowledge makes his own interpretations and not based on Vedas or ancient culture. So Vedas again say that one should only listen from a learned Vedic philosopher and a Yogi and the listener must become learned and then he must start giving preaches to make another personal a learned one. So, little knowledge is always dangerous.

                <b>Swami Ramswarup:</b> Nachiketa was son of Uddalak Rishi. Uddalak rishi once decided to donate all his assetts. Nachiketa saw that his father is donating the oldest cows which are of no use to anybody. And the good cows were being saved. Nachiketa thought that it is a sin in respect of his father. Further he thought that his father loves him and the good cows are being saved for him (Nachiketa). He wanted to escape his father from such sin. So Nachiketa decided that if his father will donate him (Nachiketa) also then all will be okay and his father will not save the cows. So he went to his father and requested him to donate him (Nachiketa) also because his father had pledged that he (Uddalak Rishi) will donate all assets. Nachiketa requested his father that he is also his asset. So he must donate his son also. The rishi due to affection kept silence. But when repeatedly Nachiketa requested his father to donate him then rishi in anger told nachiketa, "I donate you to death." Story is long and I can't brief here. Nachiketa then decided to obey his father and went to Yamraj. Yamraj was not there. He waited for three days when Yamraj came back. Yamraj told Nachiketa to obtain three blessings etc, etc, etc. (you can send postal address for detailed story). So, in Vedas there is no any Yamraj etc. Yam means the deity of death. Almighty God is Himself is Yam.

For example Tulsi says Sri Ram was avatar which is against Vedas, but in another chopai he says God is formless then it is okay. So even the false books are there but they also have little bit truth based on Vedas which must be observed. However, fundamental law says that in any book if false statements against Vedas and science are there the whole book must be ignored.
