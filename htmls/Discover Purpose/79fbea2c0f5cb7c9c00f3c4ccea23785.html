It is amazing how the words of others can really rock your world by resonating with your heart. &nbsp;We all have a favorite, so last week we asked –</p> 
       <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>What single quote is your all-time favorite, AND what makes it so powerful and meaningful for you?</strong></p> 
       <p style="text-align:left;">It was so exciting to see all the amazing quotes come pouring in. So many were new, mixed in with long-time favorites. I think the biggest gift to come out of this post is <span id="more-2882"></span>in the stories of why each quote is meaningful to the person who shared it. You will see in the comments below how words can really light someone up from the inside out, challenging them, inspiring them, motivating them to make a difference.</p> 
       <p><em>&nbsp;<strong>Our sincere gratitude to the 89 entrepreneurs who were kind enough to post their stories.</strong></em>&nbsp;Openly sharing your expertise and experiences is a huge asset to this blog and the readership. I wish you all a wonderful week and hope to see you here again.

          <td valign="top"> <h3>1. The Things That Count The Most</h3> <p>I don’t know who said, “Those who do things that count never stop to count them,” but it has always been my favorite quote.</p> <p>I not only like to stay busy and active, but I like the way I feel when I am productive and giving to others through my actions. It isn’t about being able to put volunteer service items on your resume, it’s about that feeling you have given someone else in need. That moment is priceless.</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Jen Watkins of <a href="http://www.stgnews.com/">St. George News</a></p> </td>

          <td valign="top"> <h3>2. My Favorite Inspiring Quote</h3> <p>“Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.” – Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</p> <p>I still remember the first time I heard this quote. I was in high school and it really spoke to me. It is a great quote that said to me “What are you waiting for? Just go for it.” Sometimes you don’t always know all the steps or how you will get something done, but don’t let that stop you — do it anyway. It reminds me that fear of failure can stop you if you let it, but taking action is a wonderful thing, and things start falling into place when you start moving toward your goal.</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Scarlet Paolicchi of <a href="http://momswearyourtees.com">Moms Wear Your Tees Social Media Marketing </a></p> </td>

Everybody who is a winner, a success, is there because at some point they dared to be different, dared to take a chance, dared to believe in something nobody else did.</p> <p>This means so much that I have even tattooed the phrase on my arm.</p> <p>Dare to Win!</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Michael Brandvold of <a href="http://michaelbrandvold.com">Michael Brandvold Marketing</a></p> </td>

Not all choices are easy. Not all decisions are going to be accepted by everyone. I have had people question the path I have chosen many times, from my choice of college to my choice of careers. But being true to yourself is not about being easy it is about being happy. If I wanted acceptance, I would do what people expected me to do, and if I did that I would not be where I am today. In love with my husband, a degree from Smith College, an MBA, a career I love, a business that I am making thrive, friends that know the real me, a family that knows and loves the real me.

Marsalis said: “Humans are imperfect. That’s one of the reasons that classical and jazz are in trouble. We’re on the quest for the perfect performance and every note has to be right. Man, every note is not right in life.”</p> <p>As a leadership development consultant, this quote reminds me that human relations are messy, unpredictable, often bewildering things. Consequently, we need to recognize that achieving perfection in our interactions with others is not possible. We will make mistakes. We will disappoint. We will come up short. Rather, we should strive for excellence in everything we do. We should also seek to learn from our shortcomings so that we can get just a little bit better every day.</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Michael Brenner of <a href="http://ideagency.net/building-trust.html">IdeAgency</a></p> </td>

Do you need practice in budgets, making speeches or doing cold-call sales? Look around you. Who do you see that is excellent at these skills? Don’t be afraid to simply ask for their help. Most people are happy to share their tips and techniques with you.</p> <p>We often create our own obstacles, by fearing to cross the threshold of an important person’s office, when in fact all we need to do is face our fear, enter the office, and say, “Would you mind helping me?

Anything Worth Doing Is Worth Doing Well</h3> <p>“Never, ever, ever, ever give up even when, and especially when, there is no chance of winning” – Ann Curry’s take on the Japanese concept of Gamburu, the art and spirit of the effort.</p> <p>This quote is my all-time favorite because it crystallizes the concept that anything worth doing is worth doing well. A successful outcome in any endeavor often depends on outside factors out of our control. Our best efforts can be wiped away because we don’t control luck. In contrast, we can control how much effort we make. Despite our efforts in some of our most hard-fought battles, success is not assured, especially when improbable. But we could also end up winning despite the odds. In all facets of life, however, putting in a lackluster effort is a recipe for failure — better not undertaken to begin with.</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Ian Aronovich of <a href="http://governmentauctions.org">GovernmentAuctions.org</a></p> </td>

Jacks (Lawrence Pearsall Jacks, 1860-1955)</p> <p>The quote tells us that not only can we achieve excellence while enjoying the journey, but the sheer enjoyment of it all is a prerequisite for excellence.

I need to be calm and collected and figure out their problems as best as possible, “like a duck.”</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Sheel Mohnot of <a href="http://feefighters.com">FeeFighters Credit Card Processing</a></p> </td>

Whether he’s got an abscess on his knee or in his soul.” -Rona Barrett</p> <p>Most of us think that asking for help makes us weak. Yet, the successful Rona Barrett points out that to be healthy and strong you ask for help when you need it. It’s wiser to recognize when you need help and then ask for it, than to waste time, energy and resources trying to prove you can do it all by yourself. By personally shedding the concept that I can (and should) figure everything out alone, I have opened my personal and professional world to higher quality outcomes with less effort. With this, I can concentrate on what’s most important to me (e.g., helping my clients through coaching rather than toiling with my taxes solo).</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Angela Martin of <a href="http://definingsuccesscoaching.com">Defining Success Coaching</a></p> </td>

(Some guys golf, I would rather race) Mario Andretti’s quote speaks to both these areas of my life. It’s always been true, that I work more effectively when things seem a little crazy.

I don’t think it is really just about justifying the disarray on your desk… but more about the fact that creative thinking and innovation happens only if you don’t just focus on the one specific problem you want to solve, but let the world in. Allow thoughts, approaches, tools, solutions and people, in short: “the clutter” in, who have little to do with the subject matter and see what they have to say. Let it rest for a while.

Let the noon find you by other lakes, and the night overtake thee everywhere at home. There are no larger fields than these, no worthier games than may here be played.”</p> <p>It’s powerful because of its romantic subject matter and because of the impactful way in which it’s delivered. Waking each morning before dawn and seeking adventure calls to mind the thought of a life well-lived; that is, a life that is not wasted, that is filled with fresh experiences. The subject matter, then, is powerful — it implores you to live a meaningful life. Thoreau delivers this message in an imperative, cogently telling us to “Rise free.” If he were to have said, “You should rise free” it would not have been so vigorous.</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Chilton Tippin of <a href="http://accuconference.com/">AccuConference</a></p> </td>

Living in the 21st century, society values the opinions of experts, doctors, therapists, and consultants. Due to the title, we seek their advice, consider it and in most situations act on them.

Yeah, that Jesus.</p> <p>What makes it meaningful is that it gets me off the ego merry-go-round. It forces a recognition that we are all connected, and if I don’t do for you it will ultimately come at a cost to me. On the up side, for the same reason doing for you invariably comes back to me. In my younger years I gave this saying only a fleeting chance and decided it didn’t work. But after getting repeatedly punished in life for living otherwise, I decided to give it another go. Lo and behold, “this time” it worked. The truth is my lip service to it wasn’t genuine the first time around. It turns out intention really matters.

Too often we complain that things aren’t fair, or people are rude, or life is cruel. We don’t realize that we can begin changing by changing ourselves. You want to see more love in this world? Offer more. You want to see more gratitude? Be gracious. It all starts with us.</p> <p>We can change this world one day at a time, by changing ourselves first.</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Wendy Alton of <a href="http://altonlaw.blogspot.com">Fausone Bohn, LLP</a></p> </td>

I Owe My Success To This Oprah Winfrey Quote</h3> <p>“You become what you believe.” – Oprah Winfrey</p> <p>By day I’m the senior health producer at <a href="http://www.Foxnews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Foxnews.com</a>, and by night I run a blog <a href="http://www.listproducer.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.listproducer.com</a> — it’s all about making lists to be more organized. This Oprah quote speaks to me because it’s all about the power of attraction and how what you put into something is what you get out of it. I’m a firm believer in that. All the accomplishments that I’ve had in my life — both at home and at work — have been because I’ve believed that it could be done. This works for big and small tasks alike — getting a seat on a subway or getting a job promotion! It’s all the same — as long as you truly believe it.</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Paula Rizzo of <a href="http://listproducer.com">Listproducer.com</a></p> </td>

When I Grow Up, I Don’t Want To Grow Up.</h3> <p>As a young boy, I watched my grandparents (whom I didn’t realize were only in their 50s) act like old, tired people. Added to that was my father, who has acted and talked like he was old my whole life. I realized that I did not want to be that way.</p> <p>So my favorite quote is, “When I grow up, I don’t want to grow up.”</p> <p>I honestly don’t know if I read this quote or made it up myself, it has been with me for so long. All I know is that I wanted to keep that inner child alive and strong. I wanted to find myself laughing and making other people laugh. I turn 60 tomorrow (May 18) and my wife says I’m doing a great job and have accomplished my goal!!</p> <p>Now excuse me while I go out and play in the mud.</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Randy Morrow of <a href="http://arlingtonrealestateguide.com">Keller Williams Realty</a></p> </td>

This is what true happiness, joy, contentment and life is all about – finding out what you love &amp; what makes your heart sing and then finding a way to do it. She doesn’t say to make a lot of money (although I think it’s great if that happens) or anything like that – it’s simply to do the thing you were called to do.</p> <p>So powerful because what we all want it to live our best life and to do what we were meant to do.

In our modern dog-eat-dog, analytical, “black &amp; white” world, we forget that at our peril. On all sides are factions who each claim they know best. My political system, my race, my religion, my “ideology of any kind” is THE “right” one. And yet it’s only when we admit we DON’T know, that we find real truth &amp; meaning in life.

When trying to accomplish a goal we have to go that extra mile. You first need to do what you should do, then do what you can do, and then do more.

It reminds me that a lie to self is the worst kind because I can never truly evolve past where I am unless I allow truth to be present.

In this seminar, she made sure we understood that we are more powerful than we know or understand, and that the only way we can use that power is to take full responsibility for our life. The moment I remember most is that when any of us would start whining or making excuses or blaming others about something, she would reply to us in her fabulously direct and powerful way “Well, YOU created it.” — Which meant since we created whatever we were complaining about in our lives by our choices and attitudes, that we were also the only ones ultimately capable of fixing the problem.

Ever since then, I have repeated this quote and used it as my mantra when life gets really rough. In 2009 I started going through a QuarterLife Crisis and used this line as the inspiration for my blog ThinkingMiss. I am the girl who thinks about life way to much, when in reality I need to just let life play its course. My blog is something that I’ve use to chronicle my life from 2007 until now, through a move from Buffalo NY to Washington DC and then to my current home in Austin TX. I have had a few jobs, a few boyfriends, but always the same amazing family to support me. This quote is so meaningful to me because of that boy, who was the love of my life at 16, since he taught me more than anyone I have ever known.

Managers do things right, Leaders do the right thing!” – McKinnon, D.</p> <p>“I’d rather be a ‘could be’ if I cannot be an ‘are’ because a ‘could be’ is a ‘maybe’ who is reaching for a star. I’d rather be a ‘has been’ than a ‘might have been’ by far; For a ‘might have been’ has never been , but a has been was once an ‘are.'” – Milton Berle</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Rusty Smallwood, Planned Giving Officer</p> </td>

          <td valign="top"> <h3>81. Going After Your Dreams</h3> <p>My favorite quote is from James Redfield, author of The Celestine Prophecy. His quote is, “Life is really about unfolding that is personal and enchanting – an unfolding that no science or philosophy or religion has yet fully clarified.”</p> <p>What makes his message powerful for me is he had a dream and went for it. I am author an author of a book called ” The lobster and the chicken” and the journey we are all traveling on through life. He traveled around the country selling books from the trunk of his car and doing radio interviews until he made it. That never give up belief inspires me and lights me up. It’s a long journey to win big in life, looks like I am on my way next month with telling my lobster story on CNN.</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Herb Palmer Jr of <a href="http://lobsterandchicken.com">Lobster And The Chicken</a></p> </td>

          <td valign="top"> <h3>84. It’s Okay To Be Different</h3> <p>“Well behaved women rarely make history.” – Laurel Thatcher Ulrich</p> <p>I have always loved this quote. I first saw it inscribed inside of a friend’s ring. I found it not long after graduating from college and beginning my career, and it resonated with me and continues to remind me to push myself to do the things that aren’t always popular, are a little different, a little crazy, and maybe even a little ridiculous. My experience so far is that this unpopular “behavior” for a professional woman is that it works. I’m successful by my terms. I think women still have to have a bit of an edge to get by, and this is a good reminder that the ones who had the sharpest edge are the ones whose names we repeat.</p> <p class="attribute">Thanks to Brandi Koskie of <a href="http://dietsinreview.com">Media Refined, Inc.</a></p> </td>

         </div> <p>My name is Samar, I’m a 50 year old woman, married for 30+ years with 5 children ranging in ages 32 – 22 years old. Though I’m married with children, great family, house, health and so on. My problem is I have so many regrets from my past about having a great career and other things I wish I had done differently. It’s to a point where I have anxiety, depression saddness. What can I do to let the past go, and look forward to the future, finding a career in teaching at my age, is that dream of leaving the past behind and have a teaching career? Help Samar Hattar</p>

           </div> <p>Samar, I believe that we always have an opportunity to make the most of where life has taken us at any time. It’s all a matter of perspective. Your life hasn’t been wasted tending to your family in lieu of a career. Neither is it too late to embark on a new path in life. You simply have to decide what it is you would like to be at this stage in your life, and then start taking steps in that direction to make it a reality. You have much living ahead, and I suspect that you have many things to offer as a teacher, having been one to your children for the past 32 years. Buying into your sadness will only keep you stuck right where you are in regret. Look at your past experiences as precious treasures that have helped made you into the amazing woman you are today. Then take those precious treasures and turn them into your future.</p> </li>

         </div> <p>My two favourite quotes right now is one that I got from a book called “Eat That Frog!” by Brian Tracy which is about fighting procrastination. It relates beating procrastination with eating a frog. The quotes are:</p> <p>1) The first rule of frog eating is this: If you have to eat two frogs, eat the ugliest one first.</p> <p>2) The second rule of frog eating is this: If you have to eat a live frog at all, it doesn’t pay to sit and look at it for very long.</p> <p>Every time you’re procrastinating a task, think of it as a frog and just Eat That Frog!</p>
