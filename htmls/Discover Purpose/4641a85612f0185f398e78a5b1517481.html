            <p>i have been single parenting for the last 8 months or so.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>yes, it’s true. <a target="_blank" href="http://jennettenielsen.com/smashingrubbish/2015/9/4/blood-sweat-and-tears-a-return-to-love">we tried recommitment </a>but it didn't hold, didn't take, and less than 6 months later i began composting it, letting it transform, giving it back to the earth, ending the contract, letting it go… and it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge what has held me captive: me, bravely, its me.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>let me tell you friends, untangling a 22 year relationship to the father of my children, is tough shit, no easy task, and is requiring my continued commitment to a “kill ‘em with kindness/compassion” warrior stance, a healthy dose of cavernous self-love and patience with my children's varying levels of acceptance, denial and grief, and a side of riotous humor and fat salty tears to get me through the days and seasons.</p>
            <p>and my spiritual practices of course: awakening - to myself and Mystery, making, silence, witchcraft, solitude, movement, singing, altar building, my hands in the earth…these all save me, lift me, cradle and enlighten me. and then there’s my sisters, the dearies who know the details, they really save my life, with their honest reflections, their seeing all of me and staying, their abiding love, their lifetime grace cards, their small sent gifts - every. single. day.</p>
            <p>there were years of vacillating. years and years. so much already lived grief, already lived disconnection. years of pain, mine and his. years of bitterness cloaked in a thin veil of resentment. years of hate, toward myself, and so, toward him too. years of poisonous shame and secrets, his and mine too. years of not knowing what i needed and not asking for what i wanted but knowing it didn't feel good, the life we tried to cobble together, it often didn't feel good, for either of us, and then sometimes it did.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>there was a kind of love. and commitment, lots and lots of commitment. saving my marriage at all costs had previously been paramount to my sense of self-worth. i felt smug for “making it” each new year because we had a dream one day, long ago, that we would make it to old age together and be (unreasonably) happy, in our rockers, on the porch, holding hands.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>but really, we were both martyrs. and that’s no way to live. its not a living.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>the years of not honoring myself, not honoring him, not honoring that we both deserve to have lives lived well, have come to a close. i insist on burning down the established overripe and toxic dynamic so we can each rise again from the ashes, separate, but wholly and holy.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>so here i am, swimming into the deep abyss of marriage dissolution after a 22 year partnership and although it brings its requisite storm of grief and loss, it is also granting me safe passage back to my wildish beloved self. i am learning to live with myself while i find a new way.</p>
            <p>i am prioritizing serenity and freedom. my intentions are set on expansiveness and possibility. i am welcoming the swamp lands of my soul, my shadows, my balsamic dark moon heart. i am encircled by my placental ancestors and i do not walk alone. i can do this. i am doing this.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>a dear sister witch said to me: shame is an indulgent practice. to not work your ass off to heal it means you are still getting some mileage out of it. you haven’t come into this world to wrangle with someone else's idea of you. who is anyone else to tell you who you are? karma and Spirit business is private business, not for anyone else to have anything to do with. do you. be you. and heal, heal, heal.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>so i’m going to be doing that - healing, healing, healing, and sourcing my mellow magic. my life is my quest and i am a seeker. i am a healer and i am healing. it’s true. i am.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>as this 22 year chapter comes to a close i will emerge from this season an alchemized, radiant, re-membered witch, with my integrity intact and authentically me, heavily budding with autonomy and freedom: allowed and allowing. divorced!</p>
            <p>so i welcome you to celebrate and honor me by seeing me “doin’ my thang” and resisting any urge you might have to pity me or express sorrow and sorry-ness. this is all a beautiful gift of growth and grief and its perfectly imperfect and just right. thank you your witnessing my reclamation of sovereignty and composure of agency, sisters. blessed be, each and every one of you, for whom i’ve cavernous gratitude and a vast respect for.&nbsp; thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p class="text-align-center">&nbsp;</p>
            <p>*our spirit story = it’s a both/and world, sisters*&nbsp;</p>
            <p>within the auric field of a sun drenched clearing lined with 13 monolithic river stones, deep within a dark luscious evergreen rainforest portal of the pacific northwest, dripping with velvet moss and enveloped in mist, lived two venerable earth witches, one with yarrow in her braids and her loyal dog by her side, the other with mugwort in her dreads and her adoring cat beneath her bare feet. these were wise women they say, who had embraced many long illustrious decades as ethereal yet grounded sentient beings full of love and forgiveness.</p>
            <p>side by side in their hand hewed, cedar shingled, tin roof cottages, with a massively overflowing medicine garden of shimmering orchards, high vibration food grown from last years heirloom seeds, hundreds of healing herbs and explosions of vibrant fragrant flowers between them, these two cackly elders were blissfully living out the rest of their days in active peace and conscious inter-dependence with each other, the pulsating land, the ancient stone people, the flourishing and tenacious plant nations and the highly attuned wild animals surrounding them ever so benevolently. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>as they milked their goats for cheese and soap making, fermented their veggies in great stoneware crocks for kimchee and kraut, tended their sweet honeybee filled apiary, collected pastel-hued chicken eggs among the ferns, brain tanned bow hunted hides, wove baskets from wild foraged flora, fauna and gnarly roots, mended their skirts and overalls, painted their totemic visions, collected pottery clay creekside, mixed batch after bowl of botanical teas and talismans, and roamed the hills and hollows to refill their apothecary, they reminisced about all the good ol’ high times they’d had in the past, cultivating creative collaboration, with a mischievous twinkle in their sparkly wrinkle surrounded eyes.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>they giggle-snorted and guffawed heartily recalling that the collaborative culture and reciprocal trust of their creative collusions of long ago began with a mutual understanding, respect and awe for one another’s innate and refined gifts, each desiring to bestow both the diversity and the continuity of their distinct skills in intentionally evocative and untamed myth-streams, song-lines and cosmic dream-time fables and folklores, all honed within the framework of raising families and doing their esoteric soul work, while recognizing full well that the vibration of their individual hand-making was as well a collaboration between Goddess/Spirit/Great Mystery and themselves. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>they recollected in hushed whispers of awe, the pooling of their collective perceptions,the bridge of commitment and the expanse of vision that aligned them many moons previous in brewing their veiled-in-secrecy but oh-so-delicious #twowitchescrafting seasonal offerings: to provide rich witchy nourishment, maverick heart thumping beauty, rampant pleasurable restoration, copious unfettered joy, and lavish hand picked inspiration, all conjured through the potential of a wild, strange, mysterious, transformative alchemy that only they and Spirit could summon, spark and dispense each burgeoning season.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>they never forgot their tender muse-inspired beginnings, where they grew from, who supported, buoyed and kept them spiritually tethered, how they were generously held, and the beauty of the ebb and flow. they always remembered. and so the story goes….</p>

            <p>*<strong>my courage is roaring like the sound of the sun</strong>* - N. Case</p>
            <p>he picked me up at sea-tac friday night after i had been living the appalachian dream in the blue ridge mountains of north carolina for a week with my precious jenny.&nbsp; it was finally raining in seattle after the long dry heat summer had delivered so far. petrichor was emanating from the concrete of all things. it smelled like my beloved PNW and i knew i was home. traffic was jammed so when i saw him coming, his big red beard signaling i had the right truck picked out of the dark wet mishmash, i heaved my case into the backseat myself and jumped in the front with a huge grin.&nbsp; between us sat a small cooler with my choice of cider, mineral water or kombucha.&nbsp; it also contained sliced cheese, salami and pickles, washed and sliced strawberries and raspberries, and a bar of my favorite almond and sea salt dark chocolate.&nbsp; This man, i tell ya. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>we crawled our way out of the airport toward home, a 45 minute drive at least.&nbsp; we had that careful way of talking, not rushing to talk over one another like sometimes happens, but a slower, deliberate cadence with punctuated pauses and spots of silence.&nbsp; we spoke of our excitement to pick phatBiscuit up the next day from his week away at camp on Orcas Island and discussed what Gus was up to. he asked if i would tell him where i was taking us the following weekend, a top secret trip he’d agreed to me planning without him knowing details, and i said no, it’s still a surprise. i offered him a pickle and he said, no i just ate mints.&nbsp; i said oh, because you want to kiss me.&nbsp; he said, yes i do. so we did. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>i’d spent the entire five hour flight writing a letter to our soul family, our constellation of sisters and brothers, the ones who give us lifetime grace cards and always have our backs, the ones who know what’s been going on for the last six months+ between he and i.&nbsp; the letter ended up being well over 4000 words long, a condensed retelling of our histories and closing with a request for what was coming next, concerning my secret getaway plans.&nbsp; i told him i needed him to read it when we got home, scanning for inconsistencies or half accuracies, wanting it to be sincerely authentic and bold with truth. the next day he would be in a knife making class all day and i required the proofreading to happen that night, so i could send it immediately, time being of the essence.&nbsp; he declared his willingness to read it while i took a shower and began unpacking.&nbsp; i was anxious to see his response to the letter, whether he would thumb it up or put the kibosh on it.&nbsp; i was curious.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>i arrived home to the kitchen table being covered in a botanical mandala of fern, cedar, dahlias, lilies, sun flowers, zinnias, and antlers.&nbsp; this has become one of his love languages over the last six months and i cherish it without being too expectant.&nbsp; i've come home to them built on and around my bed, on an altar table in my bedroom, on the kitchen counter. his creativity in constructing these ancient ephemeral reunification symbols, colluding with Spirit and desire to create a sacred visual narrative offering on my behalf, speaks like a holy prayer to me.&nbsp; his creativity is flowing out of him like an electric currant these days, high voltage and amplified.&nbsp; it’s a major turn on. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>as he starts to read the letter on my computer i open my suitcase and haul out the stack of vinyl i brought back from Appalachia.&nbsp; i find the Wilson Pickett album and set up the turntable. the nostalgic crackle and pop of needle to record pricks up my ears. i unload the suitcase into piles while he engages the letter, then i crack a can of hard cider as i move toward the shower. i notice he scrubbed the toilet and emptied the trashcan which probably means he also changed the sheets, another of his usual welcome home gifts, appreciated and adored. the steamy shower feels good and the sudsy rose soap smells familiar, my body relaxing and yearning for my ordinary bed and crisp clean linens. i finish lathering scented oils all over me and return to the dim lit kitchen, incense smoky and fragrant, where i find him with tears in his eyes, a familiar sight. he likes my writing, he tells me every time, you're a magical wordsmith, and i try to believe him.&nbsp; this time he's moved by the story i told, the one about us, the bare bones of so many details yet untouched, the one that not many know, the one i’m going to risk sharing now.&nbsp; he says, you, me, my dad, our boys, our community of friends, us.&nbsp; it’s been years of blood, sweat and tears.&nbsp; and now its a return to love. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
            <p>the letter:</p>
            <p>hello beautiful soul family, our constellation of sisters and brothers</p>
            <p>as you likely know by now, chad and i are taking a trip over labor day weekend to renew our marriage vows to one another, to recommit to our 21 year relationship in the hopes we can manifest another 20+ years of deepening our love for one another. it's a rebirth wherein we are calling in deeper relationship with profound trust and intimacy supported by Spirit. and we need your help too, your support. we couldn't continue this journey without it. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>i want to tell you a little about where we’ve come from, what we've gone through and where we are now. i will speak plainly.</p>
            <p>our relationship has been tumultuous and passionate. it’s not been easy for us, from the beginning, but we have remained determined to go to the ends of the earth in search of healing, commitment, growth and transformation. within 6 weeks of meeting each other in 1994, i was pregnant. I had already been married and divorced by age 21 so finding myself pregnant a few months later, having miraculously never been pregnant before, i took it as a sign to find direction in my life and become a mom. i told chad he was welcome to stay or go but that staying meant he might as well figure he was married. he tearfully announced he was all in and from then on our coupled soul work path was being tread and well worn. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>as a young woman who had suffered many years of childhood sexual abuse and not having fully dealt with it, i was in for a rough rode to recovering myself. to my moms credit, when i told her at age 11 what had been happening for the last seven years, she made sure my three younger siblings and i never had to see her second husband again.&nbsp; what she wasn’t able to do was get me any kind of help, whatsoever, no counseling, support or therapy.&nbsp; she was certain my bio dad would take me away from her if he knew what had happened, so she carefully swept the entire incident under the rug and sealed her lips shut, ensuring i did the same. along with the abuse and confusion, it really fucked me up to keep it secret and have no one to help me make sense of it.&nbsp; i became promiscuous, angry, reckless and suicidal, swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills at 16 when my 21 year old boyfriend broke up with me (yeah, 21 and 16. ew.). when i awoke from being in the hospital, having my stomach pumped and a psych evaluation, there was my bio dad soothing my hair back, sitting at my bedside, none the wiser as to why his daughter was so fucked up, and i couldn't tell him. from early on the pressure and fear manifested as ultra perfectionism and i was a straight A student hoping to go off to college but the guy i met after the other “adult” boyfriend left became my high school sweetheart and i moved in with him the same weekend i graduated high school, happy to be out from under my moms roof. my parents never spoke to me about the possibility of college but i slowly took classes at community college and worked, marrying the guy at age 19, crying the whole time, and not from happiness. a year later i divorced him, after being unfaithful, and within months i (re)met chad (we’d know of each other in high school) and got pregnant with August. having a baby brought up all the old childhood wounds and it wasn't until i was going to night school when he was a year old that i started seeing a counselor there and began diving into all the childhood stuff.&nbsp; the counselor there told me that it wasn't my job to be the secret keeper in my family and that if my mom choose to be, that was her path, not mine.&nbsp; it was revolutionary, shocking and began the unraveling of so many pent up emotions, feelings, thoughts and patterns. i am not sure how chad and i survived those first couple years because we were in couples therapy together from the get go, but i wasn't willing to go beyond admitting what had happened to me, with him and/or the therapist, for fear of everything imploding. i attributed our staying together to sheer survival and co-dependence.&nbsp; somehow we managed.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>for chad, being raised by an abusive drug dealing outlaw biker and being the older brother of three little sisters, he had his work cut out for him too. his mom was an alcoholic and not only were his parents extremely physically and emotionally abusive to him but his uncles were too. like me, he wasn't well cared for or looked after and it had its consequences. he grew up with weed, meth and weapons around as a very normal part of life. his dad spent nights in jail and when he became the “sergeant-at-arms” of the outlaw motorcycle club he was part of, was being sent to Australia to represent them. when he was home he was training chad to fight for his life. chad was told to always hit first and that if he ever came home beat up, his dad would beat him next.&nbsp; he was told to never back down and never look away, which also made fighting his dad an exercise in survival. his dad beat him so bad one christmas morning for saying a swear word into his new microphone recorder that he’s hated christmas ever since. he has pissed his pants in fear, being held up against the wall, his fathers hands around his neck. he’s been knocked out from getting head-butted by his dad, whose biker nickname was “head-butt bob.” he watched his dad beat a guy bloody in the grocery store for staring and pointing at chad’s mohawk. he watched him beat another guy bloody at a gas station for looking at him sideways. his dad picked him up from work one night and took him for a ride-along down a dark alley with a pistol in his lap, looking for a guy he was going to shoot. the weekend before we moved in together, 5 weeks after meeting, bob, in a rage, threw a hammer at chad’s head, barely missing. this gives you a general idea of the chaos and just barely touches it. trauma, trauma, and more trauma, for all the formative years of his life.&nbsp; what a disaster.</p>
            <p>so when we met we just did the best we could.&nbsp; i was 21, he was 20, we were total hippies and poor. chad had made some bad choices in his later teens (go figure!) and was just trying to get his feet underneath him. between us it was all sex and raging libido, dreadlocks and stellar weed, reggae and dancing, bare feet and grateful dead, carefree and in the moment.&nbsp; it was not any talk of the future, planning, being careful, or thinking beyond the end of each weeks paycheck. nine months after meeting chad we had baby august and we did the best we could with what we knew.&nbsp; luckily i had some outside influences coaching me toward success in parenting and we choose attachment parenting as a way of life, bucking the script we’d inherited. we were determined to do it different, do it better, and to not let our son be sacrificed to the multi-generational patterning we were handed.&nbsp; it was time to break the cycle and many times in our attempts it almost broke us. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>when august was a baby, chad and his dad miraculously reconciled (i know!) and due to a major injury, bob was no longer running hard with the outlaws. initiated as part of a violent brotherhood he was caught in that web until the end but he was softer, kinder, gentler, regretful and sorrowful. chad accepted his dads attempts to redeem himself, forgiving all his trespasses, and i followed suit. bob played the guitar and read tarot. he carved runic symbols on his staff and topped it with crystals and feathers. he told me i was a goddess while i was in labor with gus.&nbsp; he helped send us to paris for my 27th birthday, january 1, 2000. and every time chad and i fought he would tell chad to get his ass back home and not lose the best thing that would ever happen to him. he watched out for us and rooted for us. i loved him for that. he was our token weirdo extra-ordinary non-status-quo grandpa for gus and we counted on him as such. and he doted on gus like he was the best thing in all the land, under all the cosmos.&nbsp; and then we lost him suddenly and chad began to unravel, losing himself to grief and alcohol. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>bob died when august was almost five, a month after we’d returned from paris. before that, during august’s pre-school years, i managed to get my college degree and we bought our first house. by this time i was coming out of the closet as a survivor and had even told my dad, not giving two shits what everyone knowing would do to/for my mom. chad was a union plumber and we were managing, still going to therapy on and off, trying to learn the ropes of responsible adulthood.&nbsp; we were super responsible, and yet still we were twenty-something hippies. so we occasionally did psychedelics, smoked a lot of pot, which was chad’s drug of choice, and would drink once in awhile.&nbsp; but when chad unexpectedly lost his dad to a massive heart attack at 44, from a life of hard drugging, chad’s drinking slowly and sneakily spiraled out of control. the rock bottom a year and a half later was gus and i fleeing to my moms, of all places, that’s how desperate i was, seeking refuge. we no longer had Bob around to talk sense into chad, sending him home to straighten up and get sober, reminding him of what was on the line, what he stood to lose. i gave chad an ultimatum, rehab or divorce and without missing a beat he came to his senses and went to inpatient rehab.&nbsp; our life was about to change drastically again.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>living with the clean and sober chad brought our unconscious co-dependence into the light of day and boy did we struggle to find our way.&nbsp; i was grateful even though we were so raw. being sober after numbing out for so long opens all kinds of cans of worms! we found a therapist we would continue to work with for years.&nbsp; on our first visit she said, what do you want? our answer was that we wanted to still be sitting on our front porch in rocking chairs, holding hands, in our seventies. damn if she didn't hold us to it every single time we went to see her over the years, every time i said i want a divorce, every time he said i cant take it anymore, and somehow we hung on. she did what she could to help us, she was a soothsayer of sorts, and out of comfort we stayed with her for too long in hindsight. now we wish and see that we should/could have been doing much deeper soul work all those years but for whatever reason, if we choose to believe in right timing, it wasn't time yet. we limped along, our broken childhood selves still needing so much care and mending. i would resent, blame and despise him. he would project, yell and shut down. we were a mess and yet still we would often find our way back to one another, time and time again. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>enter phatBiscuit. baby biscuit came along unexpectedly when gus was eight years old and chad and i turned toward one another in sheer surprise/terror. we had jasper at home a year into my three year herbal apprenticeship and we began again raising a baby. pB was feisty, demanding and not chillax whatsoever which made blissful partnership no easy feat. at this point chad was still an exhausted residential plumber, working long hours doing lots of side jobs so our ends would meet each month. we managed to hang out with others on a healing path and gleaned all we could to increase our happiness, adjust to two kids, heal our wounds and love one another. it was still rough. we were still rough. chad has always been a big softie and very loving but lacking glaringly in communication skills and appropriate modeling, as was i. so we would fight hard and play/makeup hard.&nbsp; it was tumultuous one day and peaceful the next.&nbsp; we became used to it and got married, as one does. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>i tell you all this to give you some insight into our past since you may not have known us through our entire journey to this point. it’s important to me that you have a sense of our struggles, of our triumphs, of our commitment to keep at it and win. you might be able to imagine the challenges of shirking off the wounds from our dang blasted childhoods! the wounds ran so deep and were so ingrained we’ve had to revisit the spiral of healing over and over and over again. yet we always knew that when we could act from our preferred selves, we would shine but it still was few and far between that we were conscious enough to bring our preferred selves to the boxing ring.&nbsp; we kept trying.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>when jasper turned three and stopped nursing, my/our world opened up a bit.&nbsp; i found blogging, other creatives and wounded healers, and took a much deeper dive into my own personal healing. the kids got bigger and were soon at an age where chad and i could go see live music often and hire babysitters. this helped us, a little, as did chad becoming a union foreman, easing our financial constraints. so, we love to dance together and music is a huge connector for us. i think this period of our lives came right in the nick of time before we cut ties and called it the best we could do. we still struggled mightily to communicate without going straight to attack mode, the old patterns dying ever so hard but we had enough experiences of 2 steps forward and one step back that we kept at it. but don’t get me wrong, we were often an utter train wreck and doubted we’d ever be bound for glory.&nbsp; i will spare you all the gory details but we were becoming pros at annihilating each other, me a wicked name caller and he a classic stonewaller. we would fight and make up, then do it again, then do it some more. it was rarely peaceful for long. but i had my dad telling me how much he regretted letting my mom go all those years ago, wishing he had tried harder, gave more, and he encouraged me to not give up, to keep trying, to keep seeking.&nbsp; i didn't want to be married and divorced twice. yet as the avett lyrics go: three words became hard to say, i, and love, and you. still, we each held on for dear life. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>in the last five years we've had long periods of disconnection, ships in the night, with me venturing further from home and continuing to heal me but not working too diligently on the us part. some of this drifting away was due in part to unfortunate/unconscious bad choices made around finances that created huge rifts in trust, which have been nearly impossible to overcome, but have ever so slowly been healing over this time from him continuing to rebuild that bridge between us, strengthening the bond of trust necessary for us to have a chance. also, early during this time, chad was experiencing whats called a mental health/mood disorder, with high highs and low lows. he would go from being depressed to being manic. they called it bi-polar and true to our system, put him on drugs and said good luck. he has had to fight like hell to regain his stability and is now drug free, many years later, due to his determination to find the root causes and not just treat the symptoms that were showing up. it’s been a battle and another very difficult spot for us to maneuver through together. chad has always been our workhorse, our bread winner, our rock. his work ethic is a result of the pattern breaking he has managed to do in spite of his up-bringing dictating he fend only for himself. because of his steadiness and desire to “do the right thing” he has not had the free time I've had to do nearly the depth of soul work I've been able to. please, hear me now, i am in no way better than, more healed, or more evolved then chad, not by far.&nbsp; in fact, in so many ways, despite not having the actual free time like i have, he is far more evolved, never ever having stooped to name calling, throwing things, or screaming bloody murder, like i have. i tell you this to say that had he had the same kind of time on his hands, had i been more supportive of him having the time and not hogging it all to myself, it’s more likely we’d/he’d be further on our/his own healing path by now.&nbsp; i’ve been a monster and still he sees the good in me. still he sends me love notes almost daily, brings home flowers weekly, compliments and appreciates me constantly and bends over backwards for my happiness. it’s impressive though undeserved. and i don't take it for granted anymore.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>six months ago he moved out. we decided mutually, after a particularly nasty and vicious fight, to call it quits for a while. we knew we needed the space. we’ve always known we needed the space. but we always said we could never “afford it” and tried to create space in the ways struggling couples do: sleeping in separate rooms, silence, disconnection. now we couldn't afford not to separate if we were to have any chance at cleanly and appropriately turning toward one another again. this time it felt imperative and i did some quick reallocating of resources to make certain we’d have the time and space to consider our future with a break from the seemingly increasing and/or constant bickering and displeasure.&nbsp; we weren't being good to each other often enough.&nbsp; he would try and i would resist. i would try and he would resist. there was a lot of nastiness, resentment and low simmering rage, all misplaced, but nonetheless, present.&nbsp; we had to give each other a break. we are too young to keep bitter hearts.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>in the meantime, i had already committed to my vision quest with chad as my main supporter and promptly broke three bones within a week of him getting another place.&nbsp; time was ticking as i neared the quest and everything became more intense, amplified and called into question. i needed so much help to just live each day, to eat, bathe, and rest, that i had to lean into receiving in a way i could hardly stand. first born capricorn survivors don't do well with receiving but i had to get over it. i needed chad, i needed my friends and i needed my relationship with Great Mystery to lean on. it’s just the way it was and i had to give in a bit, i had to soften. i can be such a tough nut, so still i resisted, still i flailed. i pushed on chad and pulled him back. i dismissed him as my main supporter, holding his desire to be in camp with “my people” hostage, accusing him of not being supportive enough, then daring him to not show up for me. i was scared out of my mind and acting like a whack job! i shoved him away spiritually then groveled on my knees in shards of glass, begging him to do the work with me it would take to set us free, free to just love one another and let the past be the past, to rid ourselves of the old broken dramas and sad stories we clung to, to remember ourselves. to live again. and true to his word and manner, chad was all in. he dove in head first, as uncomfortable as it was for him, to heal his wounds, his shame, his self-worth and his spirit. he found elders, mentors and guides and began unraveling his habits and past, finding new language to, more often than not, speak from a heart centered place. he endured his own ordeal, a primal and transformative weekend rite of passage where a lot died and he was reborn a different man among men. it’s so sexy to see a man step into his soul work, claim it, live, breathe and eat it. we cried a lot during the last six months, went to our separate corners when it got heated, tried again the next day, and slowly proceeded to move toward one another again. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>at some point during the first few months of our separation he asked me if i would be willing to consider making new vows with him if we did in fact choose to reunite. i agreed and prayed and hoped that my heart would find his again after my vision quest, and that his would find mine. you see, the quest put everything in a bit of a holding pattern, a constant spiraling of questions and what-ifs. we both had to get through it, to see what would happen to/with me, who i would be on the other side of it, and him too. we were both reckoning with what it might induce in me, move me to do. would i get a clear signal to stick with it, keep on keeping on, or would i get a clear signal to move along, and stop keeping on? would i know anything at all concerning us?&nbsp; would this living apart go on indefinitely or find its end? neither of us knew what to expect and both of us were terrified of what could happen. the timing was exceptional, the quest, the separation, the broken bones, all of it culminating in a massive supernova of metaphor, shedding, remembering, release, supplication, endurance, softening, hope and faith.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>i wanted to believe i’d know something solidly once i walked off that mountain, that i’d no longer be a woman with a head full of doubt, and after being in silent prayer for four nights with no food or water, fantastically, i did know without a doubt. not only was it all worth it, it was all welcomed and blessed once i completed my quest and quietly rejoined my community. i know we are stardust and moonbeams and human all at once, glorious and fallible. we’ve walked through fire, chad and i, and we are not unscathed; i recognize the consequence of the burnings are the holy scars, lest we forget what it took to find ourselves and one another again. it is clear to me i am meant to stay on path with this beautiful man as my partner and i am so grateful i didn't quit before the miracle because something mythical happened to him as he prayed mightily for me and us in quest camp. he was even more transformed as he danced daily with Spirit, tending the fire that kept us connected while i was away. all present got to witness the deepening magic in him, the embodied man among men, infused with love and light. i am so blessed. i am so grateful for all that i have. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>so here we are, he’s moved back in and we are breathing more deeply into the freedom that is activated in trusting loving partnership. we are about to make our new vows, recommit to one another for the foreseeable future, and i/we am/are asking for your support. it’s not like its just easy now between us, it may be harder than ever actually, so we need some help to keep remembering. we need those who walk in partnership well and with more strength and healing then us, to share what works. we want to have reflected to us that it’s worth it, that its not in vain, that our valiant efforts will be fruitful. what makes you turn back toward one another when forces and stories needle in to divide you?&nbsp; you know us at least a little so what would you say to us to encourage reconnection, continued growth and perseverance?&nbsp; what should we do when our union is rattled, goes off kilter, dares to shake apart? tell us beloved friends, how do you do partnership for the long haul, to join the love of legends, find lightness when it gets dark?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>sacred space will be held for us to speak our heart centered words to one another next saturday september 5th. we are desiring your support in the form of a note, a novel, a saying, a motto, a reading, song lyrics, poetry, or the like. which/what ever you think would suit our re-union. there will be a sweet soul present who is willing to read your offerings to us. and if you feel called, i would love to also have your words handwritten by you if possible, even if you send us something via email to print for the actual reading, you could send the handwritten my snail mail simultaneously. your handwritten keepsake would be an extra generous gift.&nbsp; please honor us with your loving blessings and lived wisdom.&nbsp; we would be so grateful.&nbsp; thank you beloveds.&nbsp; thank you. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
            <p>i’ll tell you we smudged ourselves with white sage this morning and prayed before leaving the house. almost a week has gone by since i returned from Appalachia and we are back at sea-tac airport, together this time. i pulled off planning the top secret mission even with the constant borage of emojis with question marks, i.e. *palm tree ?*, *umbrella ?*, *sunshine ?* - he had no idea where i was taking us for our reunification ceremony. now we are Kauai bound and we are like little kids in a candy store! I still have some surprises up my sleeve. he knows we have upgraded seats and are renting a convertible, that we are staying at a friends rental and that i know where all the nude beaches are, but he doesn't know about all the other little perks and surprises that come with me having free reign on making our travel arrangements. he’s never been to Hawaii and it’s going to blow his ever lovin’ mind. this is going to be so fucking fun and epic and beautiful! and i could care less if it rains the entire time when its 80 degrees every day.&nbsp; baptize us Kauai rain Kahunas, bless us. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>i want to tell you something else. the letter above was originally meant solely for our beloveds but as i wrote it and as our soul family began to respond to it, i felt like it was time to step into trust and be a living, walking, breathing example of the ink emblazoned on my forearm: *i choose authenticity. i am brave, vulnerable and imperfect. i am enough.* i believe strongly that there is most certainly a place for privacy and boundaries, and just to be clear, i am posting this with Chad’s permission. i employ both, boundaries and privacy, to my benefit in situations every single day and i expect you do as well. but i think there’s a time, especially after you’ve come out the other side of a knotted, sticky, fiery walk, whether claiming full and absolute healing, or as in my case, claiming the holy scars and what they stand for, no doubt about it, that it’s more than OK to share parts of our journeys, how we’ve survived and what it took to do so. some might says its essential and crucial to speak of the swampland of the soul challenges, for the sake of ourselves and for others, to not only self-proclaim our victories over the tough shit, but to share experiences that might give others a hand up, to know they aren’t alone. for me, after holding so much close to my chest, it feels like a relief to let it all flow out and away from me, like its here for all of us to decipher and do right by, it’s not just mine to pick apart by myself anymore, and i’m OK with that. i think the darkness fades around the edges when light seeps in from risking cracking ourselves open a bit, when we allow others to witness the excavation of our saltwater souls and honeycomb hearts. i know i feel more empowered and breathe easier when i give myself permission to be seen as my perfectly imperfect self. and i’m convinced that those who matter most to me will grant me lifetime grace cards when i act human and make mistakes, since i’m far from slick, shiny or well put together. i’m messy, raw, savage, and wild. i’m out about it. it’s just me.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>epilogue: woke up in Kauai this morning to the sound or birds and roosters. we’ve just come back from Auntie Angeline’s where we had a 2 hour experience of steam, salt/clay scrub and two on one massages.&nbsp; holy heck, we are melty, slack jawed and drooling on ourselves.&nbsp; now we are going to drive our convertible to get a picnic lunch and take it to the nude beach until sunset.&nbsp; catch ya later, loves.&nbsp; xx</p>
            <p>post script: it's now Autumn 2016 and we are almost done dissolving our marriage contract. it didn't work out, friends. many lies and much secrecy was unveiled and with this knowledge, i choose to burn it all down, step away, and rise again, holy, in a new life, drenched in sovereignty, agency, autonomy and freedom. all is well and i am happy. blessed be.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Hello Sweet Friends</h3>
            <p style="text-align:center">* I will go to a marriage with the owls and the vultures and the juniper trees and the rocks and I’ll not return, though some echo of my body will walk among you *</p>
            <p>I am heading south east toward central Oregon right now, sitting in the backseat, stringing tiny rosebuds in long strands of Beauty. My Vision Quest is underway. From Tuesday to Saturday I will be out on the mountain, in nature, alone, with the clothes on my back and two wool blankets to keep me through the nights. I will be praying in my altar, 5 seven foot tall willow poles I harvested planted in the ground surrounding me, my 784 prayer ties strung across the tops, holding me in sacred space while I sing and dance my prayers to Spirit and Great Mystery. It’s really happening now, after 9 months of preparations, teachings, prayers and surrender. It’s time. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>I’ve been sleeping outside most nights since mid May, acclimating myself to the glorious wonders of night out of doors.&nbsp; We were instructed to start out making ourselves as comfortable as possible. I set up the bed frame inherited from my granny on our little dark woods stage, where we usually hold concerts during the long days of summer, and popped up a canopy for bird poop protection. I went all out, full throttle cush! I slept on my big sheep skin, covered in a down comforter, quilts and wool blankets, favorite pillows to prop my head. There are groups of candles on nightstands and rugs laid to pad our feet. It’s a sweet set up. But more recently Ive had to ween myself from that stellar situation and get myself used to what I am truly in for: 4 nights of sleeping on a bed of cedar, on the ground, with two wool blankets to comfort me.&nbsp; I’m not too concerned about it, even though its not my norm. It’s only 4 nights and I wont be sleeping much anyhow, as per the phenomena of sleep being tied to digestion and since I won’t be digesting, I wont need to sleep. I can do 4 nights. Thats not the part that concerns me. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>I’m going to be vulnerable here and tell you what does concern me, where my fear creeps in and clouds my trust in Spirit, where I waver, where I wobble. It’s around reintegration after this Epic Quest.&nbsp; How will I, what if I can’t, when will I know, where will I go, why does it concern me, who will I be?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Have you ever read&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://coyopa.wordpress.com/">Hedgespoken Tom’s work on Coyopa</a>? I’ve long loved his work.<a target="_blank" href="https://coyopa.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/sometimes-a-wild-god-2/">Sometimes A Wild God</a>&nbsp;is a long time favorite and a quest sister just shared his&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://coyopa.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/nettle-eater/">Nettle-Eater</a>&nbsp;with me. Like, whoa.&nbsp; All in good time. &nbsp;</p>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://coyopa.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/nettle-eater/">Nettle-Eater</a>&nbsp;is so beautifully compelling and spot on for me in this moment. It boldly addresses my greatest fear on the other side of the is quest and soothes its edges to a soft glow. The fear, that I might become so blessed out, so cracked open, or otherwise unraveled out there, that I might not be able to rejoin civilization, might not be able to come back and live low I’ve lived, might not be able to to be “normal enough” within the confines of the culture and society we reside in, is what has been so present during this long walk, all this time. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>Reintegration is what scares the ever lovin shit out of me. Not the dark, not the wild animals, not the no eating/drinking, not the being alone.&nbsp; It’s having to come back, not being able to fully feralize, not having the skills or tools to fit myself back into the box I’ve left behind and have to come back and squeeze into. How will I survive the daily grind afterwards?&nbsp; Will Spirit hold my hand?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Another quest sister who is going out for her third time in nine years shared with me that she can't wait to get out there, that this intense prep stuff is the hardest part, that she looks at her mountain altar as a spa. It was such a gift to have her share this with me and I’ve been holding this vision, of my altar out there being a space of restoration and remembering…re-wilding… my version of a spa. But she said nothing of the return, the coming back, the blending back in that will need to happen. Will I be able to access my altar held self upon my return? Will I be unrecognizable? Will I be able to settle myself back in, meld, merge, intermingle? My mentor, Sweet Medicine Nation, assures me I will go back to my bad habits and old ways in short time upon my return, to not fear being alchemized and transmuted so hardily that I won't find comfort and community in this strange world. I suppose that’s its own kind of solace and I’m holding on to her cheeky advice, letting it nestle in where spirit meets bone. &nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align:center">*I am looking at the world beyond my door and my life is on fire.&nbsp; I am running, diving in, though surely it means death. I am seeking something unknown, unknowable.&nbsp; I know the names of it but the beast itself roams out beyond the edges and in the deep center of things. *</p>
            <p>As ever, I am living in the questions, these among many others. I imagine they will persist on the other side of this grand adventure, while the answers I seek will be revealed in right time.&nbsp; All in right time, all in right time. &nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>In other news:</strong></span></p>
            <p>(if you'd like to get info every new moon on my offerings, whereabouts and transgressions, sign up for my newsletter by clicking the banner at the bottom of the home page on my website at&nbsp;jennettenielsen.com)<br><br>We have just 4 spots left for our upcoming fall&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wildrootssacredwings.com/">Wild Roots Sacred Wings</a>&nbsp;retreat&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wildrootssacredwings.com/ojai/">in Ojai, California</a>.

            <p><span>i said i wanted to go at daybreak again, to slip into the warm wet sea while the sky was still deep velvety indigo blue-black yet slowly and surely turning salmon and tangerine with ease and grace.&nbsp;<br><br>we didn't go at daybreak.&nbsp; i was having the most intense, vivid yet ethereal dreams while i was in Oaxaca and when it was time to slink out of bed in the cool dark, my body wished to stay and my mind desired dreaming the perfect strangeness.&nbsp; too, i’ll admit it, i was uncertain about submerging in the water under the cover of night, not being able to see what creatures were swimming around and beneath me.&nbsp; i trust and respect Her, Mama Ocean, and i also like to see what She is drawing near me, introducing me to, showing me. &nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>daybreak would have been the time to go for sheer and utter seclusion but who needs isolation when you’d rather just never wear clothes at all, most especially in that climate?&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>we meandered our way to the radiant turquoise sea before mid-day.&nbsp; there were families and couples, kids and elders.&nbsp; not crowded in the least but there were watchers and i choose to not mind.&nbsp; we plopped down under our sunbrella in the white powder sand and prepared for our underwater photo session.</span></p>
            <p><span>there is this gorgeous sweet little bay area at san agustinillo beach in oaxaca.&nbsp; it’s between the two longer stretches of beach, and it’s only a bay in that it’s vaguely enclosed by some rock and reef outcroppings, making the waves ever so slightly less intense and allowing for the cradling of amazing sea life.&nbsp; i wanted my annual birthday (suit) photo shoot in this faint cove so we did it, among the families and couples, kids and elders. &nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>we swam out just beyond the furthest out humans.&nbsp; we could still touch the sandy bottom.&nbsp; i was giddy.&nbsp; chad felt lucky.&nbsp; i handed him my bikini, which he looped over his arm, and he began taking photos. i swam away. i swam back. i floated tits up. i dove to the bottom.&nbsp; i didn't care who thought this or saw that and although latin american culture is far more reserved and modest, no one seemed to mind.&nbsp; topless sun bathing is not uncommon here so swimming nude didn't feel like much of a stretch anyhow.&nbsp; i flipped and flopped, plunged and pitched, dipped and dunked.&nbsp; it felt like freedom.&nbsp; it felt like being me. &nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>the blessing and gift of getting to be on vacation each turning of the new year wheel, for my past many birthdays, at the warm seashore, with my beloveds, is not lost on me.&nbsp; these are the days, my friends, the ones i live for and love.&nbsp; this is the life.&nbsp; and i cherish it with my entire&nbsp;saltwater soul, i do.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>this is a quick, &nbsp;down and dirty little Make-to-Mend DIY on making surprise treasure walnut ornaments. &nbsp;when we make and give/gift to others, we heal. &nbsp;it feels good. &nbsp;we can show our love and care by taking the time to hand make with loving healing intentions. &nbsp;my kids and i made a lot of these sweet treats when they were small and since i just made one for a dear friend, i thought i would snap a few images and show you how simple, yet sweet, this easy Make-to-Mend craft is. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>English walnuts work best, because they are large and split easily down the side seams of the nut. &nbsp;you can order them online if you don't have a local source where you live or ask a well connected friend to send/trade you some!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>i always start my Making sessions by smudging myself and my space with white sage, palo santo, or yerba santa, to clear the energy while seducing and welcoming in Mystery, Spirit and the Muse. &nbsp;i also make my tea, tune in my music or podcast, and sometimes pull a card for insight and guidance. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>here i've used a regular old store bought walnut because i was out of the english variety. i use my nut cracking tools, namely a pick, and i do this part myself if kids are trying to help out, so that i am the only one with a chance of getting stabbed! once you get the nuts cracked open on the nut seam, scoop out the nut meat and set it aside for a snack or eat as you go!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>so the fun and silly thing is, once you make and gift these, they get cracked back open! &nbsp;it's like a sweet little surprise package. &nbsp;a thoughtful small token of love. &nbsp;my kids and i used to make several before winter solstice, tag them so we knew who they would go to, and then hang them on our tree until it was time to package and send them. &nbsp;they loved making them for their friends and they also loved when i made them some in secret as well. &nbsp;these would be a fun way to do advent for your kids or for someone you love, a fun hanukkah or twelfth night celebration gift, and would be fun at the spring equinox and Ostara as well. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>love, sweet love,</p>

            <p>for the first ten years he would ask: marry me? and i would respond: when you buy me a rock. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>it was a goofy little joke between us. by rock i meant big fat huge diamond and we both knew i was full of shit. &nbsp;carat plus compressed carbon nuggets that cost more than our first home down payment have never been sexy to me the way they are for other women. but i would say it, fending him off, still trying to decide if i'd care to be married again (for a 2nd time), contemplating wether it really mattered or not, with two kids, a home, and a passionately dynamic yet often times difficult life between us. &nbsp;i thought i could get away with not having to really talk/face marriage by using the rock joke since i knew he'd never get his hands on one and wouldn't have picked one out for me on his own if he had the money anyhow (i am a first born Capricorn, after all, he is well aware!).</p>
            <p>when we met he didn't wear shoes. &nbsp;i drove a vw bus. &nbsp;his hair was dreading. &nbsp;i shaved no hair on my body. &nbsp;he ate tomatoes on a sandwich i made, which he disliked immensely at the time, on our first date hiking up a mountain. &nbsp;i spilled an entire keg cup of beer in his car the night we met. &nbsp;i was flying and driving to Dead shows. &nbsp;he was an apprentice plumber and military drop out. he was living back at home. &nbsp;i was living back at home. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>one day, right before meeting and the subsequent Summer of Love (1994!), &nbsp;i was driving out of town one way and he was driving by the other way. &nbsp;the sun was setting. &nbsp;it was that drive-by scene from the movies, where time slowed in motion as we passed one another, craning our necks to really check each other out. &nbsp;we both say now we were thinking the same thing: is that who i think it is and how do i get in the same room with her/him. &nbsp;i went straight home to the house next door to my parents, which i was sharing with my brother, who always had his girlfriend over, still my best friend to this day, and begged them both, please help me get this guy and i in the same vicinity. &nbsp;as it turned out, this guy and i had gone to high school together, he a year younger. &nbsp;and there was even a group photo of us in my senior yearbook, having both been voted "most fashionable" in our classes. &nbsp;imagine. &nbsp;so, there was that. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>so we met. &nbsp;i spilled the beer. &nbsp;he left his container of herb in my room so i knew he'd come back. &nbsp;i lived on a lake so he would come over and lay on the dock with me after work each day. i took him to my families property on the olympic peninsula for a weekend. &nbsp;i walked ahead of him on a trail and he said: i'd sure like to have that swing in my back yard. &nbsp;and i fell for it, you guys. &nbsp;totally. &nbsp;he listened to reggae non-stop and said he would marry me one day because i was the only girl he knew who knew all the words to all the songs and could sing along. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>six weeks in, at twenty-one years old, &nbsp;i was pregnant, miraculously for the first time ever, and i took it as a sign, a direction for my life. &nbsp;by then my folks had told us we were no longer welcome to "play house" in the home next-door to theirs so we had found a tiny studio apartment to move into. &nbsp;i remember coming home from taking a pee test at the free clinic, having been counseled there to consider all options as my future, according to them, looked like welfare and poverty if i choose to become a mom then, college unfinished, unmarried, divorced. i said to Chad: this is it. &nbsp;i am having a baby. &nbsp;you can stay or go. &nbsp;if you stay, consider it a commitment, "like" marriage. &nbsp;no back door. &nbsp;working through whatever hard stuff comes. &nbsp;he cried, said i'm not going anywhere, and here we are, two kids, twenty years later, still at it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>so for the first ten years we have this joke about the rock between us. &nbsp;marriage isn't really on the agenda. &nbsp;we felt a bit meh about it, whatever. &nbsp;and then he goes and gets me this rock. &nbsp;the Marry Me Rock. &nbsp;and we had a real good gut busting laugh over the rock, it was no diamond but it was the right rock for me. &nbsp;obviously. &nbsp;and i keep my agreements, so ten years ago today we married. &nbsp;A Samhain celebration, barefoot outside, under trees lit with lanterns at twilight, circled by all our friends and family. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>babe, when you read this and cry, because i know you will and it's one of the things i love most about you, that you wear your heart on the outside, unarmored, uncrossed, fully in it, exposed and willing, able to shed tears often and much for all the breathtaking beauty and deep pain that life delivers, just know that you are loved, hard, to the moon and back. i thank my lucky stars that i kept my agreement to marry you when you gave me "a rock," the right rock, the one for me. &nbsp;i'm in it with you, forever. &nbsp;xx</p>

            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">As I slowly unfurl from the otherworldly smooth cocoon of retreating in Ojai with magical beings, my awareness expands and I can sense some pieces of my experiences, ancient and brand new, connecting and coming full circle, while I step delicately back into linear time and space.&nbsp; </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It doesn't hurt at all, this connecting, snapping and clicking into place. It’s a kind of tidying up plus a sigh of relief, even if temporarily, as if I had been an unfinished anthropomorphic jigsaw puzzle, expelling a heaving exhale as my last few odd-sized shapes were finally able to nestle in, finding their just right spot. It’s akin to experiencing some sense of conclusion, not realizing I’d been holding my breath for far too long, waiting on the feeling of being complete.&nbsp; And here I am, deep breathing again, reveling in the freedom of amplification and contraction, basking in the full circle experience that comes with drawing in and out, my pieces knowing they fit.&nbsp; </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It could be more of a cracking wide open rather than a sliding into place, all my morsels settling in the dust of the cleaving and falling. &nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s both.&nbsp; Can’t it be both?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Regardless, it doesn’t hurt, this congealing or rupturing, whichever it is.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no sting, only relief. &nbsp;It just feels like I’ve come out the other side of something I was trying to get a grip on, trying to understand.&nbsp; It’s like I can finally see things that had been obscured or held just too far beyond my peripheral vision, and now they have come into focus.&nbsp; I have clarity where before there was cloudiness and uncertainty.&nbsp; It feels like a full circle settling into the deep understanding of a few things that had strayed from my knowing, eluded me, and now they have re-nested in, cozied into my bones, the truth of them now so obvious but luckily not painful.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">My word for the year is Emerge.&nbsp; And wouldn’t you know it, you’re damned if you do Emerge and you’re damned if you don’t Emerge.&nbsp; My own Emerging, in many forms, the more visible of which includes being asked to co-host retreat gatherings, being asked to guide at retreat gatherings, and hosting my own Make-to-Mend gatherings, has sparked bucket loads of support and encouragement from those who love and appreciate me enough to be uplifting.&nbsp; I relish this and bask in the sweetness of recognition and belonging.&nbsp; These dear friends can see me, and see themselves in me; we reflect possibility and expansion to one another.&nbsp; </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">But then there are those whose feathers are ruffled by others’ Emerging, by my Emerging.&nbsp; A wise friend told me that oddly this indicates I am doing something exactly right, that I am on path, I am releasing an old story of myself and creating a new one with velocity. &nbsp;When we Emerge it can be triggering and provocative, making people uncomfortable, leaving them wishing we’d go back to being our old less growth-spurty selves.&nbsp; They narcissistically make it all about them, as if you are intentionally trying to cause them a specific kind of pain in your own Emerging. &nbsp;Their feathers get ruffled from jealousy, their own lack of self-worth and their shortage of maturity.&nbsp; They may even tell you that the only reason you are Emerging is because you are the “little darling” and they may then go on to collaborate with a mutual friend who they also labeled a “little darling,” and you will wonder at your naivete. &nbsp;And yes, this may come from your dearest sweet sister, who you trusted and held in high esteem,&nbsp; who you believed would rise to the occasion and celebrate your Emerging with you.&nbsp; But fret not.&nbsp; This too shall pass.&nbsp; In the wake of your immense pain and disbelief, when your Emerging plows full steam ahead and you get on the other side of it, the side where you click into place or crack wide open with a new understanding of the space you inhabit, all will be OK, my dear, all will be right.&nbsp; You will come to wish your un-supporters well, the ones whose skin you got under, the ones who turned away and put up a wall.&nbsp; You will even regain and come to have an unfathomable and whole-hearted love for them, especially since they prompted this shift in you, this lucidity on the other side, because you will know: it’s not about you.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will have your guides and mentors to thank, your sisters who do stand by your side through thick and thin to thank, and time itself to thank for the perpetual turning of the wheel.&nbsp; You will not only survive the initial growing pains yourself, but you will painlessly Emerge a bright star who can see clearly and be clearly seen. &nbsp;You will thrive. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Right now I am basking in the stillness that comes after being in sacred circle with sacred women who are cultivating their wild roots and sacred wings.&nbsp; This serenity is born of the sweet sip of lingering magic these enchanting women offered, settling in profoundly, its nectar soothing my soul.&nbsp; There is so much comfort in the aftermath, knowing that together we are becoming the peaceful, bold, love-laden women we intend to be.&nbsp; Even in the Mystery and the spaces in between, when old and new are juxtaposed too angularly, making the path less clear or the journey more awkward, we have one another to reflect our courage and wisdom.&nbsp; We asked Spirit to guide the right women to gather with us and gratefully, powerful women full of contradiction and shifting paradigm, yet solid and centered like the mountains surrounding us there in Ventura county, floated in on sweet scented zephyrs, ready to create, connect and restore together.&nbsp; </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I found a portal in Ojai, a gateway to abundant riches, and if you lean in just so I will whisper in your ear the secret spot: it’s a circle of brave women who dare to carve out the time and space to step into exquisite self-care, thereby blooming into, and remembering, their truest and highest potential.&nbsp; If and when you find yourself stepping into one of these luminous portal circles, prepare to lay down your heart armor, as there will be no need for keeping a barbed wire cage around your magnified heart.&nbsp; In fact, here you will lay all your weapons down, your gremlins and busyness will fade and instead you’ll take up the tools of Making and Mending.&nbsp; And this is another piece that clicked into place and cracked me open while co-hosting this retreat: permission to tune into our own frequencies and listen carefully for our soul’s deepest longing, is no small thing.&nbsp; It is transformational.&nbsp; I knew this.&nbsp; I know this.&nbsp; But my perception had always been from the standpoint of a retreat participant, not a host, and that’s different, way different.&nbsp; What I was privileged to witness was extraordinary and solidly confirmed for me that women who claim space for their innate creative self-expression to blossom, recover empowerment and their healing flourishes.&nbsp; Certain and clear, no doubt about it:&nbsp; click, crack, connect.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;Another clicking and cracking, or full circle coming, if you will: </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">So I've spent the last 20 years with one lover, and I would be a big fat fucking liar if I didn't admit it has been one hell of a tumultuous ride.&nbsp; The combination of us both bringing childhood trauma and very little healing in from the get go, not to mention being young and naive, did not give us a solid footing to begin with.&nbsp; We have had to fight long and hard to keep our partnership (in the midst of actually fighting and being very unkind to one another, more often than I’d like to admit, some might call it screaming, ranting and raving) intact: &nbsp;hours and years of therapy, lots of space/time/separation, time in nature, rehab, seeking spiritual growth, medication, meditation, you name it, we've tried it, all in an effort to pull through and not end up divorced, like our parents, many times over.&nbsp; You might be able to imagine that finding myself pregnant, six weeks into the relationship, didn't contribute to any easy beginning either.&nbsp; But we soldiered on.&nbsp; </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Within our first five years together we found a therapist we loved and who we stayed with for many years.&nbsp; Early on, we told her our vision for our relationship included being elderly together, sitting on our front porch in our rocking chairs, holding hands.&nbsp; I can’t type that out, let alone say it, without tearing up.&nbsp; She brought us back to that point, over and over.&nbsp; Every time we went in and had given up, asking her to walk us through separation and divorce, she reminded us we’d said that and had made that agreement and promise to one another.&nbsp; Lots of times it pissed us off.&nbsp; Several times we’d regretted we’d mentioned it.&nbsp; And countless times we were thankful but not until way later, numerous years later. So we limped along, gathering tools for the journey and learning to seek solutions instead of simmering in blame, resentment and anger.&nbsp; Once in a while we had fun and even enjoyed spending time alone together.&nbsp; This became just ever so slightly recurrent as our kids got older.&nbsp; We hung in there.&nbsp; But it was frequently rough and I was often looking for exit strategies.&nbsp; </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Fast forward to last Tuesday night.&nbsp; I was flying in from Santa Barbara and Chad was picking me up at Sea-Tac.&nbsp; Jasper was still at his grandpa’s, Gus had moved out, and we were going to have the house to ourselves.&nbsp; I had been gone 9 days, leaving a mere week after spending 5 nights in New Orleans together, alone, celebrating our twenty year anniversary, alone, and&nbsp; I missed him, finally, after all these years.&nbsp; We had such a blast in NOLA; eating, biking, listening, taking it all in, BEING ALONE!&nbsp; &nbsp;We stayed in a straight up Love Shack if you know what I’m sayin!&nbsp; So more than two weeks after NOLA I fly in from Santa Barbara, get my luggage and hop in the truck when he pulls up to the curb, dying to be alone with him again. &nbsp;&nbsp;And this is the part where some of my BIG pieces begin falling into place: unrequested he hands me a small cooler full of ice, and a giant convenience store cup full of ice with a lid and straw.&nbsp; Inside the cooler is a hard apple cider and a kombucha to choose from and also baggies of sliced cheese, salami and rice crackers.&nbsp; I snack and we talk and touch and laugh while catching up.&nbsp; &nbsp;He brings me hOMe to a tidy nest; plants alive on the deck, gardens bulging, bees drifting, animals fed and watered, clean sheets on the bed and all the laundry done.&nbsp; I jump in the shower to cleanse off the travel grime and when I emerge, candle light and incense fill the bedroom.&nbsp; Full circle.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Never have I been so in love with this man.&nbsp; Finally, I look forward to being with him, especially alone. In my more frequent travels of late I’ve gained a new appreciation for all he does to support us, mostly happily and satisfyingly, allowing me to pursue the work I love to do out in the world.&nbsp; On the car ride home from the airport he said, “Look at you.&nbsp; It’s amazing what you are doing.&nbsp; Look where it’s going and where it’s come from.&nbsp; It’s just so cool. You did this.&nbsp; You are doing this!” And that’s when I sob and feel immensely blessed by my good fortune, our hard work, and him, because he did this as much as I did and we are in this together.&nbsp; Without his constant love, support and growth, I would not be Emerging, not like this.&nbsp; I am settling into a deep knowing that when we do our personal soulwork, everything shifts and we do transform. So much has changed over the last couple years, in ways I never imagined possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, we have set backs, yes we do.&nbsp; But we are winning in this relationship the more cracked open we each become, the more our pieces shift and situate into place just so.&nbsp; I could have endured double the pain in the lessons learned along the way if I’d known it was going to be this good on the other side. &nbsp;More of my pieces are fitting into the whole of me.&nbsp; I am coming more and more home to myself, with my wild roots and sacred wings.&nbsp; I am the full circle.</span></p>

            <p>this little blog of mine, i’m gonna let it shine.</p>
            <p>paralysis. &nbsp;it wrapped its sticky, long, binding, curling tentacles around me.&nbsp; constricted my voice, filled my head full of doubt, turned my writing fingers to stone. &nbsp;as each day ticked by since my last blog post It made the effort seem too epic and the void too astronomical, the gap in time too wide to leap gracefully back across.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>well today is the day i kick paralysis’s ass, with practice. &nbsp;i’m back. &nbsp;the tentacles have been weakened, released, returned to their rightful owner.&nbsp; &nbsp;this is the longest i've gone without blogging. so I’ll tell you some of what’s been going on and coming up.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>i spent november making up a storm for the Maker’s Market i was preparing for at the beginning of december. &nbsp;then i went to Mexico for 3 weeks. here are some photos i love from that trip:</p>

           <div class="sqs-block-content">
            <p>in Mexico i had time to write, by hand, and read 4 books. &nbsp;i devoured two <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Solnit">Rebecca Solnit</a> books and it stimulated some reflection, thank the Goddess. &nbsp;mostly questions. &nbsp;which I will try to articulate here so we all have something to chew on…</p>
            <p>have you ever had the experience of having a long held wish suddenly and unexpectedly granted?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>what do you do, how do you respond? &nbsp;does the abruptness startle you? &nbsp;do you get confused, back down, back up, give up? &nbsp;are you an automatic Yes? &nbsp; is it a landmark or a dividing point? &nbsp;is the voice of caution, duty, fear, appeasement or danger in your head?</p>
            <p>does your adventurous streak go limp or get a boner?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>what’s your reflex, you impulse? have you turned down adventure for duty, safety, thrift or security? &nbsp;have you reflexively dismissed or declined a wish come true and felt wistful, grieving or mourning that choice?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>do you surround yourself with beacons, people who light the way, go before you, that you can emulate, take inspiration from, follow in their steps?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>who is watching when you make these choices; say the Yes or No, to unexpected granted wishes? your kids, peers, parents, partners? &nbsp;who is soaking it in, being tutored by your choices, taking cues on and internalizing how to respond when their own wishes are granted? &nbsp;</p>
            <p>stick with me…</p>
            <p>how often do you choose the unknown? how often do you turn down a chance to live or be wild?</p>
            <p>do you know yourself? &nbsp;do you think you do? do you think it’s dangerous to not know yourself? what of your inner landscape? &nbsp;do you suffer? &nbsp;or hide from yourself through dissociation or projection, deceptions or justifications?</p>
            <p>have you ever considered a wish granted as an intervention? a rescue? saving you from an arduous time? &nbsp;a key to a prison door, a raft in a shipwreck?</p>
            <p>granted wishes are doorways, portals, to adventure and possibility.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>you can step into the unknown, the wild, through a door you make of the word YES.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>i am practicing this as a small chunk of long held wishes are suddenly and unexpectedly being granted. &nbsp;even practice takes practice. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>are you familiar with the term *wish granting jewel* or *wish fulfilling jewel* or the idea of a *philosopher’s stone*? &nbsp;&nbsp;they are” jewels or substances” that have the power to produce whatever one desires: perfection, enlightenment, heavenly bliss and beyond. &nbsp;they are metaphors for our minds.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>as<a target="_blank" href="http://jennettenielsen.com/recognition-belonging/"> i am my own anam cara</a>, i am also my own wish fulfilling/granting jewel and philosopher’s stone.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>the power is within me to manifest and produce whatever i desire. &nbsp;this is not at the cost of others but in fact in alignment to reflect and amplify other’s abilities to be their own jewels and stones. &nbsp;to mineralize their own deep empowerment. &nbsp;to become their own beloved.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>this is how i become my own jewel, how you can too:</p>
            <p>1. A Practice of Permission. to want what i want and to allow myself the ability to go after it.&nbsp; to let myself be capable, to belonging to myself, to not be perfect, to be a student. &nbsp;i no longer withhold from myself. &nbsp; i say Yes to myself to make room for possibility, adventure and wildness.</p>
            <p>2. A Practice of Release and Shed. i examine shadow, deal with it, and move on. &nbsp;no dwelling. &nbsp;no regrets. &nbsp;no clinging. &nbsp;i am human. &nbsp;and shedding/releasing makes room for more goodness.</p>
            <p>3. A Practice of Curiosity and Observation. &nbsp;i watch carefully for the teachable moments, the occasions that school me, comfortable or not, and be curious about them rather than judgmental, closed or shut against them. &nbsp; i don’t know everything. &nbsp;i’m still human.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>4. A Practice of Attention and Tracking.&nbsp; Spirituality, Nature, Art and Community. &nbsp;where am i in these?&nbsp; too much too little? &nbsp;if one is far out of alignment it is likely i am demineralizing! and then it’s time to tug on some threads.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>5. A Practice of Make-to-Mend. &nbsp;daily attention to the creative self-expression of my fullness as a means to empowerment and healing. &nbsp;it’s ceremony, ritual and prayer to energetically activate my well-being. &nbsp;it keeps me alive and some would argue sane.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>so this is my off the cuff list. &nbsp;by no means exhaustive and official but a rough sketch. &nbsp;an outline of what I try to keep in mind and practice. practice over perfection. practice over paralysis. practice and process. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>it allows me to be my own jewel. &nbsp;it lets me shine. &nbsp;and be solid, semi-precious.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>(the spectator in me would call for a steaming cup of chocolate pu-erh and a long slow leisurely scroll through the photos...)&nbsp;</p>
            <p>what you'll see is parts of my unedited tousled abode on the day my pilgrimage sister,&nbsp;<a href="http://gypsylovecafe">Katariina Agnes Fagering</a>&nbsp;stopped by for a visit with her camera. &nbsp;she captured my "real" house, how we live in it daily, how our loot spilleth over, how crammed with our personal significant treasures it is...</p>
            <p>you've likely heard me blather on about my love of creating enchanted, bewitched, and spellbinding spaces. &nbsp;about how our senses are nourished through a sacred visual narrative and about the amplified ethereal vibrancy and pulse lurking in the corners and just under the surface. &nbsp;about creating expressive ambiance intentionally and deliberately so it is meaningful and revealing. &nbsp;soulful, strange, ordinary and accessible. &nbsp;it's creative assemblage with punctuated quirks wherein the collection of evocative objects speak a magical language to one another and exist in harmony.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>this is what i believe. &nbsp;it's what i tell myself and my clients. &nbsp;it's what i know to be true.</p>
            <p>this is the space where i create my magic, that holds me, womb like, that comforts and consoles me. &nbsp;this is where i do my make-to-mend practice. where i am reminded that spirit, peace and affluence abound and surround me. it's my space and i share it with you. enjoy. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6em;">hello wonderful supportive you:</span></p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal">i am back from my priestess pilgrimage to the UK and i am recuperating as i type this.&nbsp; jet-lag and re-entry have taken up most of the week so far.&nbsp; i had a massage today in hopes of grounding back into my body.&nbsp; the feeling of floating and buoyancy, as much of a natural high as it can be, does not mesh well with the daily grind of life.&nbsp; so i look for ways to get present, be here, stay focused and regain productivity.&nbsp; and too, i am happily arranging and rearranging all the blessed altar embellishments i brought home for myself, much of it the same adornments and trimmings i gathered for you!&nbsp; </p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal">short of retyping it all here, i would ask you to take a peek at my blog post about what i managed to discover about myself, once again, while gallivanting across the land, visiting the sacred holy sites and flitting about, as if gossamer winged, in fae land.&nbsp; the veil was growing ever thin there, as it is here as well, and it was most righteously noticeable.&nbsp; you can read my account, i am a pilgrim, <a href="http://jennettenielsen.com/smashingrubbish/2013/10/8/priestess-pilgrimage-part-1">here</a>.</p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal">i hope and daydream for each of you that one day you go to visit the hallowed and ancient sites of the UK and that you too get to experience the pulse and vitality present there.&nbsp; the amplified divine left me weeping several times and found me speechless often. i peered into the eye of each priestess among us, when words failed us and our eyes spilled over with salty hot tears. in those hotbeds of truth you get to experience what is beyond the epic.&nbsp; it was cleansing, reassuring, and solidified my dedication to sisterhood and adventure.&nbsp; i am still unraveling and deciphering the throbbing secret messages, just for me, that the sea, land, wind, stones, and water offered up.&nbsp; </p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal">in your <a href="http://jennettenielsen.com/i-forage-you-gather-uk-edition/">forage/gather boxes</a> you shall find what might resemble an altar, once you have it all unpacked and arranged just so.&nbsp; there is a sacred visual narrative theme of natural elements, charms, enchantments and magic woven throughout.&nbsp; You may find your arrangement is a meaningful and revealing display and not just a random collection of unrelated objects.&nbsp; as pilgrimage loot, a spellbinding energy may be generated in the way each of the evocative objects interacts with one another.&nbsp; there becomes a soulful vibration that is greater than the sum of its parts.&nbsp; i will be curious to see if, after creating an expressive ambiance through altar assemblage, you feel a certain magnetism, a pull, in the creative collection of your pilgrimage treasures. based on my experience, it won’t surprise me if the combination of objects and the visual narrative they evoke disclose a spiritual awareness rather than a specific meaning. &nbsp;the items chose me and they chose you. i hope you find yourself drawn in, bewitched, ever wonder-filled and craving more! </p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal">thank you for trusting me to tune in and essentially take you on this trek with me.&nbsp; you were there with me as i traversed the Tor in Glastonbury, as i skimmed the stones in Avebury, dug the flint, scouted the chalk, picked the flowers, perused the books, became wind swept in Tintagel, climbed the steps, bent over the Chalice Well, watched the sun set while the mists rolled in, welcomed day break and bird song, tasted the ciders, scoured the flea markets in Bath and London, touched the ruins, shed the tears, and belly laughed while making up songs about sheep shit and practicing my british accent.&nbsp; thank you for encouraging my journey by supporting my business.&nbsp; thank you for allowing the seeker, wanderer and adventurer in me to partake in this excursion and settle into pilgrim mode.&nbsp; thank you for your support, from my deepened tender heart. </p> 
            <p class="MsoNormal">i appreciate you.&nbsp; thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>i could feel the salty hot tears on my wind kissed skin.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>i could taste the dry cider, streaky bacon and mushy peas.</p>
            <p>i could see the rainless clouds, against the vibrant blue sky, over the dramatic stones, &nbsp;as they sailed into the mystic.</p>

            <p>i attuned myself to this priestess pilgrimage, with this particular soulful coven of women, lifetimes ago...as it turns out...every cell in my body remembers them. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>and i understand why i was requested to be on this spiritual trek, this time, besides the reunion and communion. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>in this blessed lifetime i've been once again paired with my beloved sister-cousin who guided me through my formative years in the ways of wild witchery and pagan catholicism. &nbsp;you may have heard me tell tale<a href="http://jennettenielsen.com/witch-roots/"> here</a>.</p>
            <p>so not only was i carrying out a portion of my personal manifest destiny as revealed and gifted to me throughout my life/lives, but i was also making waves, setting sparks, and honoring the magical realism, mythology and vision that is my birthright. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>on this holy land, stones, trees, wells, sacred flames, and wind collude with the elements they are born of to be the tethers that ground me and inform me. &nbsp;they are the portals that allow my pain and suffering to be alchemized and transmuted. &nbsp;air moves me, fire transforms me, water shapes me and earth heals me. &nbsp;as i widen and expand the macro lens of my own perception, the high vibration and palpable heartbeat, just below the surface of things, Her heartbeat, Her ancient rhythm and wisdom, rise up to meet me. &nbsp;and i am struck by a deep well of breathtaking awe. &nbsp;i am comforted, i feel safe, i trust and i forgive. &nbsp;i am here to understand the abundant affluence i am steeped in daily and i give way in gratitude. &nbsp;</p>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">by the time i was 4 years old my mom had married a monster, unbeknownst to us all at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; we didn’t know he was a monster at first, because he didn't<i> look </i>like one.&nbsp; he didn’t <i>appear</i> scary, mean, nasty or vicious. he didn’t<i> present </i>hideous skin, oversized appendages or snarling teeth.&nbsp; this monster passed off like a gentle human, smelled clean and fresh,&nbsp; faithfully attended church and lived a moderate middleclass life in the suburbs.&nbsp; no, visually,&nbsp; your eyeballs would have never registered monster, or even crazed lunatic.&nbsp; but those amazing globe-shaped orbs inside their sockets cannot always ascertain sly, sneaky, cunning monsterishness by observing an outward appearance.&nbsp; this person was a deviant, conniving, covert monster on the inside.&nbsp; a putrid, sick, less than human, life-sucking leach, of the lowest form. yes,&nbsp; he most certainly was.&nbsp; he was a child molester and i was his darling, tricked, sweet, confused target for 7 long years.<br> </span>
             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">i am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse.</span>
             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">don’t feel sorry for me.&nbsp; just see me where i stand.&nbsp; behold me.</span>
             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">i tell you this in an effort to take back my power: to become empowered, to become real, to shed the prickly cloak of secret keeper and rebirth myself&nbsp; anew.&nbsp; i tell you this to lean into and live up to my calligraphied arm tattoo:" i choose authenticity. i am brave, vulnerable and imperfect.&nbsp; i am enough." i tell you this to be seen: honest, bare, revealing.&nbsp; i tell you this to cultivate my own shame resilience: ordinary courage, dream weaver, creative wise woman .&nbsp;&nbsp; i tell you this because i have survived, sometimes barely intact, more often than not hanging on by a thread, yet alive, and living with the battle scars, bruises and bewilderment of being knocked the fuck down, so to speak.&nbsp; i tell you this to do something big.&nbsp; yes, this is my truth.</span>
             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">and yet.&nbsp; still i journey. still i dream.&nbsp; still i seek healing.&nbsp; a wanderer, always and ever spiraling inward and outward, grasping elusive bits of star dust and slippery magical moon beams. me,&nbsp; burning bright, shining, electric, pulsing,&nbsp; reaching, soaring, stretching.&nbsp; but always, always, furling back again, folding inward, dark solitude, a hot mess of&nbsp; fear, questioning, angry, rageful, blaming and untrusting. temporarily defeated, the wall goes up, old wounds fester and seep, vulnerability sprouts wings and vanishes while i&nbsp; choose smallness and jealousy, in a wicked shame spiral of despair and humiliation. this one beautiful life: seemingly stolen, subverted, mangled, ruined, corrupted.<br> </span>
             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">and yet, i refuse to let it have me, to own me, to work me like a puppet.</span>
             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">i am giving myself permission to fly because i have been told there is life outside the cage.</span>
             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">don’t feel sorry for me. my life is not horrid.&nbsp; i have had many years worth of smiles, belly laughs and high times.&nbsp; I am college educated in the arts, i am a trained community centered herbalist, i have two beautiful sons, and a partner who continues to allow me to grow, die and be reborn again.&nbsp; i have submerged myself in a community of women and friends that i can trust, feel safe with, let see me and be real real with.&nbsp; I am an artist, a maker, a studio and vintage shop owner.&nbsp; Boho-Naturalist styling, decoration and design is my gift and prayer. i am a honeybee keeper,&nbsp; a mother-ocean loving surfer, a horseback rider and a wanna be world traveler. and here i write.&nbsp; i am a writer, a weaver of words and a teller of truths.&nbsp; i am me and here i am: aspiring to live and love with my whole heart</span>
             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">this one beautiful life was cobbled together on a marathon,&nbsp; a running, if you will, away from and back to myself, depleted,&nbsp; over and over again, tired, cyclical, exhausted, a pattern. Therapy, and therapy, and more therapy.&nbsp; tiny&nbsp; bits of me unearthed and exposed, little by little, dusted and shined but not always lovely.&nbsp;&nbsp; a crystal in the rough.&nbsp; in fact, rather mostly hard to look at, the shattered edges, the sticking stinking mucky grime, unbreakable, unuseful, old protective modes, wounds that won’t rest in peace, sending me running from myself again.&nbsp; untimely attempts at shifting the energy leaving me sprinting like a rat on its wheel, wondering when to jump but instead just hanging in there, one more round, utterly thirsting to run into myself, me, myself, hoping to find me, myself, like an old friend waiting with open arms.&nbsp; but no, the running went on and on and on.</span>
             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">but now it's done.&nbsp; i've crossed the finish line of this 39 year marathon.&nbsp;&nbsp; i'm jumping off the wheel.&nbsp; and i'm two things.&nbsp; I am thirsty and i want to fall down.&nbsp; hard.&nbsp; and&nbsp; i want the running me to splatter on a surface that will crack me wide open and let all the dis-eased, unfulfilling ,broken down bits of me&nbsp; scatter to the healing eastern winds.&nbsp; and i want to drink up,&nbsp; gulp down and cultivate the pieces of me that serve me, the seeds that help me serve others, the bits that give me purpose and light and freedom.&nbsp; i will grow, nourished and fed, ever reaching, thickening, becoming succulent and juicy in my new skin, tendrils finding their hold.&nbsp; i will live and love with my whole heart and i am hot-damn determined to reclaim what is rightfully mine and be fully selfish in my loving myself, tending my inner fire, stoking a life that is abundantly full of star dust and moon beams.&nbsp; there shall be no end to me, just wide open space and affluence, glowing and radiant.&nbsp; beauty, love and passion.</span>
             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">so blame it on my wild heart.&nbsp; it has been broken and busted flat yet it won’t give up.&nbsp; it just keeps asking the questions, searching for answers, growing stronger with each veil lifted, with each step toward the signs that reveal answers, to a hoped for understanding, a making sense, a wanted deep knowing of direction, path, meaning.&nbsp; what to do with this one beautiful life and this incessant mocking awareness?&nbsp; what is my convergence?&nbsp; where will my skills join a valued need in the world so i know how, where and in what form to give. Catherine Deane Moore says, "Your calling is at the intersection of your joy and the earth's deepest need."&nbsp; where is my joy?&nbsp; what is Her deepest need?&nbsp;&nbsp; i'm investing in me because being the best me is the gift i can give the world today.&nbsp; my preferred self, me breaking inherited patterns, me taking flight.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">lifted from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anam_cara" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>:&nbsp;</span>
             <span style="background-color: white; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.1875px;">According to Celtic spiritual tradition, the soul shines all around the body like a luminous cloud. When you are very open, appreciative, and trusting with another person, your two souls flow together. This deeply felt bond with another person means you have found your anam cara, or "Soul Friend." Your anam cara always beholds your light and beauty, and accepts you for who you truly are. In Celtic spirituality, the anam cara friendship awakens the fullness and mystery of your life. You are joined in an ancient and eternal union with humanity that cuts across all barriers of time, convention, philosophy, and definition. When you are blessed with an anam cara, the Irish believe, you have arrived at that most sacred place: home.</span>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;">so a fabulous mr. john donohue wrote a book called Anam Cara, in which he offers wisdom and insight on the themes of love, friendship, solitude and death. &nbsp;</span></span>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;">and i have not been able to help myself, while reading his words on friendship between two souls, to take notes, in my own way, twisting and turning the reading to make sense for me and my personal journey.</span></span>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;">one of the deepest longings of the human soul is the desire to be seen and to belong. i want that. but more so, i long to truly see myself and belong to myself again, to remember myself, since my ability to do so was greatly compromised. &nbsp; one of the horrid after effects of developmental trauma and childhood wounding is that we often can no longer grasp our potential. our potential was seemingly snuffed out. well, i for one can no longer hand my power over to the people who hurt me, letting their maniacal acts rule my life forever. fuck them. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;">but what of it when we FINALLY sense a deeply felt bond with OURSELVES? &nbsp;when we finally come to love and accept ourselves enough that there is a deep ancient recognition? &nbsp;if friendship is always an act of recognition then is befriending ones self an act of self-recognition? can self-love be manufactured or achieved by an act of will or remembrance? what does it take to enter into&nbsp;friendship&nbsp;with ones self and if that can happen do we recognize our selves? &nbsp;our souls? &nbsp;who do we become? our own soul friend?</span></span>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;">it fascinates me to no end to consider that deep, true, hard won friendship with oneself comes with self-recognition. &nbsp;that it comes with self-love and self-acceptance. when we accept and discover ourselves, the ancient recognition settles in.</span></span>
            </div> 
            <div style="text-align: center;"> 
             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;">perhaps we used to love ourselves, before the childhood trauma and post traumatic stress brought the division and separation of liking, knowing, loving and accepting ourselves. after adverse childhood&nbsp;experiences our (secret) memory mourned the loss of us, without us even realizing it...for a while. &nbsp;some of us have wandered for years, the longing to love&nbsp;ourselves&nbsp;and accept ourselves barely recognizable, sometimes masked by obsession, compulsion, addiction, sabotage. for some of us the desire to belong to&nbsp;ourselves&nbsp;was not all together forgotten but faded to the dimmest random flicker.&nbsp;</span></span>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><span style="line-height: 19.1875px;">i think it must be in doing our work, deep soul diving into the truths of ourselves, letting go of the past, healing, tracking our time spent doing what's most important to us individually, making-to-mend, and reclaiming the power we have to mold our lives, shine our souls, and live in joy, that the tides begin to turn and we can consider leaning into self-love and self-acceptance. &nbsp;in loving ourselves an ancient circle closes. &nbsp;that which is ancient within us, when&nbsp;recognized&nbsp;and accepted, will tend us, protect us, shelter us and hold us together. &nbsp;when we fall in love with ourselves we come out of the&nbsp;loneliness&nbsp;of exile, of self-loathing, of shame and&nbsp;unworthiness&nbsp;to find home and belonging within ourselves. &nbsp;it is here where we can begin to&nbsp;consider&nbsp;cloaking ourselves in our own&nbsp;friendship&nbsp;and&nbsp;self-recognition. &nbsp;where we begin to belong to ourselves. &nbsp;we decide what we want, who we want to be, how we will get what we want, do what we want, live like we want.&nbsp;</span></span>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">she clutched the lustrous gleaming red apple in her hand. &nbsp;the sanguine orb trundled finger tips to palm as she spoke. &nbsp;and before I could inquire about the masses of blood-red spheres, she devotedly clasped her athame, dividing that suffused ruby-red ball perfectly to reveal the star. &nbsp;do you know of this? Are you privy? if you slice an apple in half, just right, it will gift you with the star symbol, precisely in its center, its belly, where the seeds live. &nbsp;i was in awe. &nbsp;i was jejune. &nbsp;I was 11. &nbsp;and she was the most magical, mystical, and enchanted person i could ever imagine containing and including in my lackluster life. &nbsp;she was my cousin. &nbsp;my seven years older companion. my dad's sister's daughter. &nbsp;and i was genuinely in love with her.</span>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">the alluring red apples were ubiquitous on that visit. &nbsp;she had them all around her room, &nbsp;in every quarter of the basement cave in that old gorgeous house in Wallingford. &nbsp;and we were continuously left to our own devices there in that deep, cozy underground hollow. &nbsp;it was a safe and bewitched space. &nbsp;and i was privileged enough to be permitted in. &nbsp;and there was shimmering candle light, &nbsp;lots of luminescent candle light. &nbsp;and hazy incense, &nbsp;one after another with the enticing smoky incense. i asked her why red and not green with the apples. &nbsp;and she said red, always red, never green. &nbsp;she spoke to me of the symbolism of apples: &nbsp;love, youth, beauty, happiness and immortality. &nbsp;she whispered dreamily of the isle of avalon being apple island. and she made sure i understood that our scandinavian roots, being nielsen's and all, were bound to the legends of our scandinavian gods and goddesses, in the other world, who were fed an apple, the life-giving fruit, every evening by the guardian goddess Iduna, &nbsp;the goddess of spring and youth, who nurtures an apple orchard in Asgard. &nbsp;it was all about magic, mystery, the mystical, and the sacred. &nbsp;my witchy cousin was ensuring that i too would be passed the gift of understanding symbolic meaning, gaining the ability to use herbs and potions to heal, and have knowledge of our pagan roots that informed our quasi-catholic upbringing. &nbsp;she was initiating me.</span>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">the apples are just one of my first significant memories surrounding this idol of mine, my cousin, my sister. &nbsp;she was just enough older than me that she had a "real" job, first at rainier bank, and then whatever it morphed into, when i was still quite impressionable. &nbsp;i was open and she was willing so i was bestowed her imprint and i lavished in it. &nbsp;in those glory days the money flowed like liquid gold and she had a no holds barred attitude where i was concerned. &nbsp;especially when it came to supplying her agreeable petite apprentice with paraphernalia, tools, essentials on the journey into teenagedome and becoming a free thinking iconoclast. &nbsp;this is how she justified her untethered spending on me: it was crucial to her that i was schooled, prepared, and developed within a certain elemental specific spiritual framework to make it thru the coming passage with as much room for growth and gaining knowledge and as little pain and agony as possible in my juvenile years. &nbsp;it was of the utmost importance to her that i knew i was enough, that i understood the long line of strong creative women i came from, and that i trusted she was there to have my back in case i faltered. &nbsp;she could not completely insulate me, by a long shot, but she gave me the securest cushiony landing spot and room to flail. &nbsp;she held the space for my breakdowns and dissonance during my teen years in a way that supported and didn’t stifle. she was present and alert.</span>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">my ambitious mom divorced and left my sad dad by the time i was four. &nbsp;pa stayed in windy, dusty ellensburg, where my 18 month younger brother and i were born, while my determined mom relocated us to the west side. &nbsp;my temporarily heartbroken dad was a firefighter and had an irregular schedule. &nbsp;my parents agreement was that dad would have us once a month. &nbsp;it fuckin sucked. &nbsp;it was hard and harsh. &nbsp;And we missed him like crazy. &nbsp;but when he finally showed up each month, it was like christmas morning, a celebration, a festival of love, longing, and reunion. &nbsp;it was the best and we unquestionably endured our separation from him hungering for reunification. &nbsp;and since he came over snoqualamie pass to retrieve us, we would most often spend the weekend with our grandparents in renton, instead of heading back over the cascades to ellensburg. &nbsp;looking back now, my folks being separated and having been afforded a weekend nearly every month with my paternal grandparents, was one of the utmost gifts of my childhood and my parents’ split. &nbsp;A hankered for blessing in disguise. basking in the ecstatic love and adoration of my grandma, in person, once a moon cycle, jam-packed me up with the love i craved and ached for and wasn’t getting elsewhere, namely from my distracted mom, whose attention was laser focused on her fresh rebound husband, while his attention, in turn, was laser focused on me. &nbsp;but that tale of preoccupation is an account for another time. &nbsp;and so, occasionally, instead of shacking up with my beloved and darling grandparents, we would hightail it across the 520 bridge, venturing into the big, bright, bustling city toward my dad’s sisters, and stay, at first on palentine, and then on latona, with my aunt, uncle and cousin, in seattle. &nbsp;it was on those rare weekends, in the early years, that i was sanctified by my cousin and aunt's devotion, love and pandering. &nbsp;it was these too far and few between journeys that my cousin would entice me subterranean to her chamber to be marinated in her glow, sequestered, in secret, the outer world shut out and time standing still. it was entering another world entirely and it was profound.</span>

            <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"> 
             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">from time to time, and especially as i did actually near my teens, the older adults would "allow" my cousin and i to venture off into the heart of the mysterious city on our own. &nbsp;she, of course, had been roaming, carousing, and taking seattle by storm since her very early years but for me to be allowed to go out with her, walking long distances or taking the city bus, since she didn’t drive, was a big deal. &nbsp;through the years, and once i could drive into the city myself, we had several spots that i call the "usual haunts" on our route. &nbsp;when i would get to her house each time, whether when i was much younger with my dad in tow, or a little older and on my own, she would have some variety of multi-layered gift for me and some portion of the gift was always an indulgent wad of cold hard cash meant to be spent on particular items in specific locales. &nbsp;often the other components of the gift were small indicators as to the wondrous places she would take me by the hand to discover. &nbsp;there was always music, incense, herbs, crystals, vintage trinkets, clothes and jewelry . &nbsp;all riches to my naïve, rural, bugged out eyes. &nbsp;for me they were otherworldly treasures, not the kind of stuff you could acquire or procure in the suburbs. &nbsp;once gifted my supernatural loot, we were off to peruse the brick and mortars ourselves so i could see, feel, pick, choose, and buy, with her endowment of funds, more of the same. &nbsp;it was a veiled dream come true and i lived, really longingly and anticipatorily existed, to fulfill my burgeoning wanderlust in her sorority.</span>

            <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"> 
             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">one of our usual haunts was tower records, in the mid-80s still a block off mercer street, and quite near my uncles offices at seattle center. &nbsp;it was actual records we were after, back in the day, albums, not cassettes, and cds weren’t even available yet. &nbsp;she knew I scarcely possessed any music but there I was, trailing behind in her herbalicious fragrant wake, as she called out, do you have this? &nbsp;What about this? oh you must have this…you won’t make it thru without this. &nbsp;essentially and effectively the message came across loud and clear: you won’t endure the passage to enlightenment or survive your coming of age if you don’t listen up….literally. i just stared, wide-eyed, chin on the floor and gulped it all deep soul down. &nbsp;i couldn’t get enough. and so then there we hovered, with a mass of albums, her trying to decide which mound of lyrical poetry i MUST obtain that interval. &nbsp;there was the Stones (her fav), fleetwood mac, Janis Joplin, and the Doors. then later the indigo girls, REM, and U2. &nbsp;and there were many many more: &nbsp;punk, reggae, blues, indie, world, new wave, ethnic, alternative, jazz, cajun, rock a billy, etc, but the others were the most conspicuous. &nbsp;she and we would pick 3 or so for me and a few for her and off we’d fly to our next lair. &nbsp;i still have all my albums and then some and since my 3 guys bought me a new turntable a couple years ago, I get to listen to them. &nbsp;and it takes me back. &nbsp;deep soul down.</span>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">additional habitual sanctums we craved were zenith supply on roosevelt or tenzing momo in pike place market. &nbsp;back in the day these became our everyday, routine, normal, go to hamlets for crystals, pendants, wands, incense, candles, oils, books, herbs, and all things witchy, occult and esoteric. &nbsp;i was being steeped and brewed in the ancient wise woman path and yet I was none the wiser in that moment. &nbsp;i was squarely thrilled and awed by all she knew and her precious gift of instilling it on me. &nbsp;i remember specifically twice that she guided me in choosing crystal mineral and gemstone pendants for myself. &nbsp;one was a marbleized green malachite crystal set with a small fiery opal cabochon in the center and another was a dark stripey obsidian crystal with a midnight blue lapis cabochon in the center. &nbsp;I wore both of them religiously and I was the only schoolgirl in junior high who dared be so bold and untrendy. &nbsp;our favorite incense was night queen by primo. &nbsp;we would also get frankincense, patchouli, or amber once in a while, along with stalking up on whatever other occultist&nbsp;accoutrements&nbsp;we needed for the season at hand. &nbsp;now, if i smell any of the aromatic zephyrs we regularly consumed then, the scent memory is so durable it tugs me right back to that cherished and lusted archetypal age.</span>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">When I recount the spellbinding emporiums as becoming common for my cousin to expose me to, it is only in sheer contrast to our annual pilgrimage to seattle center, for the folklife festival. &nbsp;The other harbors grew inevitable and orthodox while still evoking giddy delight upon pursuing them. &nbsp;But folklife, when my uncle was the director of it for 16 years, was the yearly local holy grail of whimsical nonconformity, celebrated diversity, a musical, theatrical, performance tribe and wild circus clan descended and created a world all its own where we could get it all and have it all over one long provocative weekend. &nbsp;we lived for it, we dressed for it, we prepared for it and we became one with it. &nbsp;We would save our money for weeks and months to take possession of the fantastic worldly ethnic goods we had held our breaths 4 lengthy seasons for. There was much planning, prep, scrutinizing the schedule and dissecting which vendors were where. &nbsp;(as an aside, the only dreamy and bewitched vendor we were willing to drag our lazy asses out of bed for on the first day, and wait lined up early for outside the exhibition hall doors, was our very own duvall handcraft legend, the goddess paula strobel, whose dolls and enchantments were collected by us with sheer panic and hysteria! &nbsp;Imagine my frenzied delirium many years later after having moved here to discover paula worked in the bookstore. and boy howdy was she ever so humble and even embarrassed with all the feverish gushing I spewed upon realizing her in the dusty stacks. &nbsp;she has been ever so gracious and charitable in symbolically patting my eager head while my tail still wags in her presence all these years later.) but back to folklife. my cousin and aunt had taught me to love well and deeply great fancy feasts of food. &nbsp;real, fresh, made from scratch honest to goodness food, in all its varieties, colors, flavors and textures. &nbsp;i was used to government cheese and there wasn’t a brown packaged brick in sight. &nbsp;that said, the availability of diverse fare at folklife was staggering and gorge worthy, thus the poring over of the scheduled food vendors and thus we stuffed to bursting. &nbsp;and none of our moolah had to be spent acquiring this gastronomic bloating of our own gluttonous epicurean ways. &nbsp;which was just one more charmed&nbsp;home-run&nbsp;for these kin of mine I revered so severely. &nbsp;all we had to do was trot around the grounds with my uncle, the bigwig, the director of the festival, whenever we got hungry and he was offered food left and right, hand over fist, more than he could every put away himself. &nbsp;so there we were to take up the slack, help him out, and make sure he didn’t need to reject his vendor’s culinary advances. &nbsp;it was our pleasure to proffer this favor so he didn’t look rude. &nbsp;it was wholly fantastic for a girl who was raised on frozen cardboard pizzas, metallic canned veggies, and free public school lunches.&nbsp;</span>

             <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">so, without exception, i was nourished entirely and completely under the protection of my kinfolks. &nbsp;their generous tutelage allowed me to propagate, mature and ripen into my own as a young adult. i am the unconventional parent, the eccentric and eclectic woman, the redemptive partner due to their planting of seeds. I have chosen authenticity, braveness, vulnerability and imperfection as a lifestyle thanks to their initial tutoring. we aren’t all as close as we once were and lately i’ve been feelin like there is a massive jagged hole in my heart that only they can plug up. &nbsp;i want to curl up with them, hold their fleshy hands, whisper what they mean to me and ensure they comprehend that <b>i am me because of them</b>. &nbsp;i want to them to know. &nbsp;i hope they know.</span>

All the untended wounds

Those hieroglyphs of pain

Carved into my skin and bones, -
Those coded messages

That send me down

The wrong street

The old wounds

The old misdirections

And I lift them -
One by one

Close to my heart

5. Stacks of library books: tiny houses, Beowulf, cookbooks, India, esoteric herbalism, trauma recovery/integration, Gabor Maté, Esther Perel. Come rain, come, I need an excuse to stay in between the sheets and read for days.

1. You are everywhere and nowhere and here was this electric blue stellar feather right on our path on the way to the elusive waterfalls. Thank you sis, @umberdove - always listening, watching and waiting for you, babe. 
2. Ozark Stout Ale Mustard on all the things, Wildbelly Sourdough Bread toasted and slathered with a megafuckton of butter, and salted dark chocolate dipped in fresh ground almond butter.... I may not know much, but I do know how to eat like a boss. 
3. Behind the scenes Fever Dream Collective sacred shenanigans in full swing and one by one our coven is growing, which thrills me to no end. 
4. Blood, ash, mascara, cum - it's been one of those weeks, honeybear. 
5. The eclipse, good goddess, what a dreamy, trippy, sublime, and strange endeavor to behold, plus the shake down and fall out of all the retrogrades - help me baby Jesus, help me.

1. You are everywhere and nowhere and here was this electric blue stellar feather right on our path on the way to the elusive waterfalls. Thank you sis, @umberdove - always listening, watching and waiting for you, babe. 
2. Ozark Stout Ale Mustard on all the things, Wildbelly Sourdough Bread toasted and slathered with a megafuckton of butter, and salted dark chocolate dipped in fresh ground almond butter.... I may not know much, but I do know how to eat like a boss. 
3. Behind the scenes Fever Dream Collective sacred shenanigans in full swing and one by one our coven is growing, which thrills me to no end. 
4. Blood, ash, mascara, cum - it's been one of those weeks, honeybear. 
5. The eclipse, good goddess, what a dreamy, trippy, sublime, and strange endeavor to behold, plus the shake down and fall out of all the retrogrades - help me baby Jesus, help me.

These ladies get it done. 
If you're not on @jennette.nielsen's mailing list, you're missing out on handmade clay rattles and cauldron mugs, and hearing about her coven of witches gathering in Sonoma next April with @alisha_sommer. The lady's got mad style and has been making good magic with the plants and earth a long while. You must smell her Magia Bruja Spritzer. If she's out, beg her to make more, she'll do it.
She's seasoned and still wild as can be.
At her hip is @jen_gray who mothers a lot of us wild maniacs with her tough love support, loyalty, wicked humor and good sense.

After 23 years, it's complete, the contract is dissolved and I begin again, as usual, always the beginner, and happy to do so, leaning in and feeling all the juxtaposed, contradictory and duplicitous feels, deeply, the holy ache and cavernous joy, the exquisite sorrow of loss and regret and heralding freedom with pulsing amplified pleasures, the rollercoaster grief and a nervous system wanting to settle, all the feels, poignantly, specifically, yesterday, today, tomorrow and the next day, and so on, life tugging at me, stay woke, take the next right step, then another, but go slow, notice, pay attention, lay on Mother Earth, offer Her your dirty bundle of troubles and treasures, that you've kept gathered in an ol' bandana tied to the end of a found stick, like a vagabond hobo this last long while, and  breathe witch, breathe, you got this, you're gonna be ok, keep going. -

Note to self: I behold you, beautiful one, I behold you child of the Earth and Sun, let my love watch over you, let my love wash over you.

After 23 years, it's complete, the contract is dissolved and I begin again, as usual, always the beginner, and happy to do so, leaning in and feeling all the juxtaposed, contradictory and duplicitous feels, deeply, the holy ache and cavernous joy, the exquisite sorrow of loss and regret and heralding freedom with pulsing amplified pleasures, the rollercoaster grief and a nervous system wanting to settle, all the feels, poignantly, specifically, yesterday, today, tomorrow and the next day, and so on, life tugging at me, stay woke, take the next right step, then another, but go slow, notice, pay attention, lay on Mother Earth, offer Her your dirty bundle of troubles and treasures, that you've kept gathered in an ol' bandana tied to the end of a found stick, like a vagabond hobo this last long while, and  breathe witch, breathe, you got this, you're gonna be ok, keep going. -

Note to self: I behold you, beautiful one, I behold you child of the Earth and Sun, let my love watch over you, let my love wash over you.

What a glorious restorative and deeply healing week of being cocooned in the #soulodgeranch magic portal with beautiful women. The singing, the fire, the #Solstice, the sun, the food, the land, the women, oh, the women. Just fucking epic. 
Gathering with women in creative/spiritual pursuit is where it's at, sisters.

We are giving you plenty of time to plan but don't wait too long as spots are filling.
