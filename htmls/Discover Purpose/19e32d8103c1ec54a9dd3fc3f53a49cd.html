       <p>Today we are dealing with a major deficiency in our culture.</p> 
       <p>Sure weâre dealing with an epidemic of nutritional deficienciesâ¦ but there is an even bigger deficiency Iâm talking about.</p> 
       <p>Itâs a deficiency in knowing our purpose.</p> 
       <p>Statistically, people who know who they are and live with a sense of purpose outlive everyone else in the population.</p> 
       <p>Not only that, they experience far fewer chronic illnesses, far less memory loss, and more happiness in life overall.</p> 
       <p>It kind of makes sense when you think about it. Your mind and body really work on a âuse it or lose it basisâ. And if you are not inspired to use your body and mental faculties each day, why on earth would they be compelled to stick around?</p> 
       <p>Your purpose is literally tied to your lifeline. And today is the day to get fully connected with who you are, why youâre here, and what youâre all about.<span id="more-6124"></span></p> 
       <p>Todayâs show is loaded with insights to help you reveal what Paulo Coelho would call your own âpersonal legendâ.</p> 
       <p>Thereâs actually a formula for uncovering your lifeâs purpose. Itâs incredibly simple, but itâs only applicable if youâre ready for it.</p> 
       <p>So, if youâre ready, click play, listen with your heart, and take action on the exercises. Letâs go!</p> 
       <h2>In this episode youâll discover:</h2> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Why you actually get to choose what your brain is made of.</li> 
        <li>How a sense of purpose impacts <strong>aging and development.</strong></li> 
        <li>How purpose means different things to different people.</li> 
        <li>Why having lots of choices can become <strong>debilitating</strong>.</li> 
        <li>What the <strong>formula</strong> for finding your purpose is.</li> 
        <li>Why failure can be a huge <strong>launching pad</strong> to uncovering your purpose.</li> 
        <li>What important questions to ask yourself in order to flesh out your purpose.</li>

         <p>Hi Shawn,<br> Just listen to your latest podcast and it blew me away it was like you were talking directly to me ð</p> 
         <p>Iâm at stage in my life where Iâm filled with confusion and doubt.<br> To answer your question about what would I do every single day if I knew I couldnât fail at it, is to become a nutritional therapist. Iâd love to be able to get up every day and go into my own clinic where I know Iâm going to be helping people reach their health goals and help change their lives for the better.</p> 
         <p>Iâve already signed up to do a 3 year course in nutritional Thearpy and it starts in 4 weeks time and to tell you the truth Man Iâm fearful and scared, im scared that im not going to be able to learn the content of the course that im not passionate enough about the course and scared that Iâve always worked for someone else in my life and that il not be able to make a living , by living my purpose.</p> 
         <p>I wasnât the greatest student when I was at school and learning was never a strong point for me, and now Iâve given up my life in Australia to move back home to Ireland (and living in my friends attic) to pursue this new life and Iâm scared that Iâve made a mistake that I should just move back to Australia go back to my job in construction which involves sitting all day long in a machine which I donât like but it pays well, and it would keep my parents happy as they know Iâm earning a good living.</p> 
         <p>Is my purpose in life to work for other people in a job and career I donât like but pays me well or is it to step outside my comfort zone and try to do and be someone/something that Iâm not sure I can become???</p> 
         <p>I just want to say thanks for all that you do Iâm such a big fan of yours and seeing how you help others change their lives is one of the reasons for me looking to change my career.</p> 
         <p>Thanks<br> Declan</p>

           <p>Declan, I canât even put to words how remarkable this is. You have so many of the qualities that the greats have had in paving their own way in lifeâ¦ Confusion and doubt are two hallmark symptoms. Getting into another orbit can obviously be disorienting, but the thing about our hearts and minds is that they adjust. They will adjust to greatness or they will adjust to mediocrity.</p> 
           <p>Fear. Who said that fear wouldnât be a part of this? Tell me, anything youâve done that has had a significant impact in your life, wasnât fear always at least a little involved? Talking to the person you likeâ¦ going in for that job interviewâ¦ trying out for a group or teamâ¦ fear is always there. The greats just move forward anyway. If you donât have fear, then sometimes you can get a little TOO comfortable and not care enough.</p> 
           <p>A great person you need to be following on a regular basis is Lewis Howes. His story came immediately to mind in hearing your story. He will actually be on the show coming on in just a few weeks. Or you can check him out right here if you havenât already <a href="http://lewishowes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://lewishowes.com/</a> â If youâre going to do something great, and step outside of the norm, then you need to surround yourself with great people who have been there before to help keep you focused and guide you on the way. Thatâs one of the many reasons these podcasts are so powerful. Iâm a part of your life, Lewis is, and other great teachers who will, not only keep your mind right, but give you the tools and lessons weâve learned over the years as well. Also, study business and marketing if youâre going to make your career work. You can have minimal experience at helping people in nutrition, but if you know how to run it like a real business and really serve people, then you can make a real living <em>living</em> your dream.</p>

         <p>Shawn, </p> 
         <p>Thank you to you and your crew. You guys put up sensational content that people need. </p> 
         <p>This episode really spoke to me. I been on a hiatus in life. I seem to be stuck on trying to figure out what to do for my career/life purpose. I was set to become a fireman. But shortly after applying I got stage 4 cancer. I have been having this long going pain in my hip that would sometimes stop me from walking. This is where I put my career on hold for a couple of years. I am now in remission. I wish I didnât do chemo but I am fine now. I need to keep my good health and avoid all these unhealthy distractions they push on us. </p> 
         <p>But as of now I am trying to get back into school and become a fireman again. I just feel itâs makes it harder for a person to become a fireman who recently had cancer with so much people applying. I feel like why would a department want to hire someone who had cancer when they can hire someone who has not But after beating cancer I just feel like I have so much purpose that I want to help people and inspire them. Being a firefighter, I can help people and also inspire them that having cancer is only a phase in their life that you are doing something wrong and you need to reboot your body. I want to show people that things can be done. Especially help people during their hard times and emergencies. </p> 
         <p>I failed a few tests recently and it has dropped my drive to become a fireman. And it keeps me thinking âshould I try something else?â </p> 
         <p>But then again, being a fireman and beating cancer is a legacy I want to leave behind. I just need some willpower and keep my train moving forward. </p> 
         <p>And when you said that peopleâs happiness is what will give you success. I truly stand behind that. Because during my cancer process, seeing people cheer me on and be happy gave me a mindset that I will beat this cancer. It gave me the drive to inspire people that beating cancer can be done. </p> 
         <p>It seems that I already have my ideas and passion, I just need to make decisions. </p> 
         <p>I just want to say thank you. You are a blessing and the knowledge you give is the truth. I believe thatâs what separates you from others. You break everything down and get to the root of the problem. You definitely know your stuff and you even give the studies to back it. I appreciate you and your crew.<br> Thank you!</p>

           <p>Kevin, wow man, your story is extremely powerful! I appreciate the gratitude so much, but I want to extend my gratitude to you for having the heart, courage, and will to take back your lifeâ¦ and in the process I know that youâve gained a world of experience to share.</p> 
           <p>Not only should you continue towards your mission of becoming a fireman, but this sounds like an absolutely phenomenal idea for a documentary to follow your process. I know a lot of people would be inspired to see videos of this, or to hear your story on the news. The cancer wasnât a disadvantage, itâs given you the greatest leverage toward achieving your goals that you ever could have. </p> 
           <p>Looking forward to hearing the update on your story real soon my friend!</p>

         <p>Shawn! The show really opened opened my eyes, my heart and more importantly my mind today. I canât wait to put these steps into use to figure out what i was put on this earth for. Lately it has been really hard and I have been struggling at finding my âhappyâ but after today I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that It will click for me. I am so thankful for you and Jade for putting on such a great show that I get to look forward to every single week.

         <p>Hey Sean. I am a longtime listener and I have been looking at what I am passionate about for the last couple years. Action is the biggest thing I have been missing and over the last few months I have been taking steps to make my dream a reality. I appreciate your show today and the decision part is really key for me, and it is adding fuel to the fire to make it happen. If you have a minute I would love your opinion.</p> 
         <p>I think research is critical to our understanding of health, and I think there is a problem with the way research is funded today. Researchers are reliant on government, industry and charities for funding, but the government does not have enough money to give to all possible research. Industry is only interested in research that benefits them, even if the study was biased to support them. They do not give to research that will show their product harmful or less effective than something else. I donât see big pharma spending money on research to show changing diet can help people get off of heart meds, diabetes meds, prevent and heal diseases, a la Dr Terry Wahls for instance. And charities can have quite a large overhead where a significant amount if not a mojority of money raised goes towards sustaining the charity, not in research and treatment. </p> 
         <p>I want to change this! I want to democratize research and let people choose how their money should be spent, and what research is important to them. Americans spend over $330 Billion in charitable donations every year. I would like even a small fraction of that to be done on a platform where people choose what is important to them, and as much money as possible goes straight into that research. </p> 
         <p>Crowd funding is the best way to do this that I can see, and I would like it to be a platform that issues tax receipts for the donations. There are many charitable crowdfunding platforms, but there is not one dedicated to research. </p> 
         <p>If we want to really get to the bottom of cancer for example, I donât think drug companies are going to to find the answer, no matter how much they spend. I believe Diet and lifestyle are the key, but a complete understanding of how does not yet exist. </p> 
         <p>I see this becoming a huge way to make an impact on the world, and that we will look back and wonder how this never existed. Like the Internet. </p> 
         <p>I believe this is inevitable but I am tired of waiting, so I am doing something about it. </p> 
         <p>I would love your feedback and would love to hear from you. Do you want to have a hand in not only making this possible, but shaping it? </p> 
         <p>I appreciate all you have done Shawn, and I thank you for helping me to get on the road to healing myself. </p> 
         <p>Keep up the great work!</p>

           <p>Devin, Devin, Devinâ¦ wow, this is so powerful. I think itâs an absolutely brilliant thing to devote your time to. Iâve come to the realization long ago that the real science/studies are going to be funded by the public, not a government entity. As much as Iâd like that to change, the power is inevitably in the hands of the people (whether we realize it or not).</p> 
           <p>When you make some ground on bringing this vision to reality, definitely keep me in the loop!</p>

         <p>Wow thank you so much for a fantastic podcast Shawn, as always a truly inspirational message! Iâm at a real crossroads in my life, I donât know what my purpose is and have lost direction completely through the loss of my beloved brother two years ago. He was someone who was so true to himself and to others but who only really found his purpose later on in life where he was a true inspiration and source of fun and joy to the special needs kids he looked after. I donât know what my future will hold but your podcast has given me the encouragement to live like my brother bringing only fun and love to other peopleâs lives. Thank you!</p>

         <p>Shawn daddeh! Love it love it love it, brother! My fiance and I have very in-depth conversations often about your show topics and the power you have to make someone listen, and truly absorb what you are bringing to the table. In a way, youâve brought the two of us together, stronger and more open to receive what the other has to offer or what they donât and find it anyway ð<br> When I was listening to the latest episode, just about an hour ago, I got even more attentive when you told us to come on here and deliver our purpose. For me, I immediately got jittery trying to think of how in the world I would approach what I thought would be an impossible thing for me to do, and something I even tried to talk myself out of. However, I couldnât get home fast enough to hop on here and just start typing!<br> Within the last year youâve helped me discover what I know to truly be my purpose in this incarnate. Iâve never felt such an urge and legit yearning to a.) countinue learning as much as I can and b.) to then take that knowledge and live a passionate and helpful life of service to and for anyone that I may be of any assistance to. In the past I lived a life that I havenât been very thrilled about in my more recent adult years; taking people and objects for granted, living a selfish lifestyle with no selfless action to be thought of.. But! I accept the fact that thatâs what happened and to now live a life of service and selfless action is a very helpful way to not keep turning the karmic wheel so fast! The great Indian saint Neem Karoli Baba, Maharaj-ji said to one of his devotees when asked how to find God or come into contact with God, âfeed people, serve peopleâ he said. As Krishna Das puts it,he was furious at the response at first and thought it was insane but, knew later where he was going with the response. When Krishna Das told that story my heart was immediatley pierced with conviction yet, also love. Iâve taken that to heart, Shawn. And with your powerful, POWERFUL messages and ways of presenting them, you are serving me and I thank you for that. In return my heart is open to the world and I feel I could never give enough.<br> Thank you Shawn for everything youâve done for me, my path and my family, which she is also a huge fan of you and Jade! ð<br> Youâve empowered me and given me hope. Thank you again!</p> 
         <p>P.S. You, Evan Brand, Ben Greenfield, and Aubrey Marcus are my 4Horsemen of podcasting!!</p>

           <p>Nicholas, what can I say. This message affirms MY purpose in so many ways. Truly, I could read what you wrote everyday. Thank you for sharing these words from the heart.</p> 
           <p>I love the anecdote as wellâ¦ so simple. Almost too simple for our wild minds lol. The path to fulfillment, from what Iâve seen, does come from service. The most amazing part is that service to others and the planet can come in many different ways. Our stories are so similar in that I was once (unknowingly) very self-centered. I had no idea that I was that wayâ¦ it wasnât until I lost so much that I realized what really mattered most. I wanted to BE love â to BE inspiration â to BE a model for whatâs possible and help people get there. I guess thatâs all come to pass, and Iâm just scratching the surface lol. I have amazing people like you who are ignited and helping to change the world right along with meâ¦ and thatâs more powerful than any dream I have ever imagined. </p> 
           <p>Much love and more greatness to come!<br> ~S</p>

         <p>Shawn, iâve listened to every one of your podcasts multiple times (including the good dad project!). Each week I look forward to Wednesday because I know a knew episode will be coming out. And each week, I wonder how you can keep coming up with new topics! Itâs amazing the work you do and how much you put in to each episode. YOU are the reason Iâm a nutrition major in college and pursuing my true purpose in life. Everything you say has such meaning and heart behind it and thatâs why you are one of my biggest idolsâ¦I came across your podcast several months ago and ever since, my life hasnât been the same. It has had an impact on me that I canât put into words. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, trulyâ¦Also, on a quick side note, I am a student at Penn State University and also a part of SNA (student nutrition association). We are looking for a guest speaker to come in March for National Nutrition Month. I wasnât sure how to contact you or the most formal way to do so. But, if you are interested in speaking at our university, I know hundreds of people would benefit from your words of wisdom. Thank you again for all that you do!</p>

         <p>Dear Shawn,<br> I am a freshmen in college and recently have been feeling extremely lost about where I want to go, and what I see myself doing in the future. I have been flipping back and forth with the idea of switching majors and have ended up feeling completely overwhelmed. I have tried to collect my thoughts and articulate them to my parents, college advisor, and even myselfâ¦but I couldnât seem to do so. I want to thank you deeply for publishing this show! I like to think it was some kind of signal from you, as though you could sense my struggles. I took notes on this show in my Chemistry Lab notebook, and it has truly has clarified my thoughts. I feel more inspired now than I did at the beginning of the semester. I may not be on the right path at this moment, but hearing your stories of switching majors in college, starting your own business, and your own mistakes has given me a sense of confidence. As always, thank you thank you thank you.<br> Much love,<br> Annie</p>

         <p>Shawn,<br> You and several others that I listen to on podcasts have convinced me that my purpose to my community, is to follow in your footsteps and continue to bring the good news of health and fitness and happiness and vitality to those that are suffering from obesity and disease and depression and sleeplessness etc. I am constantly sharing your podcasts and information onto my Facebook page which is Zumba &amp; fitness with Wren. Five days a week I teach fitness classes. When Iâm not doing that I am searching Dr. Google for information to share on Facebook so I can help others. </p> 
         <p>My question to you is how can I take this a step further? I enjoy public speaking and Iâve been contemplating how I can use that skill to reach more people. </p> 
         <p>Do you train apprentices? I was thinking of taking some of your podcast information and speaking to the ladies group at my church. But Iâm not a nurse or a doctor or a dietitian or even a personal trainer. My degree is in business computers. But my passion I have found, later in life, is helping others get fit and eat better and have an overall healthier lifestyle. Now I just need to figure out how to put that passion to work.</p>

         <p>As always, awesome podcast! My purpose in life is to create and build an environment of growth and unity for social change. Iâm in the stepping stones of my dreams. After 10 years of fear, I have finally given birth to YSuperstars. I truly have to say that your show has been my support group. It started with your book this July 2015. Godâs amazing time humbles me. Thank you. Shout out also to Shade, I love how you add value to Shawn! Your questions are powerful. Both of you are part of my mastermind group, in spirit. Love you both, yeah, I said it.</p>

         <p>Awesome show as usual, Shawn. Iâve listened to this one several times as I feel Iâm on a journey of not only exploring, but turning my purpose into reality. Iâm at a point of transition â still working a 9-5 job at the moment, but also doing personal training part time. I love helping people and have felt this was my ultimate purpose for some time now â I just didnât know how it would manifest itself.</p> 
         <p>As a personal trainer, I love helping others not only âreleaseâ their weight, but get more joy out of life by freeing themselves from the bondage of medicines and prescriptions, low self-esteem, etc. This is awesome, but I would love to have an even bigger impact as I realize there is only so much change that can be made in the gym. Ideally, Iâd like to coach people on all areas of health to help not only change their lives, but eventually change the world for the good. This I feel is my purpose, and I want to personally thank you â you are truly an inspiration and you and Jade have become a part of my daily routine. I look forward to your inspiring words that not only educate, but uplift and inspire me to really go after my dreams. It can be scary stepping out into a world away from what you know â my âcomfort zoneâ â but as you mentioned several times, by not growing my gifts and passions is selfish because Iâm essentially depriving someone else of the knowledge and encouragement that could completely change their life. So thank you again â youâve opened my mind and Iâm excited to go out and conquer the world, in a good way of course, lol. Continue to pray for me and my family and likewise I will pray for yours â be blessed.</p>

         <p>Howdy Rockstars, Shawn, &amp; Jade, </p> 
         <p>My purpose is to organize and plan bicycle tours of local farms, food and fermentation. The purpose RadTour Productions is to build a stronger constituency of local food advocate and folks that bicycle for transportation. I worked in advocacy previously but sitting in front of a computer wasnât my jam so I figured taking people out to small farms by bicycle sounded way more engaging, fun, impactful. Weâre up against a broken food system and an an obesity epidemic. Small sustainable farmers who grow real food and choosing to bike for short trips are a huge part of the solution. </p> 
         <p>Five years ago I started the Iowa City Culinary Ride. This year we had four rides in the Midwest with the main event bringing 250 folks together to bike 60 miles of pavement and gravel roads to farms, each paired with chefs serving up fresh, local cuisine. People end the ride empowered to live a little bit healthier lives and have killer time doing it. </p> 
         <p>Since finding your show two years ago you have helped to keep my purpose alive and given me faith that even if Iâm not making a living (yet!) doing bicycle farm tours, as long as I love what Iâm doing, itâs all good! As we move forward into the next five years and evolve you two will definitely be by my side. Ride on.</p> 
         <p>P.S. I am a massage therapist too and the #1 piece of health advice I give people is: take a walk and listen to the Model Health Show!</p>

         <p>Hi Shawn, I listen to you all the time and this episode was just as amazing as the others. I feel my purpose in life is very closely related to yours. I want to help individuals that have been diagnosis with illnesses that are said to be incurable. </p> 
         <p>I was diagnosed with Lupus back in 2003. I struggle all though high school and college with my health and trying to live a regular life. I was always in and out of hospitals. At one point I was taking 20 pills a day. I always felt horrible because the medications only numbed me or made me sicker.</p> 
         <p>While in college I discovered plant-based eating. I was willing to try anything because I was tired of the doctors not even knowing what was wrong with me. So I started off with a vegetarian diet. </p> 
         <p>Itâs been 2 years since Iâve been vegan and as of Jan 2015 Iâm completely off all medication. I now want to share my story with others like myself. Teaching the benefits of a natural lifestyle. </p> 
         <p>Thank you for sharing</p>

         <p>I love your show! I just recently started listening to it. Before I started listening to it, a few weeks ago I discovered my purpose and just so passionate and excited to share it with the world. I am already passionate and excited about the impact I am having on others, but your show really helps me to keep having high energy and learn new content with health and wellness as well.<br> I believe everyone has a definite purpose to their life. Mine is to help others discover their true self through moving through there fears with confidence and passion, and stepping to their greatness unapologetically.

         <p>Shawn, Thank you so much for sharing this show. I took so many notes and I will put into practice (I started typing hope â but realized thereâs wiggle room in the word hope â I decided there is not other option). Iâm 33 years old and since the beginning of this year Iâve been struggling with the idea of what is my passion as I trek to my job everyday. This show has allowed me to clear my thoughts and eyes and find that vision.</p> 
         <p>Thank you to you and Jade for another awesome show. Well done guys.</p>

         <p>Hi Shawn and Jade,</p> 
         <p>I have slowly been working my way through all of your shows. Today I listened to this one and as always it blew me away. I have read books on finding your purpose but none resonated with me as much as how you explained everything. I love how simple your words are and how I feel like they can be lived and attained. I have a similar story to you in that I battled unexplained health issues for years (started with degenerative disc disease) finally being diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis and Iritis. I have always been interested in health and fitness but after my diagnosis I was determined to avoid conventional medicine as much as possible. A little over two years ago I joined Instagram and immediately realized the power of connection and healing through social media. It sounds crazy but there is a huge autoimmune disease community and I truly feel we are all there for each other. I have found great strength in connection. I made it my goal to start a blog so that I could share my story and inform those suffering from an autoimmune condition that there are other options. I have connected with more people than I can count and even though it can be difficult to juggle a full time job, a blog, raising a 3 year old son, being there for my husband and friends nothing feels better then knowing I am making a difference. I would love to devote more to my blog and what I am doing. I keep freezing up whenever I want to give more. I donât know why I keep holding back. Thank you for the inspiration today! I plan to do something with it. And, by the way. I grew up in St. Louis! Itâs an amazing city who is lucky to have both of you doing the work you are doing.</p> 
         <p>Sincerely,<br> Katie</p>
