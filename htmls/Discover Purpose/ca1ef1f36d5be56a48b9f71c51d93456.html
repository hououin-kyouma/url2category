      <a name="A"> Be loyal to what you love, be true to the earth, fight your enemies with passion and laughter. <br><b> Edward Abbey </b></a>
      <br>
      <br> You can't study the darkness by flooding it with light. 
      <br>
      <b> Edward Abbey </b>
      <br>
      <br> If you have come to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together. 
      <br>
      <b> Aboriginal Activists Group, Queensland </b>
      <br>
      <br> No one ever succeeds without the help of others. 
      <br>
      <b> Jay Abraham </b>
      <br>
      <br> Let sorrowful longing dwell in your heart. Never give up, never lose hope. 
      <br>
      <b> Sheikh Abū-Sa'īd Abul-Khayr </b>
      <br>
      <br> We become more successful when we are happier and more positive. 
      <br>
      <b> Shawn Achor </b>
      <br>
      <br> Shaped a little like a loaf of French country bread, our brain is a crowded chemistry lab, bustling with nonstop neural conversations. 
      <br>
      <b> Diane Ackerman </b>
      <br>
      <br> Touch seems to be as essential as sunlight. 
      <br>
      <b> Diane Ackerman </b>
      <br>
      <br> Play is our brain's favorite way of learning. 
      <br>
      <b> Dianne Ackerman </b>
      <br>
      <br> Life is your art. An open, aware heart is your camera. A oneness with your world is your film. Your bright eyes, your easy smile is your museum. 
      <br>
      <b> Ansel Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> No man has the right to dictate what other men should perceive, create or produce, but all should be encouraged to reveal themselves, their perceptions and emotions, and to build confidence in the creative spirit. 
      <br>
      <b> Ansel Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept. 
      <br>
      <b> Ansel Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> There is little sense in attempting to change external conditions, you must first change inner beliefs, then outer conditions will change accordingly. 
      <br>
      <b> Brian Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> Encouragement is the oxygen of the soul. 
      <br>
      <b> George M. Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> Fortify yourself with a flock of friends! There is always at least one who will understand, inspire, and give you the lift you may need at the time. 
      <br>
      <b> George M. Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> He who praises another enriches himself far more than he does the one praised. To praise is an investment in happiness. The poorest human being has something to give that the richest could not buy. 
      <br>
      <b> George M. Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> If it's free, it's advice, if you pay for it, it's counseling; if you can use either one, it's a miracle. 
      <br>
      <b> Jack Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader. 
      <br>
      <b> John Quincy Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. 
      <br>
      <b> John Quincy Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> Nature tops the list of potent tranquilizers and stress reducers. The mere sound of moving water has been shown to lower blood pressure. 
      <br>
      <b> Patch Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> Spread joy. Chase your wildest dreams. 
      <br>
      <b> Patch Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> He sendeth sun, he sendeth shower, alike they're needed to the flower; and joys and tears alike are sent to give the soul its nourishment. 
      <br>
      <b> Sarah Flower Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> Remember there's no such thing as a small act of kindness. 
      <br>
      <b> Scott Adams </b>
      <br>
      <br> Action indeed is the sole medium of expressing for ethics. 
      <br>
      <b> Jane Addams </b>
      <br>
      <br> The most sacred place dwells within our heart, where dreams are born and secrets sleep, a mystical refuge of darkness and light, fear and conquest, adventure and discovery, challenge and transformation. Our heart speaks for our soul every moment while we are alive. Listen... as the whispering beat repeats: be...gin, be...gin, be...gin. It's really that simple. Just begin... again. 
      <br>
      <b> Royce Addington </b>
      <br>
      <br> There is a well of infinity hidden within each Soul. There you will find an incredible energy source, beyond your broadest understanding. It is Light and Healing. The Force of Nature. The essence of Love. 
      <br>
      <b> Royce Addington </b>
      <br>
      <br> A cloudy day or a little sunshine have as great an influence on many constitutions as the most recent blessings or misfortunes. 
      <br>
      <b> Joseph Addison </b>
      <br>
      <br> A contented mind is the greatest blessing a man can enjoy in this world. 
      <br>
      <b> Joseph Addison </b>
      <br>
      <br> Reading is a basic tool in living of a good life. 
      <br>
      <b> Joseph Addison </b>
      <br>
      <br> Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body. 
      <br>
      <b> Joseph Addison </b>
      <br>
      <br> The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for. 
      <br>
      <b> Joseph Addison </b>
      <br>
      <br> What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. 
      <br>
      <b> Joseph Addison </b>
      <br>
      <br> The chief danger in life is that you may take too many precautions. 
      <br>
      <b> Alfred Adler </b>
      <br>
      <br> The only normal people are the ones you don't know very well. 
      <br>
      <b> Alfred Adler </b>
      <br>
      <br> Trust only movement. Life happens at the level of events, not of words. 
      <br>
      <b> Alfred Adler </b>
      <br>
      <br> Our prayers are answered not when we are given what we ask, but when we are challenged to be what we can be. 
      <br>
      <b> Morris Adler </b>
      <br>
      <br> There is no pain so great as the memory of joy in present grief. 
      <br>
      <b> Aeschylus </b>
      <br>
      <br> Gratitude is the sign of noble souls. 
      <br>
      <b> Aesop </b>
      <br>
      <br> No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. 
      <br>
      <b> Aesop </b>
      <br>
      <br> As you begin to pay attention to your own stories and what they say about you, you will enter into the exciting process of becoming, as you should be, the author of your own life, the creator of your own possibilities. 
      <br>
      <b> Mandy Aftel </b>
      <br>
      <br> Dreams are free, so free your dreams. 
      <br>
      <b> Astrid Alauda </b>
      <br>
      <br> The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning. 
      <br>
      <b> Mitch Albom </b>
      <br>
      <br> There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. 
      <br>
      <b> Madeleine K. Albright </b>
      <br>
      <br> Far away there in the sunshine are my highest aspirations. I may not reach them, but I can look up and see their beauty, believe in them, and try to follow where they lead. 
      <br>
      <b> Louisa May Alcott </b>
      <br>
      <br> Be brave enough to live life creatively. The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. You can't get there by bus, only by hard work and risk and by not quite knowing what you are doing. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover will be yourself. 
      <br>
      <b> Alan Alda </b>
      <br>
      <br> There is not enough darkness in all the world to put out the light of even one small candle. 
      <br>
      <b> Robert Alden </b>
      <br>
      <br> When you give yourself permission to communicate what matters in every situation you will have peace despite rejection or disapproval. Putting a voice to your sour helps you to let go of the negative energy of fear and regret. 
      <br>
      <b> Shannon L. Alder </b>
      <br>
      <br> There are two kinds of writers: those that make you think, and those that make you wonder. 
      <br>
      <b> Brian Aldiss </b>
      <br>
      <br> We learn more by looking for the answer to a question and not finding it than we do from learning the answer itself. 
      <br>
      <b> Lloyd Alexander </b>
      <br>
      <br> The man who has no imagination has no wings. 
      <br>
      <b> Mohammad Ali </b>
      <br>
      <br> Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. 
      <br>
      <b> Mohammad Ali </b>
      <br>
      <br> It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out, it's the pebble in your shoe. 
      <br>
      <b> Muhammad Ali </b>
      <br>
      <br> Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. 
      <br>
      <b> Muhammad Ali </b>
      <br>
      <br> If they can make penicillin out of moldy bread, they can sure make something out of you. 
      <br>
      <b> Muhammad Ali </b>
      <br>
      <br> Remember that you are needed. There is at least one important work to be done that will not be done unless you do it. 
      <br>
      <b> Charles Allen </b>
      <br>

      <br>
      <b> Fred Allen </b>
      <br>
      <br> All that man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts. 
      <br>
      <b> James Allen </b>
      <br>
      <br> Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so you shall become. 
      <br>
      <b> James Allen </b>
      <br>
      <br> Failures are steps in the ladder of success. 
      <br>

Each unveils the best part of the other. No matter what else goes wrong around us, with that one person we're safe in our own paradise. Our soulmate is someone who shares our deepest longings, our sense of direction. When we're two balloons, and together our direction is up, chances are we've found the right person. Our soulmate is the one who makes life come to life.

      <br>
      <br> Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it.

      <br> The master of the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation, his love and his religion. He hardly knows which is which; he simply pursues his vision of excellence in whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him he is always doing both.

      <b> Buddha </b>
      <br>
      <br> There is nothing more dreadful than the habit of doubt. Doubt separates people. It is a poison that disintegrates friendships and breaks up pleasant relations. It is a thorn that irritates and hurts; it is a sword that kills.

      <b> Buddha </b>
      <br>
      <br> To enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one's family, to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control one's own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him.

Through a lifetime of personal practice, human beings are capable of revealing all of the secrets of the cosmic essence. You are your own best judge.

      <br> A loving relationship is one in which the loved one is free to be himself – to laugh with me, but never at me; to cry with me, but never because of me; to love life, to love himself, to love being loved. Such a relationship is based upon freedom and can never grow in a jealous heart.

      <br> We don't always know what makes us happy. We know, instead, what we think SHOULD. We are baffled and confused when our attempts at happiness fail…We are mute when it comes to naming accurately our own preferences, delights, gifts, talents.

      <br> I think a person who takes a job in order to live - that is to say, for the money - has turned himself into a slave. Work begins when you don't like what you're doing.

      <br> A smile is nature's best antidote for discouragement. It brings rest to the weary, sunshine to those who are frowning, and hope to those who are hopeless and defeated. A smile is so valuable that it can't be bought, begged, borrowed, or taken away against your will. You have to be willing to give a smile away before it can do anyone else any good. So if someone is too tired or grumpy to flash you a smile, let him have one of yours anyway. Nobody needs a smile as much as the person who has none to give.

We teach them that two and two make four, and that Paris is the capital of France. When will we also teach them what they are? We should say to each of them: Do you know what you are? You are a marvel. You are unique. In all the years that have passed, there has never been another child like you. Your legs, your arms, your clever fingers, the way you move. You may become a Shakespeare, a Michelangelo, a Beethoven. You have the capacity for anything. Yes, you are a marvel. And when you grow up, can you then harm another who is, like you, a marvel?

      <br> As long as we're caught up in always looking for certainty and happiness, rather than honoring the taste and smell and quality of exactly what is happening, as long as we're always running from discomfort, we're going to be caught in a cycle of unhappiness and discomfort, and we will feel weaker and weaker. This way of seeing helps us develop inner strength. And what's especially encouraging is the view that inner strength is available to us at just the moment when we think that we've hit the bottom, when things are at their worst.

The first symptom is that you stop worrying. Things don't bother you anymore. You become light hearted and full of joy. The second symptom is that you encounter more and more meaningful coincidences in your life, more and more synchronicities.

      <br> If you have good wealth mentality.... you will generate wealth wherever you go. Even if you lose money temporarily, your wealth mentality will attract it again. If you have a lack mentality, no matter how much you receive or what financial opportunities come your way, wealth will evade you or, if it comes, it won't last.

      <br> It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure, to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in movement there is life, and in change there is power.

The world has led us to believe that our wellbeing is dependent on other people loving us. But this is kind of upside down thinking that has caused so many of our problems.

      <a name="Dalai_Lama"> Compassion is not religious business, it is human business. It is not luxury. It is essential for our own peace and mental stability. It is essential for human survival. <br><b> Dalai Lama </b></a>
      <br>
      <br> I am open to the guidance of synchronicity, and do not let expectations hinder my path. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> I believe each human being has the potential to change, to transform one's own attitude, no matter how difficult the situation. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> I feel that the essence of spiritual practice is your attitude toward others. When you have a pure, sincere motivation, then you have right attitude toward others based on kindness, compassion, love and respect. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> I find hope in the darkest of days, and focus in the brightest. I do not judge the universe. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> I find that because of modern technological evolution and our global economy, and as a result of the great increase in population, our world has greatly changed: it has become much smaller. However, our perceptions have not evolved at the same pace; we continue to cling to old national demarcations and the old feelings of ‘us’ and ‘them’. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> If we want to save the world, we must have a plan. But no plan will work unless we meditate. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> In the past, destruction of your neighbour might have been considered a victory, but today we are all interdependent. We live in a global economy; we face problems like climate change that affect us all. The 7 billion human beings alive today belong to one human family. In the context that others’ interests are in our interest and our interest is in their interest, the use of force is self-destructive. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> It is time to fill the world with strong and powerful deeds. It is common knowledge that no great captain in the world has ever destroyed all of his enemies and lived with a sense of satisfaction. If one enemy is killed, two more will appear. It is important we cultivate love and compassion to all the sentient beings which is the way to bring peace to all. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> Our business is to be happy. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> Peace can only last where human rights are respected, where the people are fed, and where individuals and nations are free. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> Peace, in the sense of the absence of war, is of little value to someone who is dying of hunger or cold. It will not remove the pain of torture inflicted on a prisoner of conscience. It does not comfort those who have lost their loved ones in floods caused by senseless deforestation in a neighboring country. Peace can only last where human rights are respected, where the people are fed, and where individuals and nations are free. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.

      <br>
      <br> Sleep is the best meditation. 
      <br>

      <br>
      <br> Spend some time alone every day. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> The basic thing is that everyone wants happiness, no one wants suffering. And happiness mainly comes from our own attitude, rather than external factors. If you own mental attitude is correct, even if you remain in a hostile atmosphere, you feel happy. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> The more we think of others, the happier we are. The more we think of ourselves, the more suffering we feel. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> The period of greatest gain in knowledge and experience is the most difficult period in one's life. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> To be aware of a single shortcoming in oneself is more useful than to be aware of a thousand in someone else. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> Ultimately the creator is one's own mind. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> We can live without religion and meditation, but we cannot survive without human affection. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> We can never obtain peace in the outer world until we make peace with ourselves. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> When we feel love and kindness toward others, it not only makes other feel loved and cared for, but it helps us also to develop inner happiness and peace. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> With realization of one's own potential and self-confidence in one's ability, one can build a better world. 
      <br>
      <b> Dalai Lama </b>
      <br>
      <br> Without inner peace it is impossible to have world peace.

      <br> The positive effect of kindness on the immune system and on the increased production of serotonin in the brain has been proven in research studies. Serotonin is a naturally occurring substance in the body that makes us feel more comfortable, peaceful, and even blissful. In fact, the role of most anti-depressants is to stimulate the production of serotonin chemically, helping to ease depression. Research has shown that a simple act of kindness directed toward another improves the functioning of the immune system and stimulates the production of serotonin in both the recipient of the kindness and the person extending the kindness. Even more amazing is that persons observing the act of kindness have similar beneficial results. Imagine this! Kindness extended, received, or observed beneficially impacts the physical health and feelings of everyone involved!

      <br> It is a fact of life that we find ourselves in unpleasant demoralizing situations which we can neither escape nor control. We can keep our morale and spirits high by using both coping and hoping humor. Coping humor laughs at the hopelessness in our situation. It gives us the courage to hang in there, but it does not bring hope. The uniqueness of hoping humor lies in its acceptance of life with all its dichotomies, contradictions, and incongruities. It celebrates the hope in human life. From one comes courage, from the other comes inspiration.

From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know: that man is here for the sake of other men -- above all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness depends.

      <br> The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity. 
      <br>

      <br> The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery. There comes a leap in consciousness, call it intuition or what you will, and the solution comes to you, and you don't know how or why. 
      <br>

      <br> At one time I thought the most important thing was talent. I think now that the young man or the young woman must possess or teach himself, training himself, in infinite patience, which is to try and to try until it comes right. He must train himself in ruthless intolerance--that is to throw away anything that is false no matter how much he might love that page or that paragraph. The most important thing is insight, that is to be--curious--to wonder, to mull, and to muse why it is that man does what he does, and if you have that, then I don't think the talent makes much difference, whether you've got it or not.

      <br> After a few (or many) bad relationships, it's so easy to shut down, give up, and stop believing that the right person is out there for us. Our hearts yearn to fall in love, but our minds insist it's not possible, and we enter into a tug-of-war with ourselves. It's as if one part of us is screaming, Yes! I deserve a great relationship! while another part insists, I'll never find him or her.

If we believe that there is plenty of love in the world and we are worthy of giving and receiving that love, we will attract a different quality of relationships than someone who believes in scarcity or feels unworthy of happiness. If we believe the world is a loving and friendly place, then most of the time that will be our experience. If we believe the world is a chaotic, stressful, and fearful place, then eventually that will become our reality.

      <br> Don't aim at success - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run - in the long-run, I say! - success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it.

      <br> I have a history of making decisions very quickly about men. I have always fallen in love fast and without measuring risks. I have a tendency not only to see the best in everyone, but to assume that everyone is emotionally capable of reaching his highest potential. I have fallen in love more times than I care to count with the highest potential of a man, rather than with the man himself, and I have hung on to the relationship for a long time (sometimes far too long) waiting for the man to ascend to his own greatness. Many times in romance I have been a victim of my own optimism.

      <br> Smile, breathe, and go slowly. 
      <br>
      <b> Thich Nhat Hanh </b>
      <br>
      <br> Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy. 
      <br>
      <b> Thich Nhat Hanh </b>

      <br> The more compassionate you are, the more generous you can be. The more generous you are, the move loving friendliness you cultivate to help the world. 
      <br>
      <b> Thich Nhat Hanh </b>
      <br>
      <br> The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers.

      <b> Thich Nhat Hanh </b>

      <br>
      <b> Thich Nhat Hanh </b>

      <br> True love always brings joy to ourself and the one we love. If our love does not bring joy to both of us, it is not true love. 
      <br>
      <b> Thich Nhat Hanh </b>

      <br> When we change our daily lives - the way we think, speak and act - we change the world. 
      <br>
      <b> Thich Nhat Hanh </b>
      <br>
      <br> When we come into contact with the other person, our thoughts and actions should express our mind of compassion, even if that person says and does things that are not easy to accept. We practice in this way until we see clearly that our love is not contingent upon the other person being lovable. 
      <br>
      <b> Thich Nhat Hanh </b>
      <br>
      <br> When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don't blame the lettuce. You look for reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or family, we blame the other person. But if we know how to take care of them, they will grow well, like the lettuce. Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and argument. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change. 
      <br>
      <b> Thich Nhat Hanh </b>
      <br>
      <br> You cannot transmit wisdom and insight to another person. The seed is already there. A good teacher touches the seed, allowing it to wake up, to sprout and to grow. 
      <br>
      <b> Thich Nhat Hanh </b>

      <br> At any moment you have a choice that either leads you closer to your spirit or further away from it. 
      <br>
      <b> Thich Nhat Hanh </b>
      <br>
      <br> Do not be idolatrous about or bound to any doctrine, theory, or ideology, even Buddhist ones. All systems of thought are guiding means; they are not absolute truth. 
      <br>
      <b> Thich Nhat Hanh </b>
      <br>
      <br> Meditation is to be aware of what is going on in your body, in your feelings, in your mind, and in the world. 
      <br>
      <b> Thich Nhat Hanh </b>
      <br>
      <br> People deal too much with the negative, with what is wrong…Why not try and see positive things, to just touch those things and make them bloom?

      <br> The limbic system has links with the neocortex allowing for emotional/cognitive processing. It also works in concert with the body to elicit the physical signs of emotions like the flush of embarrassment, and the smile of joy. Limbic system emotions also determine the release of neurotransmitters that either strengthen or weaken our immune system. The limbic system consists of 5 major structures in the brain: the thalamus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, amygdala and hippocampus.

      <br> Your brain controls how you feel. It's the biggest playground in the world. What we think and feel creates secretions from the brain which in turn cause biochemical changes throughout the body. When we laugh and play, our body releases endorphins, the body's natural opiates.

You see, from the time a person is six years old until he graduates from college he has to take three or four examinations a year. If he flunks once, he is out. But an inventor is almost always failing. He tries and fails maybe a thousand times. It he succeeds once then he's in. These two things are diametrically opposite. We often say that the biggest job we have is to teach a newly hired employee how to fail intelligently.

If your primary responsibility in life is being true to yourself, that can only be accomplished by carrying out what you are called to do - your unique and special vocation...Your life's work involves doing what you love and loving what you do.

      <br> The true American dream not only provides the freedom to use your gifts and talents to achieve your highest goal but also gives you the freedom to fulfill your purpose in life. You are meant to work in ways that suit you, drawing on your natural talents and gifts. This work, when you find it and commit to it -- even if only as a hobby -- is the key to happiness.

      <br> There can be no richer man or woman than the individual who has found his or her labor of love. Personal fulfillment through the virtue of work is the highest form of desire. Work is the conduit between the supply and the demand of all human needs, the forerunner of human progress, and the medium by which the imagination is given the wings of action. A labor of love is exalted because it provides joy and self-expression to those who perform it.

What a miracle it is that out of these small, flat, rigid squares of paper unfolds world after world after world, worlds that sing to you, comfort and quiet or excite you.

Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there.

      <br> The whole idea of motivation is a trap. Forget motivation. Just do it. Exercise, lose weight, test your blood sugar, or whatever. Do it without motivation. And then, guess what? After you start doing the thing, that's when the motivation comes and makes it easy for you to keep on doing it.

      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> By whatever name one calls it, genuine creativity is characterized by an intensity of awareness, a heightened consciousness.

      <br> Creativity is not merely the innocent spontaneity of our youth and childhood; it must also be married to the passion of the adult human being, which is a passion to live beyond one's death. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>

      <br> Creativity is the encounter of the intensively conscious human being with his or her world.

      <br> Creativity occurs as an act of encounter, and is to be understood with this encounter at the center. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> Freedom is man's capacity to take a hand in his own development. It is our capacity to mold ourselves. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> Hate is not the opposite of love; apathy is. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> If you do not listen to your own original ideas, if you do not listen to your own being, you will have betrayed yourself. Also, you will have betrayed our community in failing to make your contribution to the whole. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> Joy is the zest that you get out of using your talents, your understanding, the totality of your being, for great aims…That's the kind of feeling that goes with creativity. That's why I say the courage to create. Creation does not come out of simply what you're born with. That must be united with your courage, both of which cause anxiety, but also great joy. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> Joy, rather than happiness, is the goal of life, for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings. It is based on the experience of one's identity as being of worth and dignity. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> Something is born, comes into being, something which did not exist before - which is as good a definition of creativity as we can get. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> The opposite of courage in our society is not cowardice, it is conformity. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> The relationship between commitment and doubt is by no means an antagonistic one. Commitment is healthiest when it is not without doubt, but in spite of doubt. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> We cannot will to have insights. We cannot will to have creativity, but we can will to give ourselves to the creative experience with intensity of dedication and commitment. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> We express our being by creating. Creativity is a necessary sequel to being. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> What anxiety means is it's as though the world is knocking at your door, and you need to create, you need to make something, you need to do something. I think anxiety, for people who have found their own heart and their own souls, for them it is a stimulus toward creativity, toward courage. It's what makes us human beings. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> What if imagination and art are not frosting at all, but the fountainhead of human experience? 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> What the artist or creative scientist feels is not anxiety or fear; it is joy. I use the word in contrast to happiness or pleasure. The artist, at the moment of creating, does not experience gratification or satisfaction…Rather, it is joy, joy defined as the emotion that goes with heightened consciousness, the mood that accompanies the experience of actualizing one's own potentialities. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> Whatever sphere we may be in, there is a profound joy in the realization that we are helping to form the structure of the new world. This is creative courage, however minor or fortuitous our creations may be. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> When you are completely caught up in something, you become oblivious to things around you, or to the passage of time. It is this absorption in what you are doing that frees your unconscious and released your creative imagination. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> Whereas moral courage is the fighting of wrongs, creative courage is the discovering of new forms, new symbols, new patterns on which a new (consciousness) society can be built. 
      <br>
      <b> Rollo May </b>
      <br>
      <br> Believe in your dreams. They were given to you for a reason. 
      <br>
      <b> Katrina Mayer </b>
      <br>
      <br> It's not only children who grow. Parents do too. As much as we watch to see what our children do with their lives, they are watching us to see what we do with ours. I can't tell my children to reach for the sun. All I can do is reach for it, myself. 
      <br>
      <b> Joyce Maynard </b>
      <br>
      <br> The tragedy in life does not lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach. It isn’t a calamity to die with dreams unfulfilled, but it is a calamity not to dream. It is not a disaster to be unable to capture your ideal, but it is a disaster to have no ideal to capture. It is not a disgrace not to reach the starts, but is is a disgrace to have no stars to reach for.

This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.

      <br> Creative freedom is determined by how we behold the world. Any one of us can make new things with our perceptions that serve as doorways to the creative imagination. No one is excluded. 
      <br>
      <b> Shaun McNiff </b>
      <br>
      <br> Creativity can be defined as an original act of imagination that brings something into existence. It is a desire and innate drive to make new connections between things, to give form, and to transform.

      <br> Creativity is a force moving through us, and only through practice do we learn how to cooperate with it. The ‘process’ is like a muscle. It needs to be exercised in order to function effortlessly. 
      <br>
      <b> Shaun McNiff </b>
      <br>
      <br> Curiosity and attentiveness become active participants in the creative process as we learn how to watch what we do while we are doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not easy, because our ego 'judges' are thoroughly ingrained in us, but struggles abate as commitment and familiarity increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art becomes part of the tradition of meditation where watchfulness is essential.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever a person paints, dances, or sings has significance when we restrain ego's value judgments.&nbsp;&nbsp;These discoveries are similar to the meditator's experience of wonder in something that was once boring and insignificant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Judgment yields to awareness.

All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed would have come his way.

      <br> None of us needs instruction in how to recognize what your heart is saying. We do need guidance, however, on how to have the courage to follow those feelings, since they will force us to change our lives in any case. But consider the consequences of not listening to the heart's guidance: depression, confusion, and the wretched feeling that we are not on our life's true path, but viewing it from a distance.

      <br>
      <br> The ability to know that your perceptions are accurate has to happen without others' validation. Intuition is not the result of diet, rituals, or wind chimes. It's the natural consequence of having self-esteem, the greatest power you can have. With self-esteem, your life can broaden into an adventure because you can know in your gut that you can handle the unknown. And you can handle helping others without fear, which is true liberation. 
      <br>

      <br> You cannot change anything in your life with intention alone, which can become a watered-down, occasional hope that you'll get to tomorrow. Intention without action is useless.

      <br> To a greater or lesser extent there goes on in every person a struggle between two forces: the longing for privacy and the urge to go places: the introversion, interest directed within oneself toward one's own inner life of vigorous thought and fancy; and extroversion, interest directed outward, toward the external world of people and tangible values.

The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity. Americans know this. We know that government can't solve all our problems – and we don't want it to. But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own.

When your creativity comes to a climax, when your whole life becomes creative, you live in God. So he must be the creator because people who have been creative have been closest to him. Love what you do. Be meditative while you are doing it – whatsoever it is!

      <br> Achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life, and that happiness - not pain or mindless self-indulgence - is the proof of your moral integrity, since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values. 
      <br>
      <b> Ayn Rand </b>
      <br>
      <br> A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others.

      <br>
      <br> Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won. It exists, it is real, it is possible, it is yours.

      <br> Serving others helps strengthen your creativity by providing low-risk avenues of self-expression while making a difference in the lives of others. The joy of giving, the joy of creating, and the joy of helping come from service.

      <br> Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will find them gradually, without noticing it, and live along some distant day into the answer.

They only reason we really pursue goals is to cause ourselves to expand and grow.

      <br> The genuinely significant creation, whether an idea, or a work of art, or a scientific discovery, is most likely to be seen at first as erroneous, bad, or foolish. Later it may be seen as obvious, something self-evident to all. Only still later does it receive its final evaluation as a creative contribution. It seems clear no contemporary mortal can satisfactorily evaluate a creative product at the time it is formed, and this statement is increasingly true the greater the novelty of the creation.

      <br> I believe we are all capable of being profoundly, beautifully creative, where we use that creativity to relate to family or to paint a picture. The seeds of much of our creativity come from the unconscious, our feelings, and our intuition. The unconscious is our deep well. Many of us have put a lid over that well. Feelings can be constructively channeled into creative ventures: into dance, music, art, or writing. When our feelings are joyful, the art form uplifts. When our feelings are violent or wrathful, we can transform them into powerful art rather than venting them on the world. Such art helps us accept that aspect of ourselves. Self-acceptance is paramount to compassion for others.

      <br> If you want to attract a life partner as your soul mate, there are several illusions you will need to relinquish. One is that your soul mate is someone you will be with for the rest of your life. You can have a soul mate relationship that lasts a few weeks, months, or years. Time has nothing to do with the quality of your connection and its importance in your life.

      <br> Most people have more than one soul mate. You may already be in several soul mate relationships with friends and loved ones. A soul mate can come in the form of a life partner, treasured friend, child, or lover. A soul mate can be someone with whom you share a spiritual path, a joint work in the world, or a commitment to be parents to certain souls. It can be someone whose growth you are sponsoring, such as a child.

Self-abuse comes from self-rejection, and self-rejection comes from having an image of what it means to be perfect and never measuring up to that ideal.

      <br> There is a path from me to you that I am constantly looking for. 
      <br>
      <b> Rumi </b>
      <br>
      <br> This human being is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival. A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they're a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still treat each guest honorably. He may be clearing you out for some new delight. 
      <br>
      <b> Rumi </b>
      <br>
      <br> To change, you must face the dragon of your appetites with another dragon: the life-energy of the soul. 
      <br>
      <b> Rumi </b>
      <br>
      <br> When you do things from your soul, you feel a river of joy within you.

      <br>
      <b> Rumi </b>
      <br>
      <br> Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. 
      <br>
      <b> Rumi </b>
      <br>
      <br> There is a community of the spirit. Join it, and feel the delight of walking in the noisy street and being the noise. Drink all your passion, and be a disgrace. Close both eyes to see with the other eye.

      <b> Rumi </b>
      <br>
      <br> Happiness is not a state to arrive at, but a manner of traveling.

      <br> It is human nature to be creative. 
      <br>
      <b> Mark Runco </b>
      <br>
      <br> The definition of creativity as construction of personal meaning is also consistent with the notion that creativity is a kind of self-expression and self-actualization.

      <b> Mark Runco </b>
      <br>
      <br> Those who do not have power over the story that dominates their lives, power to retell it, to rethink it, deconstruct it, joke about it, and change it as times change, truly are powerless, because they cannot think new thoughts.

      <b> Salman Rushdie </b>
      <br>
      <br> In every person who comes near you look for what is good and strong; honor that; try to imitate it, and your faults will drop off like dead leaves when their time comes.

      <br>
      <br> Gratitude helps us to return to our natural state of joyfulness, where we notice what's right instead of what's wrong. It makes us feel complete, that we have everything we need, at least in this moment.

      <br> It is necessary to write, if the days are not to slip emptily by. How else, indeed, to clap the net over the butterfly of the moment? For the moment passes, it is forgotten; the mood is gone; life itself is gone. That is where the writer scores over his fellows: he catches the changes of his mind on the hop.

      <br> A new consciousness is developing which sees the earth as a single organism and recognizes that an organism at war with itself is doomed. We are one planet.

      <br> A daily creative project is like a marathon. It's a ridiculously daunting task, but making an original creation every day gives you an incredible sense of accomplishment. It also forces you to push beyond your mental and physical barriers (especially the ones you've erected for yourself). You'll be amazed at what you produce and what you learn about yourself in the process.

      <br> The spirit of entrepreneurship includes imagination, inventiveness and openness to the new. This spirit of creative response aligns with the capacity to exercise moral imagination and to see ethical problems in a new light. To be sure, our most fundamental ethical values -- values such as honesty, avoiding doing harm, keeping commitments -- are grounded in timeless traditions and are not likely to be soon abandoned. But it is in the application of these ethical values to emerging, unique situations, where moral imagination and the entrepreneurial spirit can make a decisive difference.

It will make or break a company, a church, a home. The remarkable thing is, we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change the past. We cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play the one string we have, and that is our attitude.

      <br> There are some books that refuse to be written. They stand their ground year after year and will not be persuaded. It isn't because the book is not there and worth being written -- it is only because the right form of the story does not present itself. There is only one right form for a story and if you fail to find that form the story will not tell itself.

      <br> What a wee little part of a person's life are his acts and his words! His real life is led in his head, and is known to none but himself. All day long, the mill of his brain is grinding, and his thoughts, not those of other things, are his history. These are his life, and they are not written. Everyday would make a whole book of 80,000 words -- 365 books a year. Biographies are but the clothes and buttons of the man -- the biography of the man himself cannot be written.

      <br> What work I have done I have done because it has been play. If it had been work I shouldn't have done it. Who was it who said, Blessed is the man who has found his work? Whoever it was he had the right idea in his mind. Mark you, he says his work—not somebody else's work. The work that is really a man's own work is play and not work at all. Cursed is the man who has found some other man's work and cannot lose it. When we talk about the great workers of the world we really mean the great players of the world. The fellows who groan and sweat under the weary load of toil that they bear never can hope to do anything great. How can they when their souls are in a ferment of revolt against the employment of their hands and brains? The product of slavery, intellectual or physical, can never be great.

      <br> It is precisely human creative activity that makes the human being a creature oriented toward the future, creating the future and thus altering his own present. This creative activity, based on the ability of our brain to combine elements, is called imagination.

      <br>
      <br> A lot of people say they want to get out of pain, and I'm sure that's true, but they aren't willing to make healing a high priority. They aren't willing to look inside to see the source of their pain in order to deal with it.

      <br> Heaven. Now there's a thought. Nothing has ever been able, ultimately, to convince me we live anywhere else. And that heaven, more a verb than a noun, more a&nbsp;condition than a place, is all about leading with the heart in whatever broken or ragged state it's in, stumbling forward in faith until, from time to time, we miraculously find our way. Our way to forgiveness, our way to letting go, our way to understanding, compassion and peace. It is laughter, I think, that bubbles up at last and says, Ho, I think we are there. And that "there" is always here.

It speaks to us... guides us... passion rules us all, and we obey. What other choice do we have? Passion is the source of our finest moments. The joy of love... the clarity of hatred... and the ecstasy of grief. It hurts sometimes more than we can bear. If we could live without passion maybe we'd know some kind of peace... but we would be hollow... Empty rooms shuttered and dank. Without passion we'd be truly dead.

      <br>
      <br> For one who is indifferent, life itself is a prison. Any sense of community is external or, even worse, nonexistent. Thus, indifference means solitude. Those who are indifferent do not see others. They feel nothing for others and are unconcerned with what might happen to them. They are surrounded by a great emptiness. Filled by it, in fact. They are devoid of all hope as well as imagination. In other words, devoid of any future. 
      <br>

      <br> Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing.

      <br>
      <br> The opposite of love is not hate, its indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it’s indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it’s indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, its indifference.

Look at little children in kindergarten. They're all different without trying to be. As long as they're unselfconsciously being themselves, they can't help but shine.

      <br> Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we're liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

      <br> I live in the space of thankfulness – and I have been rewarded a million times over for it. I started out giving thanks for small things, and the more thankful I became, the more my bounty increased. That's because what you focus on expands, and when you focus on the goodness in your life, you create more of it. Opportunities, relationships, even money flowed my way when I learned to be grateful no matter what happened in my life. 
      <br>
      <b> Oprah Winfrey </b>

      <b> Oprah Winfrey </b>
      <br>
      <br> I trust in the ebb and flow of the universe. I trust that life's bigger than what I can see. I trust that there is a divine order beyond my control. And I trust that no matter what happens, I will be all right.

      <br> Ignoring your passion is like dying a slow death…Passion whispers to you through your feelings, beckoning you toward your highest good. Pay attention to what makes you feel energized, connected, stimulated- what gives you your juice. Do what you love, give it back in the form of service, and you will do more than succeed. You will triumph.

      <b> Oprah Winfrey </b>
      <br>
      <br> What I know for sure is that your life is a multipart series of all your experiences- and each experience is created by your thoughts, intentions, and actions to teach you what you need to know. Your life is a journey of learning to love yourself first and then extending that love to others in every encounter.

      <br> When you don’t know what to do, get still. The answer will come. 
      <br>
      <b> Oprah Winfrey </b>
      <br>
      <br> When you make loving others the story of your life, there's never a final chapter, because the legacy continues. You lend your light to one person, and he or she shines it on another and another and another.

      <br>
      <br> You are responsible for your life. You can’t keep blaming somebody else for your dysfunction. Life is really about moving on. 
      <br>
      <b> Oprah Winfrey </b>
      <br>
      <br> You become what you believe – not what you wish or want but what you truly believe. Wherever you are in life, look at your beliefs. They put you there. 
      <br>
      <b> Oprah Winfrey </b>
      <br>
      <br> You have to find what sparks a light in you so that you in your own way can illuminate the world. 
      <br>
      <b> Oprah Winfrey </b>
      <br>
      <br> You must define your own life. Don't let other people write your script. 
      <br>
      <b> Oprah Winfrey </b>
      <br>
      <br> 1. The path is not straight, 2. Mistakes need not be fatal. 3. People are more important than achievements or possessions. 4. Be gentle with your parents. 5. Never stop doing what you care most about. 6. Learn to use a semicolon. 7. You will find love.

      <br> When you improve a little each day, eventually big things occur. When you improve conditioning a little each day, eventually you have a big improvement in conditioning. Not tomorrow, not the next day, but eventually a big gain is made. Don't look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time.

      <br>
      <b> Virginia Woolf </b>
      <br>
      <br> It is worth mentioning, for future reference, that the creative power which bubbles so pleasantly in beginning a new book quiets down after a time, and one goes on more steadily. Doubts creep in. Then one becomes resigned. Determination not to give in, and the sense of an impending shape keep one at it more than anything.

      <br> Though nothing can bring back the hour of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower; We will grieve not, rather find strength in what remains behind; In the primal sympathy which having been must ever be; In the soothing thoughts that spring out of human suffering; In the faith that looks through death, in years that bring the philosophic mind.

      <br> Resentment is one burden that is incompatible with your success. Always be the first to forgive; and forgive yourself first always. 
      <br>
      <b> Dan Zadra </b>
      <br>
      <br> Take action on your ideas. Procrastination is the mortal enemy of spontaneous brilliance. 
      <br>
      <b> Dan Zadra </b>
      <br>
      <br> Worry is misuse of imagination. 
      <br>
      <b> Dan Zadra </b>
      <br>
      <br> If you love someone, hurry up and show it. 
      <br>
      <b> Rosie Zadra </b>
      <br>
      <br> Books are mirrors: you only see in them what you already have inside you. 
      <br>
      <b> Carlos Ruiz Zafon </b>
      <br>
      <br> Oxytocin connects us to other people; oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel. And it’s easy to cause people’s brains to release oxytocin. Let me show you. Come here. Give me a hug. 
      <br>
      <b> Paul Zak </b>
      <br>
      <br> There are more love songs than anything else. If songs could make you do something we'd all love one another. 
      <br>
      <b> Frank Zappa </b>
      <br>
      <br> Art is making something out of nothing and selling it. 
      <br>
      <b> Frank Zappa </b>
      <br>
      <br> Distance makes the heart grow fonder, and familiarity breeds contempt. According to this my soul mate should be in Thailand. 
      <br>
      <b> Jason Zebehazy </b>
      <br>
      <br> Great leaders are not defined by the absence of weakness, but rather by the presence of clear strengths. 
      <br>
      <b> John&nbsp;Zenger </b>
      <br>
      <br> For marriage to be a success, every woman and every man should have her and his own bathroom. The end. 
      <br>
      <b> Catherine Zeta-Jones </b>
      <br>
      <br> Great knowledge is universal. Small knowledge is limited. Great words are inspiring; small words are chatter. 
      <br>
      <b> Zhuangzi </b>
      <br>
      <br> Other people and things can stop you temporarily. You're the only one who can do it permanently. 
      <br>
      <b> Zig Ziglar </b>
      <br>
      <br> A pessimist is a person who is seasick during the entire voyage of life. 
      <br>
      <b> Zig Ziglar </b>
      <br>
      <br> Life is too short to spend your precious time trying to convince a person who wants to live in gloom and doom otherwise. Give lifting that person your best shot, but don’t hang around long enough for his or her bad attitude to pull you down. Instead, surround yourself with optimistic people. 
      <br>
      <b> Zig Ziglar </b>
      <br>
      <br> One can get anything if he is willing to help enough others get what they want. 
      <br>
      <b> Zig Ziglar </b>
      <br>
      <br> Stop selling, start helping. 
      <br>
      <b> Zig Ziglar </b>
      <br>
      <br> Will what I am about to do, bring me closer to, or take me further from my goals? 
      <br>
      <b> Zig Ziglar </b>
      <br>
      <br> You are the only person on earth who can use your ability. 
      <br>
      <b> Zig Ziglar </b>
      <br>
      <br> You can make positive deposits in your own economy every day by reading and listening to powerful, positive, life-changing content and by associating with encouraging and hope-building people. 
      <br>
      <b> Zig Ziglar </b>
      <br>
      <br> Be a traveler, not a tourist. Try new things, meet new people and look beyond what’s right in front of you. Those are the keys to understanding this amazing world we live in. 
      <br>
      <b> Andrew Zimmern </b>
      <br>
      <br> During those rare moments of creativeness, when an ordinary person has something in common with the making of the universe, he feels a sense of transcendence, of moving beyond his daily life. What could be a greater reward? 
      <br>
      <b> Joseph Zinker </b>
      <br>
      <br> The creative person seems to have a special talent for dipping into his intuitive, image-filled right hemisphere while harnessing the illuminating experience with his left brain. 
      <br>
      <b> Steven Zinker </b>
      <br>
      <br> Historically, the most terrible things – war, genocide, and slavery – have resulted not from disobedience, but from obedience. 
      <br>
      <b> Howard Zinn </b>
      <br>
      <br> We don't have to engage in grand, heroic actions to participate in the process of change. Small acts, when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world. 
      <br>
      <b> Howard Zinn </b>
      <br>
      <br> If you ask me what I came to do in this world, I, an artist, I will answer you: I am here to live out loud. 
      <br>
      <b> Émile Zola </b>
      <br>
      <br> Love does more than bring peace where there is conflict. It brings a different way of being in the world. 
      <br>
      <b> Gary Zukav </b>
      <br>
      <br> Eventually you will come to understand that love heals everything, and love is all there is. 
      <br>
      <b> Gary Zukav </b>
      <br>
      <br> Forgiveness means you do not hold others responsible for your experience. 
      <br>
