     <p> <img class="left" src="http://cdn.recreateyourlifestory.com/wp-content/themes/supportdesk/images/lori-200.jpg" alt="Lori Deschene"> My name is Lori Deschene, and I'm the founder of Tiny Buddha. I created this course with my partner, screenwriter Ehren Prudhel, because I know what it's like to <strong>live in regret and feel powerless and stuck because of it.</strong> </p> 
     <p> I spent the majority of my life dwelling on events from the past that seemed unfair and choices I made that caused me to feel ashamed. </p> 
     <p> I obsessed about what should have happened, what shouldn't have happened, what I should have done, what I shouldn't have done, and how everything would be better if I could just go back and change it all. </p> 
     <p> Since launching tinybuddha.com in 2009, I've personally connected with thousands of readers, and I've realized this is something that many of us have in common: <strong>we allow our feelings and beliefs about the past to limit our effectiveness and happiness in the present.</strong> </p> 
     <p> And even though we want to let go, we don't know how to live a life that doesn't revolve around our former pain. So instead, we keep telling ourselves the same old limiting stories—and in the process, live the story of now based on a sad one from before. </p> 
     <p> <strong>The good news is that we can change how we interpret yesterday, how we view ourselves in response, and how we live today as a result.</strong> </p> 
     <p> Recreate Your Life Story helps you do just that. </p>

      <!-- <img src="" alt="DK"> -->"The course was a bargain considering what I got out of it… It was always fun and not too serious. This made it more interesting and gave me permission to laugh at myself, which can be a source of confidence and relaxation in stressful conditions.

    <div id="movies" class="box"> 
     <h3 class="feature">Why Movies?</h3> 
     <p> Film is a big part of the course—for one, because it's a lot more fun that way! But there's more to it than that. </p> 
     <p> It can be hard to view ourselves objectively because we're in our heads all day, every day, and sometimes we're too close to our challenges to recognize how they may actually work <em>for</em> us, not <em>against</em> us. </p> 
     <p> It's a whole different story when we watch a movie and see a character in similar circumstances. </p> 
     <p> <strong>We empathize with them, despite their flaws; we root for their happiness and success; and we invest ourselves in seeing them learn, grow, and attain not just what they want, but also what they need.</strong> </p> 
     <p> Throughout each module, we use analogies and references from movies to help you see yourself as the hero of your story. </p> 
     <p> It's not about being selfish or convincing yourself that the world revolves around you. It's about changing how you see yourself, what you believe is possible for you, and what you tell yourself and do as a result. </p> 
     <p> And this also magnifies the impact you're able to make on the world—which means everyone around you benefits. </p> 
     <p> When you see yourself as the hero of our own story, you <strong>radically transform how you perceive and treat yourself, how you view and meet challenges, and what you believe you deserve and can achieve in life.</strong> </p> 
     <p> Most people go through their whole lives without ever empowering themselves to change what isn't working—and without ever looking within to understand <em>why</em> it isn't. </p> 
     <p> It's easier to never question why you're doing what you're doing, and whether it's actually serving your needs, desires, hopes, and dreams. It's easier to continue with things as they are than it is to imagine how they could be. </p> 
     <p> <strong>But most of us come to regret the things we <em>didn't</em> do more than the things we did.</strong> </p> 
     <p> Most of us get to the end of our lives and see so clearly all the risks we could have taken, the experiences we could have had, and the new things we could have tried—if only we found the courage to step away from the old. </p> 
     <p> It <strong>doesn't take immense bravery, strength, or vision to change the trajectory of your life.</strong> It takes one tiny step in a new direction, backed by belief not in the destination, but in the journey and yourself. </p> 
     <p> Recreate Your Life Story can be that first step. </p>

     <h1 class="center">The Top 10 Limiting Stories<br>We Tell Ourselves</h1> 
     <p> We all tell ourselves stories about ourselves and our lives that keep us feeling unfulfilled, unhappy, and powerless to change. And though we may sometimes feel alone with our struggles and fears, they're the same for many of us. </p> 
     <p> <strong>Have you told yourself any of these stories?</strong> </p> 
     <ol> 
      <li>I can't be happy because life's not fair.</li> 
      <li>I've already made my choices. My hands are tied now.</li> 
      <li>I'm too messed up; I've been through so much!</li> 
      <li>I don't deserve success or happiness because…</li> 
      <li>I'm not good enough. Even if I try, I'll probably fail.</li> 
      <li>My parents really screwed me up by…</li> 
      <li>I can't change because I always find a way to mess things up.</li> 
      <li>I always make the "wrong" decisions in life.</li> 
      <li>Things never work out for me, no matter what I do.</li> 
      <li>I'm not smart (or talented or brave or…)</li> 
     </ol> 
     <p> <strong>These may seem like facts, but they are actually beliefs based on interpretations of facts. That means that these stories don't have to have power over you.</strong> </p> 
     <p> When you change your stories—your beliefs about yourself, your past, and your present—you set the wheels in motion to change your life. </p> 
     <p> Regardless of your unique life experiences, you can change your stories—and we can give you the tools and support to do it. </p>

     <p> And the investment might <em>not</em> be worth it if you take the course and still feel stuck in old, painful stories that make you feel paralyzed with doubt and regret. </p> 
     <p> But there's a possibility that <strong>this course may completely transform your perception of yourself, your past, and your life.</strong> There's a possibility that it will help you feel happier, freer, and more excited about life than ever before. </p> 
     <p> And there's also a 30-day money-back guarantee—so the risk is on us if it doesn't do those things. </p>
