   <h4>Thoughts For Day 11 - 15</h4> 
   <p>Adults are just kids who owe money</p> 
   <p>It is easier to preach ten sermons than it is to live one </p> 
   <p>People are funny. They want the front of the bus, middle of the road, and the back of the church.</p> 
   <p>Opportunity may knock once, but temptation bangs on your door for years.</p> 
   <p>Quit griping about your church if it was perfect, you couldn't belong.</p> 
   <p>If the church wants a better pastor, it only needs to pray for the one it has.</p> 
   <p>God Himself does not propose to judge a man till he is dead. So why should you? </p> 
   <p>Age is a matter of mind; If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.</p> 
   <p>I don't know why some people change churches. What difference does it make which one you stay home from?</p> 
   <p>A lot of church members who are singing 'Standing on the Promises'<br>are just sitting on the premises.</p> 
   <p>Outside of traffic, there is nothing that has holds this country back as much as committees</p> 
   <p>Funny how we set our clocks to arise at 5:00am to be at the job by 7:30, yet when Sunday comes we can't get to church for 11:00am to praise the one who gave us the jobs!</p> 
   <p>Funny how we call God our Father and Jesus our brother, but find it hard to introduce them to our family.</p> 
   <p>Funny how we demand justice for others, but expect mercy from God</p> 
   <p>Funny how much difficulty some have learning the gospel well enough to tell others, but how simple it is to understand and explain the latest gossip about someone else</p> 
   <p> Funny how we can't think of anything to say when we pray, but don't have any difficulty thinking of things to talk about to a friend</p> 
   <p>Funny how people want God to answer their prayers, but refuse to listen to His counsel</p> 
   <p>Funny how people think they are going to Heaven but don't think there is a Hell.</p>

   <br> 
   <h4>Thoughts For Day 16 - 20</h4> 
   <p>Funny how it is okay to blame God for evil and suffering in the world,but it is not necessary to thank Him for what is good and pleasant</p> 
   <p>Funny how we are so quick to take directions from a total stranger when we are lost, but are hesitant to take God's direction for our lives.</p> 
   <p>Funny how small our sins seem, but how big 'their' sins are</p> 
   <p>Funny how when something goes wrong, we cry, 'Lord, why me?' but when something goes right, we think, 'Hey,it must be me! </p> 
   <p>Big shots are little shots who just keep shooting </p> 
   <p>Half of being smart, is knowing what you're dumb at.</p> 
   <p>Success comes in cans, not in can'ts.</p> 
   <p>Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice.</p> 
   <p>No burden is too heavy if it is carried with love.</p> 
   <p>Happiness is not how much you have, but how much you enjoy it.</p> 
   <p>The mind is like a parachute. It only works when open. </p> 
   <p>Some minds are like concrete, thoroughly mixed up and permanently set. </p> 
   <p>Love waits!</p> 
   <p>There is no greater invitation to love, than loving first.</p> 
   <p>Obstacles are what you see, when you take your eyes off the goal.</p> 
   <p>We accomplish in proportion to what we attempt.</p> 
   <p>We each need the maturity to recognize that the things that we share are far more important than the disagreements we have.</p> 
   <p>A man who can smile when things go wrong, has thought of someone he can blame.</p> 
   <p>God does not call people as a favor, but because He has something for them to do.</p> 
   <p>The perfect love would be one that gives all and expects nothing in return. For if one expects nothing, and asks nothing, they can never be deceived or disappointed. It is only when love demands that it brings on pain. </p>

   <h4>Thoughts For Day 21 - -25</h4> 
   <p> I used be an idealist, until I got mugged by reality.</p> 
   <p>God Loves You! Enough Said!</p> 
   <p>Some people have enough religion to make them hate but not enough to make them love.</p> 
   <p>Be not afraid of moving slowly; Be afraid of standing still.</p> 
   <p>Those who say it can't be done, are usually interrupted by others doing it.</p> 
   <p>You don't know where you are going, if you are always looking back.</p> 
   <p>We all have stumbling blocks. What is most important is turning them into stepping stones.</p> 
   <p>Happiness is the illusion that things are not as crazy as they really are. </p> 
   <p>It is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. </p> 
   <p>How often do I desire something, and that something is already there in my heart.</p> 
   <p>When you can't solve a problem, manage it!</p> 
   <p>No one cares how much you know, until they know how much you care!</p> 
   <p>You can give without loving, but you cannot love without giving.</p> 
   <p>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. (John 15:13 KJV)</p> 
   <p>Politeness is making company feel at home, when you wish they were.</p> 
   <p> It is easier to fight for ones principles, than to live up to them.</p> 
   <p>Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.</p> 
   <p>People who wait until the eleventh hour to call on Jesus, usually die at 10:59. </p>

   <h4>Thoughts For Day 26 - 30</h4> 
   <p>People are lonely, because they build walls instead of bridges.</p> 
   <p>He who does not hope to win, has already lost.</p> 
   <p>Those who think they know it all upset those of us who do.</p> 
   <p>The love we give, is the only love we keep.</p> 
   <p>It often shows a fine command of the language, to say nothing.</p> 
   <p>Time is too slow for those who wait; Too swift for those who fear; Too long for those who grieve; Too short for those who rejoice; But for those who love....time is not. </p> 
   <p>For one human being to love another; That is perhaps the most difficult task; The work for which all other work is but preparation.</p> 
   <p>I look at the stone cutter hammering away at the rock a hundred times, without so much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred-and-first blow it splits in two. I know it was not that one blow that did it, but all that had gone before.</p> 
   <p>Happiness is like a kiss; It feels best when you give it to someone else.</p> 
   <p>Almost anything is easier to get into, than to get out of.</p> 
   <p>Contentment is not the fulfillment of what you want, but the realization of how much you already have.</p> 
   <p>Happiness is found along the way, not at the end of the journey.</p> 
   <p>We can only appreciate the miracle of a sunrise, if we have waited in darkness.</p> 
   <p>Keep smiling, it makes people wonder what you have been up to. </p> 
   <p>I'm going to stop putting things off, starting tomorrow.</p> 
   <p>Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example.</p> 
   <p>When a fellow says it isn't the money, but the principle of the thing..... it's the money!</p> 
   <p>If it were not for optimists, pessimists would never know how unhappy they are.</p> 
   <p>It is the weak who are cruel. Gentleness can only be expected from the strong.</p> 
   <p>You are your words!</p> 
   <p>It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt.</p> 
   <p>The opposite of love is not hate......it's apathy! </p> 
   <br>
