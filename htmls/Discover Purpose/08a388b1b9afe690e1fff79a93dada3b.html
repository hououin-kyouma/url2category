Then you too will acquire a fraction of that Supreme Love.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Love as Thought is Truth. &nbsp;<br> Love as Action is Right Conduct. &nbsp;<br> Love as Understanding is Peace. &nbsp;<br> Love as Feeling is Non-violence.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Duty without love is deplorable. &nbsp;<br> Duty with love is desirable. &nbsp;<br> Love without duty is Divine.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your heart must be transparent, like glass, with spiritual light within illuminating the whole world.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Peace can only be won the hard way, by eliminating violence and greed from the hearts of individual.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The secret of happiness is not doing what one likes to do but in liking what one has to do.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The end of wisdom is freedom; The end of culture is perfection;&nbsp;<br> The end of knowledge is love; The end of education is character.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">First you must grapple with the fact that duty is God and start doing your duty.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I have come not to disturb or destroy any faith, but to confirm each in his own faith - so that Christian becomes a better Christian, the Muslim, a better Muslim, and the Hindu, a better Hindu.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Transmuting "man" into "God" and experiencing that Ananda or Bliss is the one and only achievement for which life is to be devoted.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The minimum qualifications for Grace are surrender of ego.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The treasure that is precious is the quality of even mindedness in all situations.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The joy of being the master of senses is far greater than being their slave.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your progress is reflected back as Grace, your decline is reflected back as its absence. The mirror just reflects. It has no partiality or prejudice.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sathya is what I teach; &nbsp;<br> Dharma is the way I live; &nbsp;<br> Shanthi is the mark of My personality; &nbsp;<br> Prema is my very Nature.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Peace is shore less ocean - it is the light that illuminates the world.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Virtue is the sign of the educated person.

Discard desire and you are liberated.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Devotion has to be unintermittent, uninterrupted, like the flow of oil from one vessel to another.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Human society minus God is equal to a forest of brutes.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bear all and do nothing; &nbsp;<br> Hear all and say nothing; &nbsp;<br> Give all and take nothing; &nbsp;<br> Serve all and be nothing.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Man minus immorality is Immortality.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">God is for those, who are not for themselves.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So long as the sugar is on the tongue, you feel the sweetness in taste. Similarly, so long as the heart has love, peace and devotion, you feel the bliss.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you will not rise above the things of the world, they will rise above you.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Praying is your task; what happens to the prayer is dependent on the Grace of God.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Seek out your faults and others' merits.

Acquiring good qualities can be the only purpose of education.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">True devotion must not get dispirited; nor elated or satisfied with lesser gains; it must fight against failure, loss, calumny, calamity, ridicule and against egoism and pride, impatience and cowardice.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Follow the Master; &nbsp;<br> Face the devil; &nbsp;<br> Fight to the end; &nbsp;<br> Finish the goal.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If animal feelings are washed out, Divine feelings begin to overflow instead.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A man who has no love in him is as barren as a cloud with no moisture, a tree with no fruits or a cow yielding no milk; he is ever far from God and can never earn His Grace.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Life is a bridge over the sea of changes. Do not build a house on it.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the innermost recess of your heart there is a reservoir of peace where you must take refuge.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Employ yourself usefully.

Only those who acquire these qualities can be called truly educated.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Devotion to the Divine will give you Bliss, Prosperity and Peace. It cannot inflict pain, perturbation or personal anxiety. It fosters love and brings all together as one band of brothers.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Every action of yours at the present time is bound to have a reaction, resound and reflection in the future.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Reach the point where churches, temples, mosques do not matter, where all roads end, from where all roads run.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Doing one's duty, however small, in an unattached manner gives rise to the awakening of self-awareness.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bend the body, mend the senses and end the mind - this is the way to Immortality.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why fear when I am here?

Shed one tear, I shall wipe a hundred from your eyes.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The proof of rain is in the wetness of the ground; the proof of devotion is in the peace the aspirant has attained.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Every experience is a lesson, every loss is a gain.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You should completely forget the help rendered by you to others and the harm done to you by others.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If wealth is lost, nothing is lost. &nbsp;<br> If health is lost, something is lost. &nbsp;<br> If character is lost, all is lost.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The body has to be utilized for service to others. More bliss can be got from serving others than from merely serving oneself.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You should consider every individual as God. This is true worship.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You are not doing service for others. You are doing it always for yourselves, to the God in you, the God who is equally present in others.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If it is good and will harm no one, go ahead. If it is not good, put it aside. If not sure, do nothing until sure.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What is needed today is that we should lead a life of good quality. The fostering of sterling character and good conduct is the need of the world. Once we have greater numbers of such people of good quality, the country and the world will become prosperous and peaceful.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You must act ever in the consciousness of your divinity and recognize in each being, a brother, a child of God. The whole world is one family.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The only permanent change is slow, steady change.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">God, if you think, God you are&nbsp;<br> Dust if you think, dust you are&nbsp;<br> As you think, so you become&nbsp;<br> Think God, be God.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Those who seek to acquire steadiness of faith must first acquire the strength to bear grief and pain, insult and injury. The succession of joy and grief must help confirm the faith and make it immovable. That alone can evidence true devotion.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Individual spiritual practice is the negative pole and service is the positive pole. The conjunction of both poles can alone bring success. The mind carries the divine principle (the light of love) and conveys it to all who contact it.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We can be successful leaders only if we are disciplined followers, who do not issue commands to others but rather set an example of service in our actions.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you have the inclination to do good work, God will give you the time to do good things.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Man falsely imagines "I am doing this", "I am planning this". It is the supreme, all pervasive consciousness that motivates, unfolds the skills and operates the intellect.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let God work through you and there will be no more duty. Let God shine forth. Let God show Himself. Live God, Eat God. Drink God. Breathe God. Realize the Truth and the other things will take care of themselves.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Treat all as your own self. Do not have a double standard.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What you would desire others to do for you, you should do for others. You should respect others, as you want to be respected by them.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Love all men without distinction; Know that mankind is a single community.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Is the intention pure, selfless, and born out of love? Is it based on truth? Does it result in peace? If so, it is a right action.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">True humanness consists of a continuous series of tiny acts executed with absolute sincerity and largeness of heart.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The quality of one's feelings determines one's future.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Think before speaking; Think before acting; Then go ahead, If you feel good about it.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">See good - Hear good&nbsp; - Speak good - Do good - Be good</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you strive to find your Self by using your mind, you will strive and strive in vain, because the mind cannot give you the Truth. You are that Self. All else is illusion of the mind's creation.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Every being in the universe has the potentiality of transcending the senses. Even the little worm will one day transcend the senses and reach God. No life will be a failure. There is no such thing as failure in the universe.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">More than listening to a hundred lectures or delivering them to others, offering one act as genuine service attracts the Grace of God.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We should not aspire for acclaim and praise from those around us, but do service only to secure the Grace of God and not for any other reward from any one.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bury bad thoughts under good ones. Then the bad ones will just fade away and be forgotten.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Living is not enough; it has no value by itself. It is the motives, the feelings, the thoughts, the attitudes that prompt the day to day life that matters.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Secure spiritual bliss first and then try to convey it to those who thirst. When the tank is dry, how can the taps give water?</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Always try to put yourself in the position of the other and judge your action against the background. Then you will not be wrong.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Make the mind, the voice and the actions agree in harmony. That is the right way of life.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Impurity is a mere superimposition under which the real nature of man has been hidden.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Where divinity is sought after, one ought always to behave in the spirit of Love, devoid of the slightest trace of hate, envy and anger. When one cultivates the inner look, one attains the conviction of the basic equality of all.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What is heard has to be pondered over. What is pondered over has to be put into practice. It is only when all three are accomplished that the realization of Bliss can be attained.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The secret of perfect health lies in keeping the mind always cheerful - never worried, never hurried, never borne down by any fear, thought or anxiety.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The pure heart is the best mirror for the reflection of Truth. So all these disciplines are for the purification of the heart. As soon as it is pure, all truths flash upon it in a minute.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">O Lord, take my love and let it flow in fullness of devotion to Thee. &nbsp;<br> O Lord, take my hands and let them work incessantly for Thee. &nbsp;<br> O Lord, take my soul and let it be merged in oneness with Thee. &nbsp;<br> O Lord, take my mind and thoughts and let them be in tune with Thee. &nbsp;<br> O Lord, take my everything and let me be an instrument for thy work.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Religion is three-fourths character. Only those who preserve character can be pronounced truly religious.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Desire destroys devotion, anger destroys wisdom, greed destroys work - hence these bad qualities must be sacrificed. With good and sweet words, keeping desires under check and control (for ultimate removal), one should start on the path of sacrifice.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Man derives all the joy and peace that he needs from within himself and not from sources outside himself. So the best spiritual discipline is: strengthen the inward vision.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anything that helps you maintain unruffled equanimity is right action.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">True love expands the self; attachment contracts it.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Moderation in temper is virtue; Moderation in principle is a vice.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The harder the circumstances, the more trying the environment, the stronger are those who come out of those circumstances.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That which happens physically on the outside in terms of actions is not of major importance. What is important is that which comes from inside.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This body is the residence of God. The food you take is the offering you make to him. Your act of bathing is the ceremonial bathing of Him who is in You. The ground you walk on is His domain. The joy you gain is His gift. The grief you experience is His lesson. Remember Him ever, in sun and rain, day and night, asleep and awake.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Offer service and receive love. This is the recipe for experiencing Divinity. Our love should not be confined to our kith and kin. It must extend beyond the family to society as a whole, then to the nation at large and finally embrace the whole world.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whatever books you may read, you cannot realize the Divine merely by intellectual effort. One must put it into practice. That sense of oneness can only be promoted by the practice of love and not by any other means.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is not what you have achieved that is important. It is the broadness of heart that has motivated you to do work that counts. Being broad minded with a selfless attitude, humility and obedience, you should try to share the difficulties of others around you. It is the purity of heart that is more important than the magnitude of the work itself.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our relationships are heart to heart relationships. Ours is a business of love, not a business of money or materials.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the progress of humanity, work alone is not adequate, but the work should be associated with love, compassion, right conduct, truthfulness and sympathy. Without the above qualities, selfless service cannot be performed.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">God will not ask you when and where you did service? He will ask, with what motive did you do it? What was the intention that prompted you? You may weigh the service and boast of its quantity. But God seeks quality - the quality of heart, the purity of mind, the holiness of motive.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Living with God is education &nbsp;<br> Living for God is Service &nbsp;<br> Living in God is Realization</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Reform the body, reconstruct the mind, regulate the way of living, then, the country will become automatically strong and prosperous.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before you speak, think -Is it necessary? Is it true? Is it kind? Will it hurt anyone? &nbsp;<br> Will it improve on the silence?</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first step in the Sadhana is the cleansing of the speech. Talk sweet without anger. Do not boast of your scholarship or attainments. Be humble, eager to serve; conserve your speech. Practice silence. That will save you from squabbles, frittering thoughts and faction.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Spend a few minutes every morning and evening in the Silence of your own shrine or home; spend them with the highest of all the Powers that you know of. Be in His elevating and Inspiring company; worship Him mentally; offer unto Him all the work you do; you will come out of the silence nobler and more heroic than when you went in.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Forget the harm that anyone has done to you, and forget the good that you have done to others.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is only one royal road for the spiritual journey...Love</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Be Silent yourself, that will induce Silence in others. Do not fall into the habit of shouting, talking long and loud. Reduce contacts to the minimum. Carry with you an atmosphere of quiet contemplation, wherever you happen to be. The less you talk, the more will become your mental power. With the increase in your mental capacity, there will be increase in your power of discrimination too. Consequently, you will give up "individual discrimination". Because of this, you will begin to consider the good of the world at large rather than your own individual welfare. You must cultivate such broad feelings from this young age itself. </font> </p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Learn the value of Silence, of Namasmarana, of Bhajan, of Japa, of Dhyana, of single-minded remembrance of the Lord, of the association with spiritually kin. These will stand you in good stead, when distress assails you.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The voice of God can be heard in the region of your heart when the tongue is stilled and the storm is tilled and the waves are calm. There will be no temptations for others to shout when you talk to them in whispers. Set the level of the tone yourself; as low as possible, as high as necessary to reach the outermost boundary of the circle you are addressing. Conserve sound, since it is the treasure of the element akasa, an emanation from God Himself. Reason can prevail only when arguments are advanced without the whipping up of sound. Silence is the speech of the spiritual seeker. Soft sweet speech is the expression of genuine love. Hate screeches, fear squeals, conceit trumpets. But love sings lullabies. It soothes. It applies balm. Practice the vocabulary of love; unlearn the language of hate and contempt.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Silence is the only language of the realized. Practice moderation in speech. That will help you in many ways. It will develop Prema, for most misunderstandings and factions arise out of carelessly spoken words. When the foot slips, the wound can be healed; but when the tongue slips, the wound it causes in the heart of another will fester for life. The tongue is liable to four big errors: uttering falsehood, scandalizing, finding fault with others, and excessive speech. All these have to be avoided if there is to be Shanthi for the individual as well as for society.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Good works never languish for want of funds; the Lord will come to their rescue. Only it may take some time; do not lose heart... You should not collect money in devious ways. Help should come from pious hearts, from well-earned money, from persons who know and appreciate the purpose for which they give. That is why I oppose all benefit shows, where you tempt people with a dance or a drama or a film and collect money for your pet plan.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In all effort, if you trust in a Higher Power, which is ready to come to your help, work is made easy. This comes out of Bhakti, reliance on the Lord, the source of all Power. When you travel by train, you have only to purchase the ticket, enter the proper train and take a seat, leaving the rest to the engine. Why should you carry the bed and trunk on your head? So too put your trust in the Lord and carry on to the best of your ability.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You have been born because you did not pass in certain subjects; there is some balance of experience, which you must acquire to complete the course. If you get convinced that your true nature is the Atma, then you have finished the course and 'passed'.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You should see that no dirt settles upon the mind; that is to say, you should move about in such company that dirt is avoided. Falsehood, injustice, indiscipline, cruelty, hate -- these form the dirt; Sathya, Dharma, Shanthi, Prema -- these form the clean elements. If you inhale the pure air of these latter, your mind will be free from evil bacilli and you will be mentally sturdy and physically strong.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The year becomes new, the day becomes holy, when you sanctify it by spiritual discipline, not otherwise.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Do not crave for recognition and respect from others; crave rather for winning grace from the Lord.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">God is love, live in love.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Lord will be watching with a thousand eyes the least activity of man to discover any slight trace of selfless love sweetening it.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A sound mind ensures a sound body; a sound body ensures a sound mind.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The body will shine if the character is fine; service of man and worship of God will preserve its charm.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The peace that pervades the heart can never be shaken for any reason; only peace of this kind is worthy of the name.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Love all beings; that is enough.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The grace of God is like insurance.
