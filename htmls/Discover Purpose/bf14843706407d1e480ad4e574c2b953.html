                 <!-- Anonymous --> <span class="author" style="text-align:left;"><strong>by: Anonymous </strong></span> <br> <br><span class="subBodyText"> Please read this because I really need your help!!!<br>My name is Alfred Jones and I?m a college student that is majoring in criminal justice and I also play football. I received a letter in the mail telling me that I can?t come back to school because I have a balance over $16,000.00 from my previous year. I tried to get loans to cover it but I keep getting denied even with my mother as a cosigner. I start thinking what life would be like with no education and I didn?t want that so I start thinking big. I start buying lotto tickets, scratch offs, and even asking everybody I know for money. Everybody tell me to ask my uncles and aunts for help and that?s when I tell them I did and nothing happen. The funny thing is that I have a rich uncle on my daddy?s side and instead of him helping me he rather tell me how much money something cost that he own or how much money he has in the bank. That?s ok I?m not gone give up yet. I start think about what I have that?s worth anything. At this point I?ve pawn my television, DVD player, and GPS. At this point I?m running out of options and the only thing I have left of any value is my laptop and the title to my 1993 Buick. I really miss school and football. I wish there was such of thing call a money tree because if there was I?ll be growing them in my backyard. I pray every night for a miracle to happen. I know its people out there similar or worse than mine but I?m willing to do whatever it takes to get the money for my education. I just hope I get the money by Dec. so I can pay the school off so I can register for fall semester in January. If you can help me giving me $1,$5,$10,$20,$50,$100 or any way you can I would be so thankful and appreciate everything you do for me. Thank You and God Bless?<br><br></span> </td>

God does not read emails...and what is his email address, by the way? Then I just wrote "God help me", and there it was...messages to God from all over America. I felt embarrassed to ask for help anymore. So many people out there needed help. I only felt the urge to wipe my embarrassment by asking you my Dear God to fulfill those people's prayers. Please, my Dear God, give those people all the things that will make them better and happy and loving to their relatives, friends and neighbors; a house, a passionate job, a great and compassionate friend, a loving husband or wife, happy children, good health, great slim bodies for all Americans. And happiness and energy and creativity to help our world, our life on the earth to evolve into peaceful and loving and beautiful existence. Thank you my Dear God. I love You. KC</span> </td>

I thought when I accepted Jesus as my saviour, You become my Father, and I finally get closer to you.<br>Then why do I have to be alone for over 40 years and I can't meet my soul mate and desperately longing to live in the place that I am dreaming for so long? Please lead me into the blessed land and give me a chance to glorify you by doing your work... I don't want to feel so useless.<br>Please use me Father for your work... let me work for you and get the wisdom from you. I want to be blessed by you.

To help my sister get anything and everything she could ever ask for. She deserves it. In your name lord I pray to you.</span> </td>

I never achieved anything in life because I never tried hard enough. I've been average or below average all along. Now with all that my father has done and is doing- I hate him - He's provided for our material comforts but killed all my spirit and love for him - the way he harasses me and my mother - I want to hurt him so! I love my mother - but since I've never achieved anything great in life, I'm not able to help her in any way. In fact I'm dependent on her myself. I keep longing for my One-time Boyfriend who doesn't even care about me anymore-Why can't you make it stop? Why do I feel jealous of his new girlfriend? Why can't I get over him?<br>My life is wasted so far. I'm useless to everyone around.I've blamed you for everything all along-you know that. I'm sorry if I disrespected you-I just felt justified then.Not working hard is my mistake but what about my DAD?? Did I deserve that? What sort of God or DAD does that??Now I'm lost in life. Can't you forgive me for my mistakes and help?? Am I undeserving STILL? Haven't you ignored me and my mom long enough? I've wanted to kill myself since the age of 17 - Am I damned to stay confused and angry forever? Haven't I endured enough? I'd like an answer. Suicide and murder are both sins. Please don't drive me to either or both. I want to be happy and make my mom happy. I'll work for it from this instant. Please guide me. Please. Trust me this one time. Tell me what to do. I don't want to be like this God, please. I want to be all I can be and make my mother proud.<br>Help Me.</span> </td>

I am out of work for 5 months, still longing to have a life partner. Loneliness and jobless life is wearing me down so bad, I really don't know what to do. What do I have to do to get a blessing from you my Father? I have faith in you and Jesus, I thank you for my salvation through Jesus and I truly want to belong to you always.<br>Father, I am not strong, smart enough, that is why I need your help and your guidance in my life. I have been praying for the same things for 5 months now. I am also seeking Your Kingdom and Heavenly things and I am not merely looking for the food which will go bad. Please look at my heart and find my sincereness in my prayer.<br>You created me,and You know my ability and capacity to do something even before I know for myself. I really don't know what to do when there is no job available to me, and I don't know the reason for being alone all my life, Father. I want to ask You, is it my family curse to be alone? As You know, I was born alone, all my life events I had to go through alone, Father, now I am really tired and sad, I can't go on like this anymore. I really need Your help, without your help, I will be nothing.<br>Where do I have to turn to, when there is no family or relative and friends to lean on?<br>With what purpose I was born alone and what is the hidden purpose to be in this miserable situation? What lesson do I have to learn? I want to spend my time worthwhile, but for last 5 months, I felt I was losing my mind, if I don't get any help from You, Father.... I will be crushed so badly. Please show mercy on me, I know I can't be the proud child for you, but I do have faith in You and Jesus, even though when I was in emergency cases many times before, I cried out and asked You to help me, and remembered You and Jesus. I'm sorry Father, I didn't obey all the rules you instructed in Bible for me to do, that is why I am asking you to forgive me and give me the chance again.<br>Could you please show me you grace and mercy on me? Help! I didn't know I have to beg you for blessing... I don't know whether it is right or not to beg you for blessing. I'd rather beg You for blessing than begging others to help me and support me with money. I am desperately begging you and asking you to help me.<br>In Jesus name I pray this with all my heart, Amen.</span> </td>

I work had and treat people with respect only to be treated like some kind of freak? I have never done anything so bad that I have never once in my life been really happy? I have asked you into my life when i was younger and never found peace or happiness... if your real I am a terrible christian because i have no idea what to do.. I tried church different types nothing worked felt like an outsider everytime? Is it because I have a lazy eye maybe I am a freak but I try to be good.. get treated like crap at work every single day? I don't even have one close friend and my mother never liked me? I am not sure what I am doing wrong I keep asking for help and still I get nothing.. People use me I get angry ... I am angry hurt and confused and you won't come to me and help me I guess maybe I am just wishing you were there???? Not coming back just found this site felt like expressing myself nothing helps so no sense in coming back .... Let me add ( but I guess you know this already)I even have thanked you for little things like my job even if I hate it I have one .. my legs so I can walk but what good are these things if you are never happy not even 1 day in a hundred days? I just want to be happy for once I want to do something meaningful I feel so worthless... </span> </td>

I believe that Jesus died in my place allowing my sins to be washed away and that with Jesus in my heart I will be born again and join you in heaven some day.

Lord shield them and protect them and let them feel your love about them so that they may come to you and give their hearts to you.

I have lost everything due to my gambling habits over the past 10 years. I lost my wife, house, savings, friends, job and most importantly, my relationship with you God. I filed for bankruptcy and am completely broke now. The sad part is I have a great career in the health care field but still lost everything. I lost all my friends who I borrowed money from and can't pay them back. I have let down family and friends and my ex-wife who is now looking for a place to live because I lost our house. I cannot live with this guilt. It weighs on me daily without end. I do not gamble anymore at all but the financial disaster I created, I cannot overcome. My ex-friends call me on a daily basis asking for their money. I try to find ways to pay them back but I just cannot. I have literally $1 to my name right now. Lord, I am at rock bottom and maybe that's where you wanted me just for me to come back to you. The past year, I have not smiled or had a day of rest. My soul and heart cannot find solace or peace. Please Lord, speak to me what do I do now? I cannot afford to eat, buy gas, pay rent anymore...I can't do this much longer. Please reveal your will for me soon Lord. In Jesus Name I pray.

After loosing my job of 10 years, I feel there are no prospects out there, and every day it gets harder and harder to find a good job to replace my income. Divine Father, I am not sure what to do next or where to turn. I feel helpless, hopeless and without direction as to what my, and my family's future holds. For the first time in my adult life I find myself unemployed for and extended period of time, and I feel so much despair, sadness and lost in the woods. I need your loving hand &amp; direction dear Lord. I need you more then I ever had. Please help me. Please show what path to follow. Please show me the light, and that there is hope. I need you in my heart dear Lord. I need to find peace in you. I know I am probably the last person that deserves your love &amp; compassion, but please know that I do love you heavenly Father, even though I rarely show it. Dear God, please help me find a new, good job which allows me to provide for my wife and kids, which you have blessed me with. Please help me be the providing father that I should be for my family. Please hear my prayer Lord, I am calling out for you. Please do not forsake me Lord. I Love you God. I ask you this in the name of your son Jesus Christ, Amen.</span> </td>

His wife, daughter abused his pain medication and he began drinking to mask his pain and anger and it only made things worse. they need help to Lord. My nephews: one who cannot seem to find work and his brother who is a schizophrenic will soon be without a place to live and their father who is a millinaire will not help either one of them. My sister's husband just lost his job after 16 years of service after they bought a new home and I had been living with her but she has asked me to go somewhere else because they have found another tenant who can help them more financially. so here I am with no place to go. I had a heart attack in May with no medical insurance and now I am burdened with over 30,000 dollars in medical debt. My sister is addicted to oxycontin's and there's more Lord. I believe that God can do anything and I know I need to wait on the Lord, but I am so tired and weary heavenly Father. I wish that Jesus would come back today, but I know you'll send Him again when it's time. I know the power in His wonderful name and I am learning to speak His name out loud and gather strength and courage. Please have mercy on my family, Heavenly Father. I thank you for all you have done for me and my family and I ask for your help, love, grace, and protection. With you all things are possible. In the blessed name of Jesus I ask these things</span> </td>

I and my son both need jobs bad for we have been searching for such a long time. I know you have something for us that will be the perfect jobs that will last me until I retire and will give my son a good future. Please bring jobs soon for my money is running out and I and my son will have no place to go and no money to live on. I have almost used up all my retirement savings and need a job that will enable me to meet my living expenses and enable me to put enough money back into my retirement so I can retire someday. God you say you will never leave or forsake your children, but sometimes I feel you are so far away. I know that many times we want things to happen now, but I know that your timing is perfect. I'm patiently waiting for a answer Lord. I don't want to leave my children someday with nothing and I want to be able to provide a good home. Thank you for my salvation and for all the times you have helped me and my children in the past. I also pray for each person that has posted a prayer for your help and that you would in Jesus Precious Name meet their needs and requests as well. Give us all your strength and peace that you Father are in control and are working things out for our good. Also, please help my daughter to come back to you for she has fallen away. Please help her to see your love for her and redirect her life so she will live for you the way she should. I pray for wisdom and knowledge for me and my children as well. Forgive me where I have failed you and help me to be the christian woman you would have me to be. Help me with my health so I can continue to care for my son. Thanks for everything you provide and I love you. Amen</span> </td>

Although I have been threw alot before now this has been the worst 365 year of my whole life. I don't understand. Why so much pain? My early life took a bad turn although i was a good person and was always kind to others, thinking of everyone else's feelings before mine only to be put down, let down and treated badly. While in a deep depression you sent me someone to walk with me, yes i do know, i thank you father for the people you put into my path, thanmk you. Now in this day in time, you know dear lord i was lonely and i asked for someone to love me because i felt like i had no one and you once again sent someone to walk with me and i thank you father. Everynight I would pray and ask you to order my steps, not asking for material things even though we didn't have much money I asked for guidence. 9/7/09 my car caught on fire, 9/20/09 the only one i feel has ever loved me and the one i love was taken away from me,i lost my house and after moving to georgia to get away and getting a job, my cousin put me out with only 10 days to move, after living with someone i barely know i found somewhere to stay only to lose my job two days later. so now i am back living with my mother, I can't find a job, lord help me, and now my love is convicted of murder in which he did not commit and sentenced to 99 years on 9/05/2010. I have cried so much. my heart is overwhelmed. i don't have any friends to talk to it is just me, all alone. i feel you with me when i am sad but i am still stuck. i need a job so badly. i need a murderer found and a good person set free lord. i am depressed and helpless, hopeless and in dispair. if only i had work. i am without anything, everything is gone except my life. </span> </td>

I know I was wrong to marry a Muslim man and I didn't listen to your warning signs. <br><br>Today, after more than two months since he told me to leave, I have nothing. You know my circumstances and how I desperately need life to change for me and him both. You know how I pray for his salvation, but mostly how I feel so lost without the material things I gathered through my adult life. He is keeping them away from me and you know how badly I need them to start over.<br><br>God, please show me the way through Your Word and through the guidance of your Holy Spirit. Please show me what to do and what not to do. <br><br>Please forgive me for my anger and anxiety. Please forgive me that I lash out to you at times and become angry with You. Please forgive me for my failure to be patient and God, please forgive my husband for the unfairness he has chosen to act out towards me.<br><br>Thank you Father for giving me so kind of hope each day. You know how I wake up each morning with the most helpless feeling of yet another day without him, another day in an empty room and another day of mountains to climb.<br><br>God, please send people my way who can pray with me and strengthen me by their faith and experiences of Your grace.<br><br>I pray this in Jesus Name<br>Amen</span> </td>

May we all put on the full armor of God as it says in Ephesians 6 to protect us. God help me to seek your will and not my will.

I really could care less, that's not why I'm here today. I've made some pore decisions believing and trusting people and that includes family. I recently married a man only to find out he never cared about me at all. Now I have no money because of him. He lives under a false identity and screwed up my bank account. He is a federal criminal and was in jail recently for some of his crimes. He was released a month ago and now he's missing in action. He lied from beginning to end on top of that he treated me so bad. I just want my money from him and that would help alot right now. I'm not working with no money because of him. I will never get married again but I will always love. God has forgivin me and I don't blame myself I just need a miracle from GOD immediately because don't think I can last much longer. It's been 5months since I've been dealing with this. Father GOD (YAHU) Please help me!!!</span> </td>

But i think having a baby is a gift in life. May be the baby will bring a new light to your lives, also think of people whodont have children.. I personally know few such people and i know the pain they are going through. A baby is always a gift from God, so accept him/her. It won't cost you much to feed a small baby, and you can find new pleasures in life. Afterall, the feeling of being a mother is great!! So be happy, all your problems will be over soon and you will live happily with your husband, and of course, with your baby!!</span> </td>

I am suppose to use by gift to touch others, change lifes, stir up the souls of others. In 2007, when I was working, I asked that you find a way for me to write. You answered, rather than using the time to do you will. I have focused on irrelevant things have distracted me. I am asking you Lord . . . I am begging you . . . To help me stay focused on writing, believing that I can do it, and makin gyou proud of me. When I die, I want to hear you say "WELL DONE MY FAITHFUL SERVANT." Help me to balance husband, children, finances, and house. I am scared . . . terrified . . . I need you to help me fulfill my purpose and keep my lifestyle. Please Father, please. Help me.</span> </td>

Don't forget sometimes he may have to close one of those other doors to get yours open. Do you ever wonder how some people get a job that replaced someone else?

Like many others, I too have had difficulties in finding a job. I've been to several interviews but none with offers. I'm starting to lose faith and fall into depression. I don't want to be in that place. So God, I have turned to you and hope that you can hear my prayers. I want to have the strength to keep on moving and hope that I will overcome these obstacles. I know that sometimes in life you have to struggle in order to learn what's important and I believe I have. Now, I want to find a job I would be able to enjoy and follow your guidance. I know you have always been there for me and I will not give up on you. Please help me. To the rest of you, I will keep you in my prayers... Amen.</span> </td>

I have 4 other courses and I'm waiting to hear from the teachers if they will let me stay enrolled. If not I loose so much money. I will not be considered full time and will have to pay loans I do not have money for. Please! I just can't go through another minute scared like this! I can't sleep. I can't eat. I need something. I need everything to be okay. Please, I need hope right now! I even bought a lottery ticket because I needed some hope to get out of this. Please forgive me, please get me out of this.

I knew you would hear my prayers. You always do. There were so many time that I wanted to give up and was falling into depression but I knew that if I let myself fall I would not be able to get myself back up. I knew you would not give up on me so I couldn't give up on myself. I want everyone to know that God did answer my prayers. I was also on here not too long ago asking for guidance and he has answered my prayers. Please don't give up on yourself or whatever is that you are going through. God is there for you no matter what. I too will keep everyone in my prayers and hope that you too will find the right path. <br> <br>God Bless</span> </td>

I cannot take back my words but I can be more careful in future. You know me completely and you know how I've struggled with my anger and disappointments.... Have patience with me Lord and wait for me to be worthy of your calling. Please help me Lord to make things alright...... yes, I admit that I've sinned and this sin is costing me and my family a lot of pain. But Lord, please let your grace save us and help us to bear, may this times bring me humility and the wisdom to forgive as I ask of you for forgiveness.

I want you back so much God please help me you say you hear everyone's prayer so I am keeping you to that!

We pray we cry and we question God sometimes. It is not wrong to question God or sometimes get angry, because God does understand, providing we never give up on God and lose our faith. <br> <br>God will never forsake us, or abandon us, if we seek we will find, God will never ever leave anyone that seeks Him. Then we ask God why is He not helping us? <br> <br>The answer is simple, all of us that live on this planet, there is enough money and food for all of us, yet some people are greedy and want more and more yet forget to share with the less fortunate, and those people will be judged one day. <br> <br>So we should try to get our fellowmen to help us all, which we know will not happen, some do some don't, but God shouldn't be blamed, man should be blamed, full stop. <br> <br>It is disgusting how some people just think of themselves and no one else, and how much more they want, why? because satin rules on earth, but God will protect in the new life. <br> <br>Everyone must try to do their best to look for work and to survive, and i know it's difficult, because everyone's situation is different. I don't have the answers and i cannot speak for God, but God does love you <br> <br>God Bless <br> <br>Rodney </span> </td>

I know people are worse off than me in other parts of the world so I am sorry to you that I have to type this and feel sorry for my self. I'm sick of my family living not even paycheck to paycheck barely even making 1500 a month. I want to finish school but I feel like at this point, with our debt even to the electricity company it may be time to quit. I want to finish so bad I have only 3 semesters left but i don't want to ruin my credit- defaulting on my credit card be evicted or have my electricity shut off. These are all my worst fears. I feel so embarassed because my family lives in this small 1 bed room apartment. I mean look at my 2 year old, she sleeps in a closet! I only blame myself for having my child too soon I don't blame you at all this is my doing. Can I have a do over or something? Had I known that one day where she would have to sleep I would have made sure my husband and I would have waited. I need your help. Please bless my husband with a better job so I can stay in school or at least bless me with a job with more stable hours. Something. I also want a house badly but that's impossible right now. Please we need help. My husband won't admit it but we do. He tries so hard. I love you. Please before I end my life. <br> <br>Your daughter</span> </td>

No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. <br> 5 “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. 6 If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. 7 If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 8 This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. <br> <br> 9 “As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. 10 If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commands and remain in his love. 11 I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. 12 My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. 13 Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. 14 You are my friends if you do what I command. 15 I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you. 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you. 17 This is my command: Love each other. <br> <br>1 John 4:20 <br>If anyone says, "I love God," yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.</span> </td>

I ask you earnestly, please don't let your faith be shaken and moved. For God created everything in this world, the people at you work, school, in your family. Every thing invisible and visible, the diseases, jobs, and modern technology. He can help anyone in any problem, JUST BELIEVE, if you can wake up eveyday and have breath to breathe. Then you have a purpose in life. He has given us the secret to life, in the Bible. In the books of provers, Pslams 35-45, and the books written by paul. Please, I beg you to not give up. God has not sent you upon this earth to sin, cry, or be depressed. SO i will pray for you, but you too must pray and believe. I am 18 years old, and I believe GOD can help everyone because he created everyone. From the moment you are born to the day you die, he is with you, but you must believe in him. </span> </td>

There is nothing that God can't do and or will not do on your behalf. Have you ever thought what you have done for God Lately. We always find a need to call upon God when we are in need. God is always there he has never left you and remember he is the creater of the universe. Pray about it and let the situation go. If you are going to worry about it don't pray. God has alway answered you prayers not when you wanted but right on time. If you never ask God for anything ask him for a clean heart and everything will be alright. Michael B.</span> </td>

                 <!-- Anonymous --> <span class="author" style="text-align:left;"><strong>by: Anonymous </strong></span> <br> <br><span class="subBodyText"> I have read all the comments on this web site and my heart goes out to each and every one of them. I never realised there was so much hurt out there. I did not realise that things that do not bother me bother other people. It must be horrible looking for a job, with no money, it must be horrible not having a loving family, it must be horrible loosing a girlfriend or boyfriend. I must admit I have had some terrible things in my life, BUT i do not look back at the past I look to the future. I think we cannot change situations and that is a fact, so we must just face reality and get on with things. I believe that for those that have lost a girlfriend or boyfriend (that happened to me also and at the time I was devestated) there is someone else out there for you to love, believe me. Come on we have only one life! you are very special to GOD, he made you and loves you and will never let you down (believe me), just keep praying to him and he will answer your prayer, perhaps not immediately, but he will. Try thinking of other people besides yourself, that is what I did, then you forget your problems doing good works for others it is wonderful you will never look back. I know it may be hard if you have no confidence in yourself, but please try. You are important in this life, do not give in. all my love mary</span> </td>

I don’t know how I developed so much sadness inside of my soul, Lord please help me, because I cannot do this on my own strength. I want peace and show me the path I am supposed to walk on. You’re the only one that can see my sadness and not judge me for it. Lord please, I beg of you to help me help myself. I don’t want to be like this anymore. I don’t want to be miserable in my own skin. I don’t want to keep crying over these same things. I want to be strong. Lord, please help me get past this pain. Lord, I am so tired that all I want to is close my eyes and be at peace but I am filled with sorrow. I feel like my soul is incomplete, and that something is missing in my life. Lord, hold me in the palm of your hands and shield me from the darkness that tries to take over me. My heart is heavy, But you know them all, see them all, and feel what I feel. My Father in Heaven please have mercy upon my soul and guide me through this lifetime. Give me strength Lord, for I am weak. I want to just give up and let it all go. I want it all to stop, the fear, the sadness, the pain. I want it to stop Lord, I am weary from this all and I need to you to hold me in your arms and heal me. I think that I am holding on to all this baggage because I don’t know how to lay my burdens before you Lord. Cover me in your beauty and surround me with your spirit. Pray for me. Love me. Take me as your child and hold me. I am tired Lord, the kind of tired that will not leave me without your help Lord. Thank you Lord, for loving me and bringing people into my life that will see my need, and will help me get to where I need to go. Lord, I pray for all those people out there who are like me. Who are hurt, in pain and who need you, take them Lord and help them get through it as you will help me get through this. I ask you Lord to forgive me for my sins and for staying by my side. Lord clear my mind of foolish thoughts, and give me the courage to seek what I need and want. Bring people into my life that will love me for me and take me as I am. ~Amen <br> <br></span> </td>

I have moved all over the US with my husband's job. He was unemployed for quite some time and we had little income. Financially, we are a little better now. However, I am very lonely. Neither or us have good friends. We would love friends. I had two friends at work, one is older and I think is only friendly out of pity. The other one stabbed me in the back. I forgave her gossiping and tried to forgive her cruelness. I emailed her to work things out and she tried to get me fired at work. I have prayed so much. For years I have wanted one true friend, but have found out that when we have been in trouble anyone who was a friend left (so they were not true friends). I am not a saint, but I think I am a good person. I cry at the thought of hurting anyone. I have worked at my current job over 10 years. I have been a hard-working, loyal employee and because of one friend betraying me and her sister (my boss) betraying me I have gone from the title of great employee to terrible. I need a new job. I can't leave my current position until I find one. I need a friend. For years I have prayed for one. I guess I am not meant to have a friend. Anyone who doesn't have a true friend, please pray for me. One prayer may make the difference.</span> </td>

So is that the new theory that it does not last and is not the same? I asked for a husband and no another boyfriend we were together 2 years and now God I'm back to square one. 40 is soon and maybe it's not your will for me. Please I want to serve you God and I don't want anything unless it's blessed by you. Help me to reach you God. Help me to be strong. Help me to do your will Lord.

I am ashamed. And now even more because it takes me losing my job to seek your guidance. As you know I have gone from job to job unable to hold one for an extended period of time. I sometimes believe it is due to the fact that I haven't found my true calling. GOD, please guide me! Why am I here? How may I serve you and this world in which you have made? <br>Please help me discover my passion again. I am so lonely and lost but I know I am not alone. <br>Please help me find employment again.

I go at him with a vengeance and end up hurting him, myself and my little princess in the process. I don’t want to hate anymore, I don’t want to hurt or hurt my family anymore. <br>Please heal me of all these years of hurt that I have suffered so that I can stop hurting others. <br>Give me the tolerance to ignore his inhumanness...help me love him...help him love me... <br>I want to make this work for my daughter; I want to make this work for me. <br>Father just stay with me, keep your hand on my head and you are my only friend. <br> <br></span> </td>

                 <!-- Anonymous --> <span class="author" style="text-align:left;"><strong>by: Anonymous </strong></span> <br> <br><span class="subBodyText"> Dear God, <br> <br>I've been praying and crying to you for months and years now. I don't know what is wrong with me. I find jobs, but then I get fired from them. I am close to 50, and I have been fired from almost every job I've ever had. After this last job loss in September 2010, I've lost all heart. I also found out 2 1/2 years ago that my husband is gay, and I worry all the time that he will leave me, even though he tells me he loves me and wants things to work out. I feel so alone, &amp; I can't keep offering myself up to these heartless employers that don't care about your financial obligations or your spirit. I feel so crushed by all this. I haven't had the heart to look for a job at all, &amp; have been subsisting on unemployment, which is so unfair to my family. We have been late on the mortgage for the last 2 months, and I still can't find the courage to look for a job. I've been selling things on ebay, but everyone is so hard up financially that it isn't helping enough to keep the bills paid. Even the temp agencies haven't kept me working and I gave up after the last assignment ended in December just before Christmas. You gave me a good brain, and I'm good at many different things, but I have no solid way to make a living. I want to go back to school, but the finances aren't available without a job. I'm so depressed, and wish I was dead. Then I read all these prayers, and I feel so badly for all of us suffering souls. I feel grateful for what I still have, but fear that I will soon be like so many - no job, no money, loss of home, my marriage, &amp; the respect of family. I feel like such a failure at life. How can I go on? I love you deeply Lord, and I put my life in your hands. I have been doing so for years. I wish I could solve this one problem - finding a career where I can use the talents you've given me and make a useful contribution with them. Why did you give me this brain and no obvious way to use it successfully? No one cares that I can sew, or paint or make lovely jewelry or write poems &amp; stories. I just feel that this keeps coming up - I'm worthless and there's nowhere for me to fit in - no employer appreciates me or my work, no matter how devoted I am or how hard I work. I'm a sinner. Please forgive me and help me Lord Jesus. I can't help myself and I can't find the courage to go on. <br>I know this sounds like so much whining, but I just don't know what to do anymore. Please help me Lord - if you don't help me, then there's no one left in the universe that will, for you are my all and my only reason to live and love. Thank you for all you have done for me - I wish I was smart enough to have figured it out better I guess.</span> </td>

I don't understand my God who I thought I once understood. Financial problems constantly appear and assault me. My people relationships and search for a soulmate have created more anguish no matter what I do and how often I cry out to you. So confused. Rent is late again and my amt. due gets larger every month and I live in a foreign land without much knowledge of the language. So many trials mounting. I know you are a God of miracles...why do you hold back your blessings of consequence? I want to be your loyal servant and witness but I can't properly serve you without the resources to do your bidding. That disturbs me most of all. Even the physical church requires needed moneys to exist and function in this world. What have I done to draw down this fire from you? I live morally and value wise the same as before and I am your true believer...and have accepted you as my Lord and Savior many years before. Show yourself to me please. How long will I be abandoned by you? </span> </td>

I have so much to be grateful for, but I have no means of moving foreword. I have no money. I can't go active. I can't find nor keep a civilian job. I can't make my payments. I have no phone. I have an hour a day on the internet at the local library. I have NO family. My fiancee's family will be leaving the country next month and it will be up to us to support ourselves. She found a job but I can't communicate with her any more because I cannot afford a phone. The only shelter I have is by sheer luck that the Navy hasn't kicked me out of their barracks yet. I have so much and yet I have nothing and I have no means of gaining anything. I'll do anything Lord. I'll sell my car. I would give my left arm to go Active. Anything God. Please. I need help. I have nothing left and I am out of time. Please, God. Please help me.</span> </td>
