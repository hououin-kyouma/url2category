               <h2>Alicia Isaacs Howes (Director Of Learning and Development; Master Teacher and Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>I received my first Akashic reading in 2000 and not only received healing from the pain of a miscarriage but also the knowing that this is what I was meant to do for others. I learned how to work in the Akashic Records later that year and have been blessed to help others by accessing their Records since then. In 2011, I felt compelled to study the Soul Journeys Method with Jennifer. Since then, the clarity of information that comes through has increased and the perspective shifting and healings that clients create have expanded with a graceful, almost magical ease. I'm very glad that I was guided to work with Jennifer and trusted my heart to study something that I thought I already knew pretty well.</p> 
               <p>After receiving that first Akashic/Soul Story reading and knowing that this was what I was to do for others, I started to flex my right brain and heart more than I had for many years. I gave my first Soul Story reading in December 2000 and stepped onto a path of truth, grace, joy and alignment to who I really am. I absolutely love my clients and what we do together and delight in making a positive difference every day. It's pure joy to see people like you light up from the inside out as they connect to their true essence and live their life from that clear, loving place.</p>

               <h2>Pascale Landriault (Director of French Services; Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>Before meeting Jennifer and being introduced to the Soul Journeys Akashic Record Certification Program, I was at a crossroads in my coaching business and knew something needed to transform but I wasn't quite sure what.</p> 
               <p>I responded to my inner voice calling me to join Jennifer's Intensive Akashic Records Training in Sedona Arizona. Deep inside of me, I knew this would be the beginning of a new direction and of a shift in the way I was running my business and my life. And indeed, it was! Before the end of the training, I had decided to take on private coaching with Jennifer and started to work in my Records on an on-going basis creating major mindset transformations.</p> 
               <p>Since then, I have a renewed trust in the Universe, in the connection to my essence and have found the way of my soul. Consulting in my Records has empowered me to make better choices, to get out of my own way, to see the truth about who I really am and to manifest it. I am now able to see the possibilities in different situations and to create what I want. The direction is now clear in my business and my life. Jennifer is not only an excellent teacher; she is a class coach and a great model for anyone that wants to walk their talk and manifest their full potential.</p> 
               <p>As a Certified Akashic Records Consultant, I am passionate about helping other people see their full potential and most of all discover the different possibilities of how to manifest it on this planet.</p>

               <h2>Eva Lukacs (Certified Teacher And Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>My Journey with the Akashic Record began May 2010 taking Level One. I found it powerfully awakening. Immediately my life began to evolve as I allowed myself to release tribal energy and amazingly, new, beautiful souls entered my life. I have continued my journey with Jennifer in a variety of programs and now am blessed to have her as a private coach. Through each encounter I open up a part of me that I've never known existed. Many times I am meeting myself for the first time and it is with Jennifer's unique intuitiveness and gentle ways to create the shifts that served my highest good that I feel I am now living the life I was blessed with. My miraculous discovery of passion for becoming an Akashic Record Consultant was during Level III . Here I realized the contribution I can be to others in finding the freedom to infinite possibilities through one's Akashic Record.</p> 
               <p>As an Akashic Record Consultant from the Soul Journeys School, it is my intent to share this divine wisdom of love and truth with you in Your Soul's Journey.</p>

               <h2>Baljit Rayat (Certified Teacher And Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>Before partnering with Jennifer, my life was filled with depression, anxiety and fear. I knew that something was missing from my life but I didn't know what.</p> 
               <p>There was a huge aspect of myself that needed to be expressed however; I didn't know what it was or how to express it.</p> 
               <p>Immediately after beginning to work with her my life began to shift miraculously. I had moved across the country to live in the location of my dreams, left my career in architecture and began working as a Creative Visionary Entrepreneur, Master Healer and Teacher.<br> I have truly learned how to Live in my Power as a Goddess!</p> 
               <p>Currently I am living my Soul's Purpose with freedom, joy, ease, and experiencing abundance and prosperity in all its many forms when it comes to my personal well-being, creating and sustaining loving supporting relationships and an increasing income which results from the value I offer my students and clients.</p> 
               <p>With Jennifer's empowering laser like guidance she has assisted me in recovering my Gifts and Talent that have allowed me to embrace and express my creativity and create a life worth living and sharing!</p> 
               <p>One the greatest lessons that I have learned working with Jennifer as my teacher was learning how to be in my Power, Perseverance, and Prosperity.</p> 
               <p>As soon as I learned how to manage my energy, I became more balanced in every area of my life and now live a healthy lifestyle by choosing toLove Myself First by eating better quality food, having healthy relationships with healthy boundaries and am my own boss with my desired hours of operation!</p> 
               <p>I am extremely grateful because as a healer and teacher myself, I have learned just how important it is to learn how to, and manage one's own energy and as a result I continuously see positive results and am excited for the coming months and years.</p> 
               <p>I chose to be a healer and teacher sharing my knowledge and wisdom being a stand for people who experience any of the many imbalances that keep one from accessing their creative gifts and talents; just as I have released and continue to access in my own life with the powerful assistance of Jennifer as my mentor.</p> 
               <p>It is my honor and joy to support YOU in activating YOUR gifts and talents and living in alignment to your Soul's Purpose as a Divine Goddess.</p>

               <h2>Natalie Reese (Certified Teacher And Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>Learning to access my Akashic Records has been the most profound and empowering journey into truth, love and self-acceptance. I received my first Akashic Records reading from a student of Alicia Isaacs Howes. Right away, I KNEW that learning to access my Records was something that I was meant to do. I immediately signed up to learn the Soul Journeys method with Alicia.</p> 
               <p>As I began to access my Records, I discovered that I had inadvertently been accessing them for many years. What a joy to discover that they were real that all of these things that I had felt to be true in my deepest self were in fact a form of Divine guidance!</p> 
               <p>Working in my Records has allowed me to connect to our larger spiritual existence and live this life in a more present, fully-embodied way. As an empath and intuitive, I spent a lot of my life living for and through others. The Records have helped me rebuild my relationship with myself, heal old wounds and build a life in alignment with my highest truth.</p> 
               <p>It is humbling and tremendously rewarding to support my clients in doing this work as well. There is nothing sweeter than helping others connect to their truth. As a life coach and now a Soul Journeys consultant, my motto is Love your truth. Live your purpose. To me, this is how we find our joy and achieve positive impact in the world. I am so happy to offer you the chance to discover your truth and life of passion, purpose and fulfillment.</p>

               <h2>Milada Sakic (Certified Teacher And Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>I am truly blessed beyond measure &amp; infinitely grateful because I have had a privilege and honour of meeting Jennifer Longmore in this lifetime. I have coached with Jennifer, learned from her, experienced her work first hand in many enlightening one-on-one and group sessions and remain in awe of her gift. She is an Enlightened Wisdom Keeper that holds a sacred and magical key to wholeness, a Master Soul Coach Extraordinaire whose spiritual leadership is invaluable to wellbeing of humanity today!</p> 
               <p>Before studying and coaching with Jennifer and experiencing the Akashic Records healing, I have spent years of studying astrology &amp; Eastern Mysticism and continued to search for a holistic way of accurately &amp; consistently accessing my inner guidance. Then, meeting Jennifer felt like a magical breakthrough. Jennifer interprets energy &amp; the Akashic Records with laser-like accuracy and with her solution-focused approach she quickly zooms in on the core issue within seconds of speaking with you and immediately identifies most valuable information that will empower you to be able to make practical decisions today.</p> 
               <p>Immediately after my first session with Jennifer and remembering my soul's purpose, more joy, expansion, clarity and purpose flooded my life in the most loving and harmonious way. One of the greatest shifts I had with Jennifer as my teacher was realigning to Who I Truly Am from a place of highest integrity and highest good, which deeply resonated with me. It is that feeling of exhilaration, expansiveness &amp; joy that confirms you are on the right path while BEing more of who you are without a shadow of a doubt. Coaching with Jennifer has been invaluable to me because it not only brought powerful healing into my life, but with a sense of urgency I soon realized that more people needed to learn about her work and The Soul Journeys Method, so I was deeply inspired to become a soul coach, teacher and healer myself so that I could help more people realign with their purpose.</p>

               <h2>Manpreet Dhillon (Certified Teacher And Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>I have been meditating using a library system since 2005 and was introduced to the Akashic Records during a trip to an ayurvedic resort in Kerala. A friend mentioned it and I was drawn to it instantly. I started researching what it was, where to get readings and teachers so I can learn about it as well. I was introduced to Baljit through another friend, who started working with me in my records. Soon I started the training and started to access my records through the Soul Journeys method. Since my journey with the akashic records, I found my journey to be shift many things in my life from my beliefs about values, worthiness, self love and how I showed up in the world. I went from being a wall that was tough to connect with to being in my goddess self. I loved how akashic records get to the core root of an issue, deal with it and allow us to anchor in new belief systems. This is how easy life is meant to be.</p> 
               <p>Currently I am living my life with passion and drive. I know I have a divine purpose and I am ready to fulfill it. My passion lies in supporting others in stepping into their essence in order to live their life in empowerment. It is my honor and pleasure to be of service to those who are on their own journeys.</p>

               <h2>Janne Edney (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>I met Jennifer Longmore at a pivotal point in my life: I felt a huge disconnect between life and work as I was experiencing it wildly discontented but lost as to what my true life work might actually be. I'd recently left the corporate world and was considering my next steps.</p> 
               <p>As Jennifer accessed the Akashic Records on my behalf, I was able to find clarity and set a new direction in life that was aligned to who I am at soul level, and brought me the joy and lightness I was looking for. And bonus! Over the course of our work together, my PTS and trauma surrounding a serious motor vehicle accident was healed in quantum leaps.</p> 
               <p>From these experiences I quickly realized the Akashic Records were a key not only to discovering my soul purpose but to aligning with that purpose, to living life on purpose and to creating my desired life: consciously, powerfully, soulfully.</p> 
               <p>Working in my own records was just the beginning, as a health and wellness transformation coach, I wanted to bring these same mindset shifts and quantum leaps to my clients to serve them more holistically: body, mind and soul.</p> 
               <p>Fast forward to today: as a Certified Akashic Records Consultant in the Soul Journeys Method, I share my passion for transformative living with others who want to create clarity, flow and heart-led, purposeful lives. I access the Akashic Records to help people quickly and effectively move beyond the stories, patterns and non-realities in their lives, identify and clear blocks and restrictions, and consciously co-create healthy, joyful, fulfilling lives.</p>

               <h2>Andra Evans (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>I began being curious about my Akashic Records during a significant life change, at which time I began receiving visions during my meditation practice. I was at a challenging phase of life with regard to my career, relationships, and health, and it wasn't until I connected with my Akashic Records that I found clarity around the changes that were occurring - I knew I was being called to a more authentic life path that would open space for more love, peace, and purpose.</p> 
               <p>As a spiritual therapist and coach, the day finally came when I knew part of my path would be to help others find clarity and healing through their Akashic Records, so when I saw Jennifer was teaching the Soul Journeys Method I was thrilled to sign up and dive deeper into the records! Since working with Jennifer and the Soul Journeys Method, I have dissolved away layer upon layer of beliefs that kept me from feeling empowered. I learned the truth about my core gifts and ability to create a life built around the essence of who I am - a life of aligned work and service, loving partnerships, creative expression, and radiant health.</p> 
               <p>Since working in my records, I have become a published author, and built a thriving personal empowerment coaching practice. I love helping people get to the truth of who they are, and connect to their gifts, so it is my honour to hold a space for YOU to find more purpose, meaning, and inspiration in YOUR life!!</p>

               <h2>John Iadipaolo (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>Since 2009, I have been engaged in a healing journey to reclaim my vitality, my empowerment and my true Self. Persistent pain from unhealed injuries, limiting belief systems and old emotional trauma impaired the right to enjoy living and thriving in my body. I sensed a deep longing to grow and engage as a positive force in the world, but lacked perspective and guidance on how to do so.</p> 
               <p>After years of healing and training in a variety of physical, mental and emotional modalities of self-awareness and well-being, I was drawn to explore the Akashic Records. I coached and trained in Levels 1-3 with Milada Sakic in my hometown of Toronto, Canada and was amazed at the potential for immediate, tangible healing and empowerment made available through the Soul Journeys method. The clarity, confidence and gratitude I have gained through this work inspired me coach privately and train directly with Jennifer in Level 4, where my growth has accelerated exponentially.</p> 
               <p>Over 16 years of working as a teacher and mentor with individuals around the world has shown me that no two people are alike. We can each access our own source of personal truth and empowerment through exploring our inner symbolism and relationships with the outside world. I feel inspired and alive to work with highly creative individuals who are motivated to grow and realize their full potential.</p>

               <h2>Carolyn Jackson (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>I am an empowerment coach. It is my soul purpose to expand joy in peoples lives.</p> 
               <p>It is my mission to promote self-acceptance and self-love to enable lifestyle transformation so that everyone around me may live inspired, fulfilling and joyful lives.</p> 
               <p>A little of my history-</p> 
               <p>In 2007 I became socially isolated. Friends would call and I would agree to go out then I would back out at the last moment for whatever excuse. All of my thoughts stemmed from hatred towards myself and I was careless with my body and my life. I did hard drugs and had thoughts of suicide though I would never have actually done it. Deep down I knew there was a reason for me being here. Finally, I got sick of hearing myself complain about the same things over and over. I decided I had to pick myself up. After extensive emotional healing and transformation, it is now my passion to empower women. Not that men don't need empowerment as well, I identify with womens issues more easily. I love to empower women of all sizes, of all backgrounds and of all heart knock stories. I can closely identify with overweight and obese women as I have been obese for 17 years. I have learned how to accept myself and love myself for who I am! I now show up in this world with loving, respectful thoughts of myself. It is my passion to facilitate self-acceptance and self-love to all of my sisters and it is so important in this time of the emergence of the Divine Feminine.</p>

               <h2>Christine Johel (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>Before meeting Jennifer or hearing of her, my old belief system of myself was all an illusion. I was a shy, fearful person with very low self-esteem. I was a person who would avoid being noticed or to draw any attention to myself in social or family gatherings. Being the centre of attention was a foreign concept to me. Ever since Jennifer and Baljit introduced me to Akashic Record readings, I am able to be centre of attention, be noticed, speak my truth, be in my Divine Light and be part of life. My old escape from reality was to daydream of another life or to read them in romantic novels. Now I am living life and experiencing new things.</p> 
               <p>In my journey, I was led to my life's purpose of guiding, supporting and healing others in their life's purpose. As an Akashic Record Consultant from the Soul Journeys School, it is my intent to support you through your journey.</p>

               <p>After meeting with Jennifer for my first Akashic record consultas a result of the shifts and alignments that occurred on that very first day - so much clarity came for my life's purpose.</p> 
               <p>So many synchronicities started to occur in my life, allowing me to let go of my limited beliefs filled with doub. I found courage and being beautifully divinely guided shifted to what I really wanted to do with my life. Working in my Record, my life started to shift for the better in all of my relationships and amazing things happened all around me. I was being shown how to live in my full potential!! After experiencing this expansion in my life, and being gently nudged by Jennifer I was empowered to complete level 4 to be an empowered Akashic Records Consultant, and now furthering that goal - now Teaching Akashic Records !! I am truly amazed by the transformation the Akashic Records have offered my life. I'm sharing three words to describe working in your Akashic Records - Success, Accomplishment, and Renewal of Life- our souls purpose!</p>

               <h2>Chiara Larizza (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>I have spent many years working in my Akashic Records with Jennifer and have studied under her to become a certified Akashic Record Consultant using the Soul Journeys Method. Jennifer has been AWEspiring to me and has encouraged and guided me to follow my own Spiritual path and achieve my quest with guided consultations to this day. She is powerful, loving &amp; full of enormous wisdom.</p> 
               <p>As a young child I always knew that I had something that was unique to me that made me different from others. I did not disclose this information to too many others until I was in my twenties. I began doing readings for people working with the Angelic realm, after visiting Jennifer she let me know that I was already working in the Akashic Records only I was not calling it that! I knew how incredible &amp; miraculous working in my records with Jennifer was &amp; as a result, I decided to fine tune my skills &amp; make this my full time career to help others to really step into their truth &amp; life path easily &amp; effortlessly. It is a never ending journey filled with so much enlightenment &amp; empowerment for all!</p> 
               <p>Before consulting with Jennifer and experiencing the Akashic Records, my entire life felt as though it was in upheaval filled with insecurity, lack of, and I was living to make others happy, not myself. I was clearly living an illusion. Now I have learned a healthy balance. One big lesson has been that if I am not happy first, I cannot help contribute to somebody elses happiness or well being. Today, I know how to step into a feeling of happiness in an instant thanks to Jennifer! She is like a diamond, sparkling with clarity, joy &amp; light! I truly love her and am greatly appreciative for having been referred to her on my soul's journey.</p> 
               <p>There have been so many shifts working with Jennifer as my consultant, coach and teacher. Jennifer is all about truth, whether you like it or not! This has been invaluable to me in order to really follow my path as a Lightworker. I now am able to be in integrity with myself, hence, for others as well. She is very serious about the work and has simply guided me to achieve results and make changes that were necessary to achieve permanent transformation.</p>

               <h2>Alexis Logan (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>I heard about Jennifer Longmore and the Akashic Records through a friend. She spoke so beautifully about her experience with Jennifer and the transformations she received, I knew I had to schedule a session. My session with Jennifer was so profound, the course of my life changed in the following months.</p> 
               <p>First, my sister encouraged me to attend training with Jennifer to read the Akashic Records in Sedona. I thought I was going, just to tag along, but I received the deepest healings during those three magical days. I was able to identify how I was holding myself back from living my dreams and make the space for divine energies to support my goals. I aligned with my soul's purpose, allowing me to leave my full-time job six weeks after the training.</p> 
               <p>Before the Akashic Records, I was hiding from the real me. I was closed off from others, I was depressed, and I was stuck in a job I hated. I felt guilty for wanting more from life and I did not feel I deserved to create more for myself. Through the Akashic Records, I learned how to step up and be of high service, to be seen for who I am, love the woman I see in the mirror, and create the business I have always wanted.</p> 
               <p>I look at my life in awe of what is possible through working with the Akashic Records. I am really in a powerful place and I am loving it. I'm so happy to offer the same opportunities for healing to others.</p>

               <h2>Saskia Roell (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>We all have a unique Soul's path and at some point in your life you're called to open that door. I've always listened to the calling of my Soul. Ten years ago I was guided to leave Holland on the spur of the moment and move to America with my husband and our five young kids. They didn't speak a word of English. We had little money, no jobs or contacts waiting. We're still here because I believe in Big dreams and taking action to make them happen. The moment I read about the Akashic Records certification I knew that this would be my next step into my Soul's journey. I opened that l door too and loved it from the first minute I heard Jennifer talking; it felt like a home coming. Jennifer is a master and I am so glad I received these teaching from her.</p> 
               <p>For the last 18 years I've coached people to identify their Soul Purpose and take the leap to go from stuck to unstoppable in going after their dreams. What makes my work extra joyful is that right now the Akashic Record Keepers are my biggest helpers. Their wisdom initiates miracles. Time after time I'm blown away by their divine guidance. Thank you Jennifer for your incredible powerful and loving mentoring.</p>

               <h2>Kim Sarrasin (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>After supporting thousands of women in their love life for many years (and proudly achieving a 97% success rate for connecting women with their soulmate). I knew I wanted to offer an even deeper level of healing for my clients. This is when I decided to attend one of Jennifer's retreats in Sedona to receive training with the Akashic Records. When I decide to go for something I tend to go full throttle, so getting trained in all 3 levels of the Records within 3 days aligned perfectly with my fiery personality and enthusiasm! And, as always, Jennifer over delivered. Her ability to hold space for a large group of people doing deep, transformational work allowed me to have the biggest personal awakening, insights and shifts that helped me release many old limiting patterns I was aware of and many hidden blocks I was blind to.</p> 
               <p>I am clear my willingness to go that deep for myself created a beautiful opening and safety for my clients to do the same for themselves. I love that I can now access Ancient Wisdom, Truth and the real Soul of my clients. As a result, my clients are able to achieve their goals at a much more accelerated pace. I am overjoyed to include Akashic Record readings to my list of services to support all the lovely ladies I serve around the world not only in their love life, but with money and their business as well. Thank you Jennifer &amp; Record Keepers!</p>

               <p>When her guides introduced Jennifer Longmore via email, Barbara Schultz's life reflected beliefs that did not serve her well. Although attempting to create a healing respite on her small farm, Barbara felt blocked physically, financially and emotionally. Serendipitously, she enrolled in the Akashic Record certification course. With Jennifer's guidance, knowledge and infinite healing abilities, completing the study of Akashic Records literally saved Barbara's life.

               <h2>Alison Stokes (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>Like so many others, I have always been searching for faster and more effective ways to access instant Healing Energy for the physical body, as well as the mental &amp; emotional levels. With the Soul Journeys Method I feel I can now end my search, as this method of consulting the Sacred Akashic Records, has given me the freedom, information and control that I was lacking.</p> 
               <p>My path to this point was filled with fear, anxiety, struggle and depression, which stemmed from a belief I had long held, that I didn't belong here on this Planet, and I was doomed to remain here isolated, broke and alone. Over the past 25 years, I had qualified in many Healing Techniques, both here in Ireland and abroad, from Hawaiian Reiki (Earth energy) to Tibetan Dae Jeng Kong (Sound energy,) desperately hoping to find a cure for my Depression and various physical ailments that Western Doctors could not treat. Finally, I followed my intuitive prompts to treat myself to an Akashic Records Reading with Alicia Isaacs Howes, who had qualified as a Master Teacher &amp; Consultant with Jennifer Longmore. Things began to slowly turn around, and I became so fascinated and curious about the contents of my Akashic Records, that I finally decided to become a Certified Consultant myself, and plunged right in to the Training Courses.</p> 
               <p>I have experienced a Spiritual connection to the Universe, far more expansive and accelerated, than I could ever had imagined, which gave meaning to my very existence, and illuminated my purpose here on many levels. My explorations with my own Akashic Record Keepers, have sharpened my intuitive awareness and insight, giving me a higher level of clarity and vision in my Readings with Clients. The Soul Journeys Method has tied in so well with my previous qualifications as an Astrologer and Counsellor, and enabled me to assist others in finding and removing the origin of their pain and confusion, and empowering them to take control of their Health, Finances and Relationships, and turn things around for themselves, as I did.</p> 
               <p>The honour and privilege of working in these Sacred Akashic Records continues to both humble and amaze me, and I'm excited at the prospect of delving into the Akashic Records for others who continue to struggle and feel blocked on their life's path. I'm overjoyed to be able to work in the Akashic Records as a Consultant for others, as I can now assist them in finding out the reasons <strong>why they keep repeating the same patterns or partners and shift those to attract the experiences, opportunities and relationships they'd love!</strong></p> 
               <p>So if you're ready to <strong>clear</strong> the hidden patterns in your life, your relationships, your health and money issues, then I'd love to dive right in and aide you to explore your unique path on this Planet, and support you on your voyage.

               <p>When I first heard of the akashic records I knew nothing about it! I have studied many different paths to create change for myself and with my clients but there was something that stuck out for me and kept calling me back to learn more. I found my way to Jennifer and have been on an amazing path learning to trust myself, and to access the information I was seeking from others from myself instead - from my records.</p> 
               <p>This changes everything! I jumped right in to all three levels, and am now studying the teacher training. I'm so excited to do this work for myself and for my clients, to see the amazing shifts that take place is so much more powerful than anything I have experienced. Now I am able to weave my intuitive business consulting, sales strategy and mastery transformational coaching for women entrepreneurs together and create even more profound results, aligning myself and my clients to our own unique truth.</p> 
               <p>I'm excited to support my clients to stand in their power with their intuition so they can live, lead, and speak their soul truth and fulfill their big mission in their business (and their life).</p>

               <h2>Melanie Sylla (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>The first time I entered my Akashic Records, I experienced an intense feeling of reconnection and belonging. I was exactly where I was meant to be. After practicing for some time on my own, I asked my Guides to lead me to the perfect mentor who would support me in going deeper and live my life more fully. The very next day, someone I highly respect introduced me to Jennifer's work. I started to study the Soul Journeys Akashic Record Certification Program and was blessed to also work with Jennifer personally. Her effective, straight-to-the-point approach, and the unique level of Light she embodies makes her a truly inspiring model and mentor on my spiritual journey. In a short amount of time, I experienced tremendous growth and joy. I reconnected with my Soul's purpose, my abilities to manifest and this empowering feeling of having something important to share with the World.</p> 
               <p>For as long as I can remember, I have always felt that we are more than just a physical body on the earth. I was attuned to Reiki when I was 10, and started to research spirituality and natural health in my teenage years. I quickly fell in love with Essential Oils, and was blessed to be trained in Holistic Aromatherapy, studying and experimenting extensively with the classical and energy use of oils, and developing a subtle connection with the Plant Realm. I have been researching and experimenting with natural health, nutrition and energy work since then, but it was only after my son was born that I decided to turn this passion into a practice. So I formally trained in naturopathy and nutrition, and finally answered my calling.</p> 
               <p>Yet, even though I could feel I was on the right path, I was still feeling stuck in many areas of my life, and that I was missing out on something vital. I could feel this deep Love and Light growing in my heart, but I didn't know how to express it or share it with the World.</p> 
               <p>Working in my Akashic Records, on my own and with Jennifer, has allowed me to release so many blocks, and to finally take aligned actions and manifest a life I love, sharing my gifts with the World. So many doors have opened since I reconnected with the Truth and Light of the Akashic Records, and I want you to be able to experience this divine potential and freedom too.</p> 
               <p>As a Healer and Teacher, I work with other Lightworkers to help them transform their life and manifest thriving health by uncovering the roots of their health challenges at all levels, raising their vibration and shining their Light brighter.</p>

               <h2>Meredith MacKenzie (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>For as long as I can remember I've felt like I was searching for something. Even as a young child, the religious teachings recited to me just didn't resonate with my heart. I wanted answers that no one could provide. "Why?" was a constant word out of my mouth, much to the consternation of my family and teachers!</p> 
               <p>What I didn't realize back then was what I was really searching for was my connection to Source. The connection back to my true self, behind all the curtains of what society told me was "true." I always knew in my heart that there was so much more that is unexplained to us, and I wanted in!</p> 
               <p>My intuition has always been very strong (although learning to listen to it was an entirely different story!) and so as I gradually started to learn about all that is, none of it came as a surprise to me. It felt like coming home. Of course, constantly asking "why?" triggered a great many situations to arise in my life that forced me to ask that very question.</p> 
               <p>Being raised in a Christian house I was told what to believe and how to do it, right from day one. I refused. I used to run away and hide before church, even as a small girl; so my family would be forced to leave without me. Of course the other children were none too impressed and I grew up very alone. Once highschool arrived I knew it was 'fit in - or get out' time, and I did my best. I became someone else entirely, bending to every whim and opinion of whoever crossed my path that day. The longer I persisted, the quieter my intuition became.</p> 
               <p>After leaving high-school I engaged in a number of less-than-ideal relationships, ending up homeless, jobless and broke. I became more miserable and cynical and blamed the world and everyone in it, everyone but myself. I was fully entrenched in the 'victim mentality.'</p> 
               <p>Then I finally met someone who could answer nearly every one of my "why's." We spent months going over every tiny question I could think of, until I exhausted all my questions. Surprisingly to me, I still felt unfulfilled. So I set off in search of more! I travelled the US for a year, China, worked in many different jobs, lived in a horse stall for 2 years, dated more less-than-ideal men and continued to feel like I needed more challenge. So, I joined the army.</p> 
               <p>By 24 I was a fully trained Armoured Soldier with multiple awards for marksmanship, weapons handling and communications. I was one of only 5 females in my squadron. As you can imagine, military life takes its toll and I retired in 2012 more bitter, angry, drunk and violent than I had ever known possible. I would have anxiety attacks just standing alone in my kitchen.</p> 
               <p>I knew I needed to do something, and fast. I remembered a long lost passion for Massage Therapy and enrolled in school that fall. By the end of the year I had achieved the highest marks ever recorded in the history of the college and I stepped into the world as a healer, instead of a soldier. Still I wanted more.</p> 
               <p>So the following year I enrolled in Equine Osteopathy but left after the first year once I realized...it still didn't answer my WHY. That's when I decided to take the Akashic Records Course for myself. Since then my entire existence has done a complete 180 turn. After truly learning WHY my soul chose all these life lessons, seeing the patterns I was keeping myself trapped in, and facing many things I thought long-buried, I found my SELF.</p> 
               <p>And now I get to share with you my WHY, for all my experiences have brought me here to allow me to extend that hand for others looking for a way out of their trenches, and into their own true self.</p>

               <h2>Isobel Dore (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>I was led to Jennifer &amp; the concept of the Akashic Record and felt I had instantly stumbled upon something incredible. I was listening to her classes with my hair standing up on end and the deepest feeling of wonder and amazement. This was the deepest feeling of YES I had ever felt. And it felt as if I had been waiting my whole life to hear.</p> 
               <p>The wisdom and knowledge Jennifer offered was music to my soul and it felt as if I had been waiting my whole life to hear the beautiful love and truth contained within the record.</p> 
               <p>I completed the practitioner course and started to work with Jennifer as a mentor and coach in a really pivotal point in my life. The changes this work bought about in me have been nothing short of mind-blowing. From feelings of being lost and stuck, struggling with ill health, self doubt, and lacking purpose and meaning, I have completely turned into a healthy, vibrant and spiritual woman standing in her own power, enthusiastic, and aligned with my own Souls Purpose. Such is the power of the Akashic Record.</p> 
               <p>I now ask if the Record is calling to you too and invite you work with me to sake off your old beliefs, programs and uncertainty and replace it with the deepest feelings of belonging and hope imaginable.</p>

               <h2>Julie Archambault (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>Living the busy life of a school teacher for a decade left me with many professional skills and accomplishments. And yet, during this time, once the bustle would quiet at the end of the day, my personal and intimate life felt devastatingly empty. Why didn't I have time or energy for myself? Why did I constantly feel fatigued? Why was I so lonely?</p> 
               <p>Over the years, I tried many routes to achieve balance in my life, but my whirlwind life never fully stopped. This lifestyle always resulted in feeling depleted and disconnected from myself. Reversing this trend felt like swimming against a stubborn current. I needed help out of this vortex to fully own that I was in fact the creator of my life. I was the river, the current and the swimmer all in one.</p> 
               <p>This is when my work in the Akashic Records started unravelling my unconscious belief systems. I embarked on this revealing detective work, where I had to sort through family dynamics, as well as cultural and ancestral beliefs. To manifest my life differently I had to find the root cause of my depleting behaviour, which I could not see at the time. I eventually came to understand why I was feeling empty. The Akashic Records opened my consciousness to painful dynamics, such as abandonment, self-power, and withdrawal, that were fundamental to my life since childhood. These dynamics, or stories I believed to be true, were holding me back from my full creative potential.</p> 
               <p>For the first time in my life, I achieved a sense of clarity. I immediately could release stagnating energies and open to new possibilities in myself. This process guided me to write Snakeskinned Stories - a blog (note: hyperlink the word blog.tosnakeskinned.com) and forthcoming book of collected stories about healing journeys and sexual epiphanies.</p> 
               <p>Seeing such transformative results in myself convinced me to become a certified Akashic Records practitioner. My practice assists clients through their own process, clearing blockages in areas such as work, love, relationships, sex, money, self-power and boundaries. I'm committed to help clients achieve a heightened sense of wellbeing and creative freedom in their lives. I'm pleased to be of service to you!</p>

               <h2>Ca Saundra Phillips (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>Thinking about my life story and how I got here is one of the hardest things I have ever done and at the same time the most freeing. My family has always been supportive, my parents knew from a young age that I was indeed different. Every adventure that I have been though in my life was not always rainbows and sunshine, but it has made me the person I am today and I would never take it away.</p> 
               <p>My life was always guiding me to become an Akashic Record Consultant. It is humorous and strange to have hindsight 20/20. To be able to see how my life was pushing me to become what I truly am meant to be. The events that lead me here are unbelievable. When I first met the beautiful and wonderful Baljit, my life at the time seemed like it could not get any worse nor better. After one Akashic Record session I was liberated from many old belief systems and was able to see a light at the end of the tunnel.</p> 
               <p>Once that session was complete I couldn't believe that I was going to invest money into myself to receive more sessions. Thanks to knowing how to listen to my higher self I took the leap of faith and that will forever be one of my proudest moments. I knew from there that I was ready to become an Akashic Record consultant.</p> 
               <p>Since then my life has ascended to new heights. I have not looked back and I couldn't even if I wanted to because I LOVE my truth and all I want to do is to share it with the universe. With my world evolving around me as I keep stepping towards better things, I can see how I can help others globally. I am more than thrilled to be joining so many empowering souls.</p> 
               <p>I am excited for this eye opening journey and look forward to supporting so many beautiful people waiting to realize their fullest potential."</p>

               <h2>Brandi Thiessen (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>For nearly my entire life, I felt like I didn't belong to this world. Not only that I didn't belong, but that I didn't overly want to be here anymore either. I had spent a lot of time trying to convince others of my value, by over extending myself, working ridiculous hours and waving goodbye to possible social or romantic relationships in the process. I also became very good at hiding, staying enough on the radar to make my business run, but not enough to take it to the level I felt inside me that it could be. The belief that this was all pointless, and that I was powerless to whatever may come my way, only ensured that my world became more and more closed off.</p> 
               <p>As I let my world become closed off, my anxiety, depression, frustration and anger only fuel more feelings of their kind. I had arrived at a point in my life where I was no longer enjoying my passion of working with horses, and struggled to simply keep up with the 'flow of life', as I drowned in thoughts of what felt like reliefless misery. As I lived in my wounding, any romantic relationships I pursued felt empty and pointless. The same results relived over in seeming repetition left me me hurt, or worse, numb feeling.</p> 
               <p>After seeing the changes taking place in a friends life (and perspectives of it!) who had enrolled in Soul Journeys Akashic Records with Baljit Rayat (Lotus Destiny), I decided this was something I absolutely had to do for myself.</p> 
               <p>I stepped into Level 1 Soul Journeys with a genuine eagerness and excitement. This entire process was filled with a full feeling of 'coming home'. With the sacred information received in my Akashic records, it set me on the journey of allowing myself to become who I was meant to be. Going forward, my entire reality shifted. As the layers of non serving beliefs were lifted, my relationship with my higher self began the most powerful transformation. The closer I became with self, the more compassion, love, joy, excitement, ease and relief I experienced within my life. Hidden deep and 'dark' beliefs and trauma's were let go of, and I felt like my eyes were just open for the first time.</p> 
               <p>With the help of my teacher Baljit, my passion had reignited itself in such a irresistible way. I began practicing animal communication much more, revamped my entire business, and most importantly, I found the 'real me', who turned out to be someone more powerful and loving than I had ever imagined possible before. I began to understand why I am here, and that all of my work in the records, with horses and animal communication are simply all examples of healing modalities.</p> 
               <p>I am here to assist both humans and animals in their journeys together.</p> 
               <p>It is my privilege to offer a helping hand for you too, should you also be seeking to find the 'real you'.</p>

               <h2>Jill Mackay (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>A wife. a daughter. a sister. an auntie. a friend.</p> 
               <p>As a little girl, I had many outer body experiences and interactions with spirit. I realized that my own experiences weren't everyone's experiences based on their reactions. Spiritually levitating from my bed or seeing energy bubbles from trees was not a normal thing to discuss. As I reached teen aged years, I continued to experience the world behind the veil however I kept it private - to fit in. Overtime I repressed my intuitive gifts, focused on athletics, entered academics, and eventually the workforce. Fast forward 20 years and a career in Information Technology- the universe gave me several wake-up calls to tell me that I wasn't on the right path. Gratefully, I finally listened and the last 3 years have been a blessing.</p> 
               <p>In September 2016 during my daily Kundalini meditation, I was called. My guides told me I was ready to start my transformational journey. I was led to Baljit Rayat and I took my first step to certification. After many sessions, tears, and laughter, finally healing. My philosophy: when you heal yourself, you can heal the world. I am now on a path that makes my soul sing. I feel deeply connected to rocks and trees; I get electrified by the moon, the stars, and the aurora; I'm in awe of the power of mantra and love the feeling as sound vibrations stir every cell of my being.</p> 
               <p>Working in the Akashic Records has allowed me to connect to a larger spiritual existence, embrace mother earth, and to love this gift called life. I've never felt so complete. The Akashic Records reveals what is hidden, what is holding us back. It has empowered me to live in my truth and to share my gifts through love, grace and ease. Work with me and find your TRUTH, your WAY, and your LIGHT.</p>

               <h2>Jennifer Field (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>Discovering the Akashic Records, and the Soul Journeys format of reading and working within these realms, was like someone turning on a light switch for me. Suddenly I had a much clearer context of what I had been feeling my way around the dark in discovering a language for it, and understanding of how to properly navigate what was suddenly, a whole new world.</p> 
               <p>With the help of this work, I have overcome early childhood trauma, and extreme challenges in my personal and professional life; especially when I lost my home and business in a fire, and my 3 closest relatives all faced major health scares.</p> 
               <p>Being on the receiving end of this brilliant work, and then becoming a certified consultant, I have been able to reclaim lost power, rebuild myself, our home and business, restore my own health and right relationships, heal past misperceptions, and overcome limitations.</p> 
               <p>The Akashic Records have helped me anchor a deeper compassion and understanding of myself, others, and the interconnectedness of all things. I am absolutely honored to continue on this incredible path, and be able to support others on their own unique Soul Journey.</p>

               <h2>Selin Alpogan (Certified Consultant)</h2> 
               <p>I was a graduate, fresh out of college, and I didnt know what I wanted to be. Fast forward 20 years. I had 5 very different careers under my belt. But I was at the same place: I still didnt have any clarity as to what I wanted to be.</p> 
               <p>Then one day, the Akashic Records found me. I collapsed on my bed, crying uncontrollably.</p> 
               <p>My husband came over, worried, are you ok? he asked.</p> 
               <p>Yes I said through my tears, Im ok..., then thought to myself ...for the first time in my life.</p> 
               <p>That was the moment when I finally felt settled. I felt relieved. The clarity and the knowing that I had found was beyond what I can put into words.</p> 
               <p>Since then, Ive helped numerous entrepreneurs shed the weight of that which no longer serves them in their business and/or their personal life through their Akashic Records.</p> 
               <p>In my experience and my clients, after letting go, clarity emerges. Clarity, in turn, leads to true alignment. And true alignment steers us to a state of prosperity.</p> 
               <p>When we have a breakthrough, my clients often tell me that they <em>feel light</em>.</p>
