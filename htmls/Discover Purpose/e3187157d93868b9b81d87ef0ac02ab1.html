I shall remember this experience forever.&quot; &quot;It has been a transformative 8 weeks and I’m very grateful for having stumbled across this journey of awakenings.&quot; &quot;I feel very blessed and grateful to have stumbled across this gem of course.&quot; &quot;This is the best Sydney Community College course that I’ve done. This is a great opportunity to create a toolkit for better living. Thank you!&quot; &quot;I learned some valuable tools to put my thoughts and ideas to my mind map. The tutor has been a wonderful coach guiding us through and I found a new meaning investment which is to mind map every week!&quot; &quot;Brilliant course – the discipline of coming each week was very helpful and made much easier by the skill of our teacher, the enthusiasm of the group and the energy of addressing the issues in good company.&quot; &quot;The tutor is a gifted generous and natural educator. The course content was not only original but generated an enthusiasm and commitment to process for all of our group. We didn’t want it to end.&quot; &quot;This course has brought me back to life! Being true to myself, be authentic and just do it. I have benefitted from hearing people’s experiences, seen things in different perspectives and learnt a lot. I have enjoyed every minute of class.&quot; &quot;The tutor is really an amazing facilitator and highlights what is meaningful in a very positive and creative way. The Life Purpose course was truly life-changing.&quot; &quot;I have always been skeptical about ‘self-help’ type courses, but I have been able to take so much out of this course that I’m really going to miss these meetings.&quot; &quot;I just feel so grateful to have found this course and to have been able to spend the last few weeks with you and such a wonderful group of people. I have found your teaching inspirational and have so looked forward to my Wednesday nights as the highlight of my week. I shall be very sad to see it end but so glad to have taken part.&quot; &quot;I can hand on heart say I’ve never started and finished a course without missing a class- until now.&quot; &quot;This course has been a whole-hearted guide toward creating an authentic purposeful life. We’ve also been blessed to have a fabulous group of complete strangers who through sharing in this life-changing work, have become friends. Thank-you, a real gift.&quot; &quot;It didn’t go for long enough none of us wanted it to end ! I’ve done lots with the college and have never seen the enthusiasm and commitment til the end with a group no small measure down to neddies informative and inclusive style great course&quot; &quot;It was singularly the best course I have EVER enrolled in and the only course of this kind over a number of weeks that I haven’t missed a single class....The tutor was a standout tutor – warm, engaging, knowledgeable, and authoritative. They made you want to be there every week.&quot; &quot;In addition to sharing with us from their wealth of knowledge and understanding of what we needed from this course, The tutor guided us through the content with a lot of kindness, compassion and insight, which I believe is what has made this course so beneficial and worthwhile. I also think that the longerterm benefits will be even more evident as time goes by.&quot; &quot;I had a wonderful time doing this course. Our tutor was fantastic and the group of people I did it with were so friendly and willing to share openly of their own experiences. The content of the course was excellent and I wished that we could have had moresessions to explore it in more depth.&quot; &quot;The tutor is a fantastic facilitator and balanced the class well with information, group work, direction and encouragement. Very good at getting everyone to share and probing for more information in a group setting. They distilled the information from the book to manageable chunks for each class.&quot; &quot;It was the perfect course for me at this time and great to be with others who were in the same situation looking for more out of life. As mentioned before the tutor was a really great facilitator and gave good ground rules like ‘just show up’ whether we’d done thehomework or not....no judgement all. I also liked that they had a guest speaker mid way and this gave everyone encouragement too. It was a really great group of people as well in the course both open and supportive.&quot; &quot;The tutor was very knowledgeable and kept the class very interested.&quot; &quot;I found George to be highly engaging when delivering this class. He was a wonderful teacher who made each and every lesson both interesting funny and thought provoking. &quot;I found this course so relatable and interesting and each week I feel like I really took a lot out of it and couldn’t wait for the following week to continue with the next lesson. I felt like the lessons related totally to what was happening in my life and I gained many useful tools/ thoughts to help in my day to day. I wish this course was longer. I didn’t want it to end.&quot; &quot;Great teacher. Very clear and structured course, tackling a difficult topic.&quot; Avoid disappointment. Enrol early.

I shall remember this experience forever."</i></p><p><i>"It has been a transformative 8 weeks and I’m very grateful for having stumbled across this journey of awakenings."</i></p><p><i>"I feel very blessed and grateful to have stumbled across this gem of course."</i></p><p><i>"This is the best Sydney Community College course that I’ve done. This is a great opportunity to create a toolkit for better living. Thank you!"</i></p><p><i>"I learned some valuable tools to put my thoughts and ideas to my mind map. The tutor has been a wonderful coach guiding us through and I found a new meaning investment which is to mind map every week!"</i></p><p><i>"Brilliant course – the discipline of coming each week was very helpful and made much easier by the skill of our teacher, the enthusiasm of the group and the energy of addressing the issues in good company."</i></p><p><i>"The tutor is a gifted generous and natural educator. The course content was not only original but generated an enthusiasm and commitment to process for all of our group. We didn’t want it to end."</i></p><p><i>"This course has brought me back to life! Being true to myself, be authentic and just do it. I have benefitted from hearing people’s experiences, seen things in different perspectives and learnt a lot. I have enjoyed every minute of class."</i></p><p><i>"The tutor is really an amazing facilitator and highlights what is meaningful in a very positive and creative way. The Life Purpose course was truly life-changing."</i></p><p><i>"I have always been skeptical about ‘self-help’ type courses, but I have been able to take so much out of this course that I’m really going to miss these meetings."</i></p><p><i>"I just feel so grateful to have found this course and to have been able to spend the last few weeks with you and such a wonderful group of people. I have found your teaching inspirational and have so looked forward to my Wednesday nights as the highlight of my week. I shall be very sad to see it end but so glad to have taken part."</i></p><p><i>"I can hand on heart say I’ve never started and finished a course without missing a class- until now."</i></p><p><i>"This course has been a whole-hearted guide toward creating an authentic purposeful life. We’ve also been blessed to have a fabulous group of complete strangers who through sharing in this life-changing work, have become friends. Thank-you, a real gift."</i></p><p><i>"It didn’t go for long enough none of us wanted it to end ! I’ve done lots with the college and have never seen the enthusiasm and commitment til the end with a group no small measure down to neddies informative and inclusive style great course"</i></p><p><i>"It was singularly the best course I have EVER enrolled in and the only course of this kind over a number of weeks that I haven’t missed a single class....The tutor was a standout tutor – warm, engaging, knowledgeable, and authoritative. They made you want to be there every week."</i></p><p><i>"In addition to sharing with us from their wealth of knowledge and understanding of what we needed from this course, The tutor guided us through the content with a lot of kindness, compassion and insight, which I believe is what has made this course so beneficial and worthwhile. I also think that the longerterm benefits will be even more evident as time goes by."</i></p><p><i>"I had a wonderful time doing this course. Our tutor was fantastic and the group of people I did it with were so friendly and willing to share openly of their own experiences. The content of the course was excellent and I wished that we could have had moresessions to explore it in more depth."</i></p><p><i>"The tutor is a fantastic facilitator and balanced the class well with information, group work, direction and encouragement. Very good at getting everyone to share and probing for more information in a group setting. They distilled the information from the book to manageable chunks for each class."</i></p><p><i>"It was the perfect course for me at this time and great to be with others who were in the same situation looking for more out of life. As mentioned before the tutor was a really great facilitator and gave good ground rules like ‘just show up’ whether we’d done thehomework or not....no judgement all. I also liked that they had a guest speaker mid way and this gave everyone encouragement too. It was a really great group of people as well in the course both open and supportive."</i></p><p><i>"The tutor was very knowledgeable and kept the class very interested."</i></p><p><i>"I found George to be highly engaging when delivering this class. He was a wonderful teacher who made each and every lesson both interesting funny and thought provoking.</i></p><p><i><i>"I found this course so relatable and interesting and each week I feel like I really took a lot out of it and couldn’t wait for the following week to continue with the next lesson. I felt like the lessons related totally to what was happening in my life and I gained many useful tools/ thoughts to help in my day to day. I wish this course was longer. I didn’t want it to end."</i></i></p><p><i><i>"Great teacher. Very clear and structured course, tackling a difficult topic."</i></i></p><p><i><strong>Avoid disappointment.
