    <p>Life is filled with lessons...</p> 
    <p>Mistakes, moments of glory, relationships and challenges teach us about ourselves, others and the world around us.</p> 
    <p>And, there are many exciting layers of discovery awaiting your attention beneath your everyday life — important insights you can illuminate by exploring your past lives, in-between lives, even your interplanetary lives (lives you’ve lived in non-earthly realms).</p> 
    <p>Sounds pretty <em>far out</em>, doesn’t it?</p> 
    <p>But when you view these lives — the full trajectory of your soul’s journey — with a renowned psychologist and regression therapist like Dr. Linda Backman, you start to realize there just might be something to this.</p> 
    <p>Dr. Backman has guided hundreds to discover and embrace, <em>or release</em>, their many lives — transforming their relationships, work and service in the world.</p> 
    <p>Like thousands of therapists in the field of past life regression, she’s witnessed remarkable information sourced from past lives. This body of research makes it clear that we design scenarios that help us to recreate (and clear) the patterns from our soul’s past.</p> 
    <p>When you unveil your past lives by understanding how they show up in this lifetime and discover how to work with them, you <strong>throw open a door to a whole new level of living</strong>. You start to <strong>understand your relationships, health challenges, losses and life ambitions at a soul level</strong>. </p> 
    <p>We all have karma, Dr. Backman assures us, yet, we also have free will and can rewrite our soul agreements. Through exploring your past lives, you gain insights that can help you recognize your karmic patterns <em>and</em> how you can mitigate them.</p> 
    <p> <strong>There’s always the opportunity to discover and choose a better way, and in doing so, not only help heal and fulfill your own life, but also find your intended place in the world. </strong> </p> 
    <p>When you look to your past lives for guidance, you also start to understand why you’re so good at doing some things and challenged by others — as well as uncover and joyfully live your life’s purpose.</p> 
    <p>Following the thread of your soul’s evolution — from the time you wrote your first life contract to your current life and beyond — provides you with a deeper experience of your soul and its intentions and desires.</p> 
    <p>This gives you the additional wisdom you need to better heal and awaken in this lifetime, because — as regression therapists contend — despite your soul’s infinite journey through many lifetimes, you evolve in real time through what you’re experiencing now.</p> 
    <h3>Discover Your Immortal Soul Archetype</h3>

    <p>One of the most fascinating discoveries you’ll make in <em>The Soul Evolution Intensive</em> is that you have an <em>immortal soul archetype</em>, a particular essence as well as characteristics and qualities you originally came into being with and which remain your core nature throughout all your lives. </p> 
    <p>Before you began your first incarnation as a “young” soul, you selected your soul archetype or style through discussion with your spiritual guides. And getting to know and understand this “soul self” can provide you with <strong>a clearer perspective on how and why you show up the way you do in this life</strong>, how you lived in past lives, as well as the choices you make this time around.</p> 
    <p>Life is a continuous cycle, beginning at birth, ending upon death — and reviewed between lives in the spiritual realm. Your life starts anew with each incarnation, propelled by your soul’s innate desire and inclination to progress in wisdom from one lifetime to the next.</p> 
    <p>During this transformative 6-month intensive, Dr. Backman will guide you in discovering your immortal soul archetype by helping you to recognize your unique archetypal energy from among seven archetypal soul rays (or types).</p> 
    <p> <strong>You’ll learn how your soul archetype holds your essential divine energy of self-determination and inclination toward self-sustainment</strong>. And you’ll discover how this unique energy remains constant and purposeful — throughout your lifetimes — for the sake of your soul’s evolution as well as humanity’s transformation.</p> 
    <h3>Unveil Your Soul’s Journey With an Expert in the Field</h3>

    <p>In <em>The Soul Evolution Intensive</em>, renowned author, psychologist and regression therapist Dr. Linda Backman will take you on a profound inner journey in which you’ll deeply examine the elements and experiences of your current life, past lives, between lives and even interplanetary lives.</p> 
    <p>You’ll discover <strong>how your many lives are affecting you today</strong>, how to find and connect with your soul’s “team” of spirit guides, the soul contracts you’ve created, and how your life — this time around — fits into the whole of humanity.</p> 
    <p>Dr. Backman will also help you to discern if you’re a soul that has experienced interplanetary incarnations — and how to recognize if your loved ones have, and how this can play into personality formation and relationship dynamics.</p> 
    <p>You’ll explore what happens between lives as you transition from one life to the next, including how <strong>your soul navigates into a higher realm with the help of loving ancestors and other spirit guides as it safely finds its way to its next incarnation</strong>. </p> 
    <p>You’ll also delve deeply into learning to <strong>truly trust your intuition and </strong> how your intuition, along with your insightful tracking of the key events of your life can reveal <strong>important clues about the intentions and learning you need to evolve your soul this time around </strong> and in future lifetimes.</p> 
    <p>Through the 19 sessions of this 6-month intensive, you’ll have the time to dive deeply into your exploration of your soul’s journey — an exploration that can unveil the deeper reasons for your being, relationships you choose, losses, illnesses, financial woes (as well as the joys and triumphs!) you experience.</p> 
    <p>You’ll enter <strong>a bigger adventure than your single lifetime</strong>, as you uncover the larger trajectory you’ve been on throughout all your lives, and you’ll <strong>greatly expand the scope of your identity, sense of purpose and entire life path</strong>. </p> 
    <p>Dr. Backman’s approach to soul exploration is not religious. She bases her understanding of soul evolution on vast professional research and decades of case studies.</p> 
    <p>As a clinical psychologist and regression therapist, she’s worked with hundreds of clients, assisting them in experiencing past life regressions and aiding them in using their discoveries and new understandings to help heal past wounds, <strong>mitigate karma and live more freely and fully</strong>. </p>

      <li> <strong>The reasons you were born into your particular birth family</strong> </li> 
      <li>How to discover indicators of your past lives in elements of your current life, including your <em>karma</em> (imbalances or missteps) and <em>dharma</em> (you soul’s overriding intention)</li> 
      <li> <strong>Your purposeful relationships and health issues and what they tell you about your past lives</strong> </li> 
      <li>What steps you can take to let go of past life trauma and to carry forward past life accomplishments</li>

      <li> <strong>Insights into whether you’re an Earth-based or Interplanetary Soul</strong> </li> 
      <li>There is an afterlife in the higher realm that has been “mapped” through 10,000 or more regressions</li> 
      <li>Your passions and how to expand them to understand why you are here now</li> 
      <li>How to recognize the source of your dis-ease, which holds you back from life’s progress</li>

    <p>To help you experience this important work in a way that provides lasting results, Dr. Backman uses both right-brain and left-brain approaches. You’ll tap into your intuition, emotions and feelings, yet also ground these insights into a deeper understanding and shifting of unbeneficial behaviors and patternings to help you <strong>escape stuck places and thrive</strong>. </p> 
    <p>Linda brings great discernment, hard-earned wisdom and a curious spirit to these explorations of the outer limits of our human experience. She offers a profoundly empowering view of the nature of our soul evolution over time.</p> 
    <p>If you’re wanting to <strong>better understand your life and its unfolding, gain insights into why you’re here this time around </strong> and how you can clear karma, heal past wounds, and live more purposely and joyfully, then you won’t want to miss this deep and expansive journey into the mysterious realms of your soul’s evolution.</p>

      <p>Life is a continuous cycle, beginning at birth, ending upon death — and reviewed between lives in the spiritual realm. You life starts anew with each incarnation, propelled by your soul’s innate desire and inclination to progress in wisdom from one lifetime to the next.</p> 
      <p>Your incarnate soul is a fragment, a sliver, of the totality of your divine energy or higher self. The aspect of soul that is “you” comes from — and remains connected to — the celestial realm during your life on Earth. Then, upon your physical death, the holographic portion of your soul that arrived before birth takes its leave and returns to the spiritual realm. Incarnations come and go, while your soul consciousness is eternal. </p> 
      <p>You are also an intuitive being, this innate skill being visual, emotion-based, physical, auditory and/or cognitive. As you examine the key events on your Life Line, you’ll start to realize what you’ve intended to release and to learn in your life today, enhancing your soul’s evolution.</p> 
      <p>During these weeks, you’ll explore:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>What a soul is and how various spiritual traditions define it</li> 
       <li>Your intuitive capabilities, whether they are visual, emotion-based, physical, auditory, and/or cognitive, and how you can deepen and regularly use them</li> 
       <li>How to track the key events on your Life Line and what they reveal about the intentions and learning you need in your life today</li> 
       <li>How to balance and integrate your perspectives on life, based on religious and spiritual beliefs about what the soul is</li> 
       <li>Indicators in your first 5-10 years of life that define who you are as a soul — and why you are here now</li> 
       <li>The reasons you were born into your particular birth family </li> 
      </ul>

      <p>Your soul travels a gradual journey from one life to the next to evolve as an individual and as a collective. Throughout your lives, you may need to traverse challenging mountains to reach your goals — sometimes falling short, other times achieving your desires. Yet, some of your lives may be more like a Sunday afternoon drive, with gentle intentions and pleasant outcomes. The point is: Incarnation is a requirement of the higher realm to “grow” as a soul, affecting soul advancement and the wisdom of ALL. </p> 
      <p>By “mending” your soul through reincarnation, the “seam” of your ongoing soul evolution will be tightly woven through the knowledge and release of who you’ve been as well as your chosen actions. Relationships and health issues shed light on our past life events, including what we need to heal today. Through ongoing balance and healing of what has come before, we evolve as a soul.</p> 
      <p>During these weeks, you’ll discover:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>The essential nature of reincarnation and your higher self </li> 
       <li>How life on Earth evolved from the time of Homo sapiens until now</li> 
       <li>How to discover indicators of your past lives in elements of your current life, including your <em>karma</em> (imbalances or missteps) and <em>dharma</em> (you soul’s overriding intention)</li> 
       <li>How to recognize unresolved past life and current life circumstances</li>

      <p>Each of us, as a soul, has a “team” of spiritual guides. One of the members of this team is our <em>primary soul guide</em>. Many attribute their “sense of direction” to guidance they perceive through a guardian angel, an animal, a loved one, or simply a power or force. Our higher self, or our soul energy that remains in the divine realm when we are incarnate, can and often does serve as guidance. Widows and widowers have reported through Gallup Poll research that they feel the essence of and support from their spouse.</p> 
      <p>We are never alone and always supported. The key is learning to trust and use our intuition to receive input from the higher realm. Guides provide us with options, yet never force a decision. They may also lead us to a life circumstance they believe we need or to a tough decision to help our soul evolve.</p> 
      <p>During these weeks, you’ll discover:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>How to recognize when a guide or guiding force is communicating with you in your everyday life</li>

      <p>There is a simple, yet complex, truth about soul evolution: your soul has an overarching intention that carries over from one lifetime to the next. And, each life has a separate blueprint that expands and enhances your soul progress.</p> 
      <p>The farther up the ladder of soul development you climb, the more you have in the creation of your life blueprint. And, at the same time, each incarnation becomes more complex and challenging. Just as when you’re a sixth grader versus a second grader, you have greater ability to work independently on increasingly complicated projects. </p> 
      <p>Also, in each incarnation, you’re a composite of three aspects: your soul energy, the perpetual foundation that remains unchanged from life to life; your life blueprint, rewritten from one life to the next to further your soul’s progress; and a chosen body with a specific human personality, to which you are attached and supportive of, and which is designed intentionally to help you achieve the agreed-upon goals of your life blueprint this time around. </p>

      <p>All souls have a unique archetypal energy, unchanging throughout all lifetimes and purposeful for the sake of individual soul evolution and humanity’s transformation. There are seven equally important archetypal <em>soul rays</em> (or types) — beginning with the essential divine energy of self-determination to advance a culture and build on one another toward self-sustainment.</p> 
      <p>Your soul archetype is determined at the outset of your soul’s nascence and it has a flavor — distinct, ageless and fixed.

      <p>Reincarnation explains how our past life karma or misdeeds, and our dharma or accomplishments, show up in life today to be embraced and healed.

      <p>Each of our incarnations are planned pre-birth with the “double intent,” to embrace our past accomplishments, or dharma, and to experience elements of a new embodiment to release karma, or past missteps. As a soul, the “Law of Evolution” is that we’re expected to expand to higher levels of wisdom and integrity. In this May 2017 presentation, Dr. Linda Backman shares her 24 years of regression client learning via our deep dives, lifetime to lifetime, to evolve, both in Earth and interplanetary lives to aid humanity’s need to expand.</p>

      <p>This guided meditation is intended for you to communicate with one of your spiritual guides. You may sense a new guide or one you’ve known before. You’ll be using your intuition to sense your guide, whether through vision, emotion or simply thought. The purpose of your connection with one of your benevolent spiritual guides is to ask a question. You may wish to ask about your current life purpose, a decision you’re facing in life today or the meaning of a circumstance in your life.</p>

      <p>In this interview, Stanislav Grof and Rick Tarnas explore the extraordinary value of archetypal astrology for work with non-ordinary (holotropic) states of consciousness induced by psychedelics and various non-drug means. They share observations and experiences from their joint research that began more than 30 years ago at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California. To their great surprise, archetypal astrology proved to be what Stan called "the Rosetta Stone for consciousness research" after all conventional tools of psychiatry and psychology proved essentially useless for this purpose.</p>

    <h3>What People Are Saying About Dr. Linda Backman...</h3> 
    <div class="s30"></div> 
    <p>Linda Backman’s <em>Soul Evolution</em> course affirmed for me so many thoughts about my own purpose in life. It empowered me to trust more deeply my own intuition and imagination as spiritual guidance, as well as recognizing the awesome responsibility to grow my soul for the evolution of all creation. All is One, indeed! <br> <strong><em> — Patricia Withers</em></strong><em>, Chicago, Illinois</em> </p> 
    <p>"When the student is ready, the teacher appears." Linda Backman was that teacher for me. I was able to advance my knowledge about my own soul’s evolution... I also feel ready to explore my karma and fulfill my life plan more effectively. <br> <strong><em> — Anonymous</em> </strong> </p> 
    <p>I joined the course after being diagnosed with cancer. The course gave me thoughts to pursue regarding the purpose this disease serves in my 75-year-old life. <br> <strong><em> — JoAna</em></strong><em>, Solola, Guatemala</em> </p> 
    <p>Linda and The Shift Network, thanks for a great learning experience that combined spiritual wisdom with very practical insights. <br> <strong><em> — James Alexander</em></strong><em>, Silver Spring, Maryland</em> </p> 
    <p>This course helped me understand my birth family and how I was so different. It helped solidify that my different (i.e. misunderstood) ways really have a value in the family and in society. <br> <strong><em> — Ellen</em></strong><em>, Chapel Hill, North Carolina </em> </p> 
    <p>The <em>Soul Evolution</em> course helped explain why certain events happened in my life. I also left each class feeling calm and peaceful. I plan on sharing the guidance with friends I share like values with. <br> <strong><em> — Sandy Edmonton</em></strong><em>, Alberta, Canada</em> </p> 
    <p>I am grateful to have visited my council and being told I can work on this problem of "wisdom!" Because of the [sessions with Linda], I have been thinking more about how best to go about this work. One positive result has been my awaking to the knowledge I actually have my own guide and have had for eons! <br>— <strong><em>Sylvia D</em></strong>.</p> 
    <p>I was depressed and suicidal after my daughter’s death... I have been a different person ever since [I had my session with Linda]. I visited with my daughter, who helped me with things I needed to know. She helped me to see why it all happened...<br> — <em><strong>Brina H</strong></em>.</p> 
    <p>In my [session with Linda], I went up into the clouds and was surrounded by a group of spiritual beings, headed by one who wore a crown with a very large ruby jewel in the front. I was suspended horizontally in the middle to receive healing. I now take myself there whenever I can...<br> — <em><strong>Margot B</strong></em>.</p> 
    <p>...Linda’s ability to draw out of people what has been buried or repressed is remarkable and it is no wonder that she is in great demand. I would recommend [her work] highly if this is an area of interest for you. <br>— <em><strong>Bryn</strong></em></p>

I can honestly say, that this work has changed my life, and that of many of the people I have regressed. If you are considering taking this <em>Soul Evolution </em> course, I don’t think you would be able to find a better teacher than Dr. Backman. <br> <em><strong> — Marilyn Kaufman</strong>, Ontario, Canada</em></p>

    <p>[Working with Linda] was a wake up call for me, and made me realize I needed to reconnect with this life in order to finish what I’m supposed to be doing here. I’ve had a glimpse of what’s waiting at the end of this road, and it’s more wonderful than I could have imagined. <br> <strong><em> — Diann R.</em> </strong> </p> 
    <p>What stands out to me [from my work with Linda] is the message that I am humble in my life here, but in the spirit world I am big and powerful (in a beautiful way). I have limited power in this life so as not to overwhelm people around me — so I can function in society. <br> <strong><em> — Lara P.</em> </strong> </p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> 
    <p> <strong>Q: What is a virtual course?</strong> <br> A: It’s a great way to engage live teachings and each other from the comfort of your home! All you need is a phone line (or an equivalent voice service). If there is more than one person in your household taking the course, you will each need your own line. We use MaestroConference to make it just like an in-person event, where you can ask questions, participate in groups, and deepen your exploration of the course themes.</p> 
    <p>Please note that dialing MaestroConference from your phone is a regular toll call to California; your telephone service provider will charge you according to your existing long-distance calling plan. Other options include calling cards and discount long-distance carriers. You can also use Skype to connect to MaestroConference at no charge, and we offer a webcast which is free to use from anywhere in the world.</p> 
    <p><em>I have never participated before in an online course. The packaging, presentation, inclusion and Facebook postings created a wonderful, safe cocoon to participate. I haven’t seen a course so well put together ever — not in all the years of taking college classes — and I had my doubts about doing an online course. The wealth of organization and ease of learning materials and support made this fun as well.</em> <br> <strong> – Claudia F., Medford, MA</strong> </p> 
    <p> <strong>Q: Can I get benefit from the course if I miss the live classes?</strong> <br>A: Absolutely! You can download the recordings and transcripts of all course sessions from our online media archive, so you never need to worry about missing live calls. You can also engage the full community and leaders on our private community website.</p> 
    <p> <strong>Q: Can you tell me about the Private Course Group?</strong> <br>A: We will have a private community group for all course participants on Facebook that will support you in making connections with others, sharing insights, engaging in discussions, completing homework assignments and exchanging information about events and other activities that can supplement your transformational journey. You’ll have the ability to share your experiences, projects and growth throughout the Course.</p> 
    <p> <strong>Q: Are there scholarships available for this Training?</strong> <br>A: Yes, we always make a certain percentage of spaces available for partial scholarships, giving preference to those in developing countries or doing important but underpaid work to which they can apply the training material immediately.
