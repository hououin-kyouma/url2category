  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">PREFACE</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book has been made possible by the generosity of a Student who is a member of The United Lodge of Theosophists. The matter in it appeared in the Magazine Theosophy, published by that Lodge, in various issues from November, 1913, to February, 1917. Notes upon chapters One to Seven, inclusive, were written by William Q. Judge, and were first printed in his magazine The Path, appearing in various numbers from 1887 to 1895. These Notes by Mr. Judge were signed “William Brehon, F. T. S.,” or “William Brehon”—pen names used by Mr. Judge. The Notes for the remaining eleven Chapters were written by a Student of William Q. Judge, one who was personally taught by him and whose explanations and comments will be found in accord with the spirit and genius of his Teacher.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No attempt has been made to alter or revise Mr. Judge’s Notes so that they may be in “book form.” Quite often Mr. Judge devoted several articles, appearing in several different numbers of The Path, to a consideration of a single Gita Chapter, and the reader of this book wilt note that fact as he peruses its pages. The compilers have inserted rules to show where one such article leaves off and another begins. The reader will note the initials “W. B.” or “B.” signed to some of the footnotes: these stand for “William Brehon” or “Brehon,” and were written, of course, by Mr. Judge.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The form and size of this book are designed to conform to that of Mr. Judge’s rendering of the Bhagavad-Gita itself, which has been found so convenient by thousands of students.</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the title of this sacred Hindu poem were paraphrased, it would read: </font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holy Song of God Himself, who, at the beginning of Kali yuga or the dark age, descended upon earth to aid and instruct Man. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GITA means song, and BHAGAVAD is one of the names of Krishna. Krishna was an Avatar. According to the views of the Brahmins, we are now in Kali-yuga, which began about the time of Krishna's appearance. He is said to have descended in order to start among men those moral and philosophical ideas which were necessary to be known during the revolution of the Age, at the end of which&#x2015;after a brief period of darkness&#x2015;a better Age will begin. </font></span> </p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The composition of this poem is attributed to Vyasa and, as he is also said to have given the Vedas to men, a discussion about dates would not be profitable and can well stand over until some other occasion. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype">2</span></font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><cite> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Bhagavad-Gita</font></span></cite></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3"> is a portion of the </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><cite> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Mahabharata,</font></span></cite><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3"> the great epic of India. The </font><cite> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Mahabharata </font> </span></cite><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">is so called because it contains the general history of the house of Bharat, and the prefix </font> </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.0pt"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Maha </font></span> </em><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">signifies great. Its more definite object, however, is to give an account of the wars of the Kurus and Pandus, two great branches of the family. And that portion included in our poem is the sublime philosophical and metaphysical dialogue held by </font></span> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Krishna with Arjuna, on the eve of a battle between the two aspirants for dominion. </font></span> </p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene of the battle is laid on the plain called “Kurukshetra,” a strip of land near Delhi, between the Indus, the Ganges, and the Himalayan mountains. Many European translators and commentators, being ignorant of the psychological system of the Hindus&#x2015;which really underlies every word of this poem &#x2015; have regarded this plain and the battle as just those two things and no more; some have gone so far as to give the commercial products of the country at the supposed period, so that readers might be able, forsooth, in that way to know the motives that prompted the two princes to enter into a bloody internecine conflict. No doubt such a conflict did take place, for man is continually imitating the higher</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype">3</span></font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> spiritual planes; and a great sage could easily adopt a human event in order to erect a noble philosophical system upon such an allegorical foundation. </font> </span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one aspect history gives us merely the small or great occurrences of man's progress; but in another, any one great historical epoch will give us a picture of the evolution in man, in the mass, of any corresponding faculty of the Individual Soul. So we see, here and there, Western minds wondering why such a highly tuned metaphysical discussion should be “disfigured by a warfare of savages.” Such is the materializing influence of Western culture that it is hardly able to admit any higher meaning in a portion of the poem which confessedly it has not yet come to fully understand. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the Upanishads can be properly rendered, the Indian psychological system must be understood; and even when its existence is admitted, the English speaking person will meet the great difficulty arising from an absence of words in that language which correspond to the ideas so frequently found in the Sanskrit. Thus we have to wait until a new set of words has been born to express the new ideas not yet existing in the civilization of the West. </font></span> </p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The location of the plain on which this battle</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype">4</span></font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">was fought is important, as well as are also the very rivers and mountains by which it is bounded. And as equally needful to be understood, or at least guessed at, are the names of the respective princes. The very place in the </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><cite> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Mahabharata </font> </span></cite></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">in which this episode is inserted has deep significance, and we cannot afford to ignore anything whatever that is connected with the events. If we merely imagine that Vyasa or </font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> Krishna</font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3"> took the sacred plain of Kurukshetra and the great battle as simply accessories to his discourse, which we can easily discard, the whole force of the dialogue will be lost. Although the </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><cite> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Bhagavad-Gita </font> </span></cite></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">is a small work, there have been written upon it, among the Hindus, more commentaries than those upon the </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><cite> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Revelation </font> </span></cite><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">of </font></span> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">St. John among the Christians. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not intend to go into those commentaries, because on the one hand I am not a Sanskrit scholar, and on the other it would not tend to great profit. Many of them are fanciful, some unwarrantable; and those that are of value can be consulted by anyone anxious to pursue that line of inquiry. What I propose here to myself and to all who may read these papers is to study the </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><cite> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Bhagavad-</font></span></cite></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><cite><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"> <font size="3">5</font></span></cite></p> 
  <p align="justify"><cite><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"> <font size="3">Gita </font></span></cite> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">by the light of that spiritual lamp — be it small or great — which the Supreme Soul will feed and increase within us if we attend to its behests and diligently inquire after it. Such at least is the promise by Krishna</font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3"> in the </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><cite> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Bhagavad-Gita</font></span></cite></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3"> &#x2015; the “Song Celestial.”—</font></p> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015;&#x2015; </font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the few introductory lines with which I took up this subject, it was stated that not being a Sanskrit scholar I did not intend to go into the commentaries upon the poem in that language. The great mass of those commentaries have looked at the dialogue from various standpoints. Many later Hindu students have not gone beyond the explanations made by Sankaracharya, and nearly all refuse to do more than transliterate the names of the different personages referred to in the first chapter. </font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is the highest authority for reading this poem between the lines. The Vedas themselves say that what we see of them is only “the disclosed Veda,” and that one should strive to get above this </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">disclosed </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">word. It is here clearly implied that the undisclosed Vedas must be hidden or contained in that which is apparent to the outer senses. Did we not have this privilege, then surely would we be reduced</font></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">6</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">to obtaining true knowledge solely from the facts of experience as suffered by the mortal frame, and fall into the gross error of the materialists who claim that mind is only an effect produced by the physical brain-molecules coming into motion. We would also have to follow the canonical rule, that conscience is a safe guide only when it is regulated by an external law such as the law of the church, or of the Brahmanical caste. But we very well know that within the material, apparent&#x2015;or disclosed &#x2015; man, exists the </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">real </font></span> </em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">one who is undisclosed. </font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This valuable privilege of looking for the inner sense, while not straining after impossible meanings in the text, is permitted to all sincere students of any holy scriptures, Christian or Pagan. And in the poem itself, Krishna declares that he will feed the lamp of spiritual wisdom so that the real meaning of his words may be known; so too the Upanishads uphold the existence of a faculty together with the right to use it, whereby one can plainly discern the real, or undisclosed, meaning of holy books. Indeed, there is a school of occultists who hold, as we think with reason, that this power may be so developed by devoted persons, that even upon hearing the words of a holy book read in a totally un-</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">7</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">familiar language, the true meaning and drift of the strange sentences become instantly known. <sup> <span style="color: #000080; font-weight:700">(1)</span></sup> The Christian commentators all allow that in studying their Bible the spirit must be attended to and not the letter. This </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">spirit </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">is that </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">undisclosed </font> </span></em><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Veda which must be looked for between the lines. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor should the Western student of the poem be deterred from any attempt to get at the real meaning by the attitude of the Brahmins, who hold that only Brahmins can be told this real meaning, and, because Krishna did not make it plain, it may not be made plain now to Sudras, or low caste people. Were this view to prevail, then the whole Western body of students would be excluded from using this important book, inasmuch as all persons not Hindus are necessarily of Sudra caste. Krishna did not make such an exclusion, which is only priestcraft. He was himself of shepherd caste and not a Brahmin; and he says that anyone who listens to his words will receive great benefit. The sole limitation made by him is that one in which he declares that these things must not be taught to those who do not want</span></font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"><br> </font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype"> —————————————————————————————————————————————<br> </font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><sup> <span style="color: #000080"><font size="3"><b>(1)</b></font></span></sup><font size="3"> </font></span><font color="#800000" size="2"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype">&nbsp;</span></font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="2">We have in mind an incident where a person of some slight development in this direction, heard read several verses from the Vedas in Sanskrit&#x2015;with which he had no acquaintance&#x2015;and instantly told what the verses were about. </font> </span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">8</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> to listen, which is just the same direction as that given by Jesus of Nazareth when he said, "cast not your pearls before swine." </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as our minds work very much upon suggestion or clues and might, in the absence of any hints as to where those clues are placed, be liable to altogether overlook the point, we must bear in mind the existence among the Aryans of a psychological system that gives substance and impulse to utterances declared by many Orientalists to be folly unworthy of attention from a man of the nineteenth century civilization. Nor need we be repulsed from our task because of a small acquaintance with that Aryan psychology. The moment we are aware of its existence in the poem, our inner self is ready to help the outer man to grasp after it; and in the noble pursuit of these great philosophical and moral truths, which is only our eternal endeavor to realize them as a part of our being, we can patiently wait for a perfect knowledge of the anatomy and functions of the inner man. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Western Sanskritists have translated many important words into the very lowest of their real meanings, being drawn away from the true by the incomplete Western psychological and spiritual knowledge, or have mixed them</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">9</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">up hopelessly. Such words as </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">karma</font></span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3"> and </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">dharma </font> </span></em><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">are not understood. </font> <em><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Dharma </font> </span></em><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">means </font></span> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14.0pt"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">law</font></span></em><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">, and is generally turned into </font><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">duty, </font></span> </em><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">or said to refer merely to some rule depending upon human convention, whereas it means an inherent property of the faculties or of the whole man, or even of anything in the cosmos. Thus it is said that it is the duty, or dharma, of fire to burn. It always will burn and thus do its whole duty, having no consciousness, while man alone has the power to retard his "journey to the heart of the Sun," by refusing to perform his properly appointed and plainly evident dharma. So again, when we read in the </font><cite><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> Bhagavad-Gita </font></span></cite><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">that those who depart this life "in the bright half of the moon, in the six months of the sun's northern course," will go to eternal salvation, while others, "who depart in the gloomy night of the moon's dark season while the sun is in the southern half of his path," ascend for a time to the moon's region, to be reborn on this earth, our Orientalists tell us this is sheer folly, and we are unable to contradict them. But if we know that the Aryans, with a comprehensive knowledge of the vast and never inharmonious correspondence reigning throughout the macrocosm, in speaking thus meant to admit that the human</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">10</font></span></p>

The materialistic critic will take the verse in the fourth chapter, which says that “he who eats of the ambrosia left from a sacrifice passes into the supreme spirit,” and ask us how the eating of the remnants of a burnt offering can confer salvation. When, however, we know that Man is the altar and the sacrifice, and that this </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">ambrosia </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">is the </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">perfection of spiritual cultivation </font></span></em> <font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">which he eats or incorporates into his being, the Aryan is vindicated and we are saved from despair. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strange similarity on one point may be noticed between our poem and the old Hebrew record. The Jews were prepared by certain experiences to enter into the promised land, but were unable to do so until they had engaged in mighty conflicts with Hivites, Jebusites, Perizzites, and Amalekites. Here we find that the very opening verse signalizes a war. The old, blind king Dhritarashtra asks his prime minister to tell him what these opposing forces of Pandus and Kurus have been doing assembled as they are resolved upon war. So too the Jews assembled upon the borders of the promised land, resolved on conflict, and sustained in their resolve by the declarations</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">11</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> of their God who had brought them out of the darkness of Egypt, carried on the fight. Egypt was the place where they had, in mystic language, obtained corporification, and stands for antenatal states, for unformed chaotic periods in the beginning of evolution, for the gestation in the womb.

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Sanskrit, the first chapter is called “Arjuna-Vishada,” which in English means, “The despair and despondency of Arjuna.” Some have called it “The Survey of Army”; but while truly an army is surveyed, that is not the essential meaning intended. It is the result of the survey we are to consider; and that result upon Arjuna who is the person most interested&#x2015;the one who is the chief questioner and beneficiary throughout the whole action of the poem&#x2015;is despondency. </font></span></p>

One of them consists of all his friends and relations who do not view life as he does, who are wedded to the "established order," and think him a fool for devoting any attention to anything else; while the general mass of his acquaintances and those whom he meets in the world instinctively array themselves against one who is thus starting upon a crusade that begins with his own</font></span></p>

The other opponents are far more difficult to meet, because they have their camp and base of action upon the Astral and other hidden planes; they are all his lower tendencies and faculties, that up to this time have been in the sole service of material life. By the mere force of moral gravity, they fly to the other side, where they assist his living friends and relatives in their struggle against him. They have more efficiency in producing despondency than anything else. In the poem, it is referred to in the words addressed by Arjuna to Krishna: </font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I am not able to stand; for my understanding, as it were turneth round, and I behold inauspicious omens on all sides.”</span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of us are brought to this study by our own request made to our higher self, who is Krishna. Arjuna requested Krishna to be his charioteer, and to drive him forth between the two armies. It does not matter whether he now is consciously aware of having made the request, nor whether it was made as a specific act, in this life or in many another precedent one; </font><span style="font-family: Arial"> <em><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">it was made and it is to be answered at</font></span></em></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><em><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"> <font size="3">&nbsp;the right time. </font></span></em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Some of us have asked this many times before, in ancient births of ours in other bodies and other lands; others are making the request now; but it is more than likely in the case of those who are spurred on to intense effort and longing to know the truth, and to strive for unity with God, that they have put up the petition ages since. So now Krishna, the charioteer of this body with its horses&#x2015;the mind&#x2015;drives us forth so that we may stand with our higher self and all the tendencies connected with it on one side, and all the lower (but not all necessarily evil) principles on the other. The student may, perhaps, with ease face the crowd of friends and relatives, having probably gone through that experience in other lives and is now proof against it, but he is not proof against the first dark shadow of despair and ill result that falls upon him. Every elemental that he has vivified by evil thinking now casts upon him the thought, “After all, it is no use; I cannot win; if I did, the gain would be nothing; I can see no great or lasting result to be attained, for all, all, is impermanent.” </font></span></p>

The rosy hue of dawn does not reach round the world; it chases darkness. Let us be prepared for it, not only at the first stage, but all along in our progress to the holy seat; for it comes at each pause; at that slight pause when we are about to begin another breath, to take another step, to pass into another condition. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here it is wise, turning to the 18th, and last, chapter of the poem, to read the words of the immortal master of life: </font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “From a confidence in thine own self-sufficiency thou mayest think that thou wilt not fight. Such is a fallacious determination, <em>for the principles of thy nature will compel thee</em><i>. </i>Being confined to actions by the duties of thy natural calling, </font><font size="3"> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype">thou wilt involuntarily do that from necessity</span></em></span></font><font size="3" face="Palatino Linotype"><i>, </i>which thou wantest through ignorance to avoid. ”</font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this, Krishna uses the very argument advanced by Arjuna against the fight, as one in its favor. In the chapter we are considering, Arjuna repeats the old Brahmanical injunction against those who break up the “eternal institutions of caste and tribe,” for, as he says, the penalty annexed is a sojourn in hell, since, when the caste and tribe are destroyed, the ancestors, being deprived of the rites of</font></span></p>

But Krishna shows, as above, that each man is naturally, by his bodily tendencies, compelled to do the acts of some particular calling, and that body with its tendencies is merely the manifestation of what the inner man is, as the result of all his former thoughts up to that incarnation. So he is forced by nature's law&#x2015;which is his own&#x2015;to be born just where he must have the experience that is needed. And Arjuna, being a warrior, is compelled to fight, whether he will or no. </font></span> <font size="3"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype">In another chapter, the institution of caste is more particularly referred to, and there we</span></font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"><br> </font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype"> —————————————————————————————————————————————<br> </font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><sup> <span style="color: #000080; font-weight:700"><font size="3">(1)</font></span></sup><font size="3"> </font><font size="2">This reference by Arjuna is to the immemorial custom of the son, or descendants, offering to the departed, at stated times, funeral-cakes and water, called "Sraddha and Pinda"&#x2015;one of the so-called superstitions of the Hindus. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="2"> It has always been a grave question with me whether the boasted "freedom from superstitions" of Western 19th century civilization is an unmixed good, or any evidence of real progress. All such ancient forms have been swept away, and with them nearly every vestige of true religious feeling, leaving only an unquenchable thirst for money and power. In the present ignorance of the true reason at the bottom of these forms, the assertion is made that they mean nothing whatever. But in the Catholic church it is continued, and to some extent believed in, as is shown in their masses for the dead; surely these masses would not be offered if supposed to have no effect on the state of those for whom they are offered. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="2"> Although greatly corrupted and debased, it is in this church alone that these old practices are preserved. <em>Sraddha</em> and<i> <em>Pinda</em> </i>are now neglected, because the inner constitution of man, and the constitution of the macrocosm, are not understood in such a way as to make the ceremony of the slightest use. &#x2015;W.B.</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As stated in the last paper, the substratum, or support, for the whole cosmos, is the presiding spirit, and all the various changes in life, whether of a material nature or solely in mental states, are cognizable because the presiding spirit within is not modifiable. Were it otherwise, then we would have no memory, for with each passing event, we, becoming merged in it, could not remember anything, that is, we would see no changes. There must therefore be something eternally persisting, which is the witness and perceiver of every passing change, itself unchangeable. All objects, and all states of what Western philosophers call mind, are modifications, for in order to be seen or known by us, there must be some change, either partial or total, from a precedent state. The perceiver of these changes is the inner man&#x2015;Arjuna-Krishna. </font></span> </p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This leads us to the conviction that there must be a universal presiding spirit, the producer as well as the spectator, of all this collection of animate and inanimate things.

But, resolving to create, or rather to emanate the universe, IT formed a picture of what should be, and this at once was a modification willingly brought about in the hitherto wholly unmodified spirit; thereupon the divine Idea was gradually expanded, coming forth into objectivity; while the essence of the presiding spirit remained unmodified, and became the perceiver of its own expanded idea. Its modifications are visible (and invisible) nature. Its essence then differentiates itself continually in various directions, becoming the immortal part of each man&#x2015;the Krishna who talks to Arjuna. Coming like a spark from the central fire, it partakes of that nature, that is, the quality of being unmodifiable, and assumes to itself&#x2015;as a cover, so to speak&#x2015;the human body <sup> <span style="color: #000080; font-weight:700">(1)</span></sup> and thus, being in essence unmodified, it has the capacity to perceive all the changes going on around the body. </font></span></p>

It is for each man; and it is in that way we have so far considered it. Some have called it obscure, and others a book which deals solely with the great principles of nature; with only great questions of cosmogony; with difficult and bewildering questions relating to the first cause; and still others think it is contradictory and vague. But this first scene in the great colloquy is plain. It has the din of arms, the movement of battalions and the disposition of forces with their generals. No one need feel any hesitation now, for we are face to face with ourselves. The weak man, or he who does not care for truth no matter where it leads, had better shut the book now. Unless he can go on reading the poem with the fixed intention of applying it to himself, it will do him no good whatever. He may say, however, that he will read it for what it may seem to contain, but if he reads to the end of time and does not fairly regard this first lecture, his knowledge gained further on will be no knowledge.

It would have been easier to have made them sit down for a philosophical discourse beforehand in which reasons pro and con regarding any battle would be discussed, and then, after all that was done, to show us Arjuna, encouraged and equipped, entering upon the war sure of victory because he had spent much time in dispelling his doubts. But instead of doing this he pictures the impetuous Arjuna precipitating the battle before he had considered whom it was he had to fight. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not appear in the </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><cite> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Bhagavad-Gita </font> </span></cite></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">that Krishna had induced Arjuna, as was the case, to make the war for the purpose of regaining his kingdom. While stirring him up to it Krishna had wisely refrained from telling that which Arjuna finds out on the first day, that he had to oppose all these friends, kinsmen and preceptors. It was a wise reticence. If we completely apprehended the enormous power of our passions and various tendencies, most of us would throw up the fight in advance; for nothing would persuade us that any power within could withstand against</font></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">30</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> such overwhelming odds. For us then the incitement to fight is found, not so much in any conversation that we hold now with Krishna, but in the impulses which are carried across, again and again, from incarnation to incarnation. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We take up the gage over and over, life after life, in experience after experience, never completely defeated if we always look to Krishna&#x2015;</font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">our higher self. And in the tale of Arjuna we find this also. For in a succeeding book, called </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><cite> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Anugita, </font> </span></cite></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">is an account of the hero walking with Krishna through the Palace of Maya. The battle over, for the time, Arjuna tells his friend that he has really forgotten much that he had told him (in the </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><cite> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Bhagavad-Gita</font></span></cite></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">) and asks for a succinct repetition. This is given to him by the great warrior. </font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The palace of maya is this body of illusion, built up around us by desire. In our last birth we had all the advice given in this poem, and walking today through the palace, which sometimes seems so lovely, we now and then have reminiscences from the past. Sometimes we stoutly take up the fight; but surely, if we have listened to the guide aright, we will compel ourselves at last to carry it out until finished. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">31</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">In coming to the conclusion of this first chapter, we reach the </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">first abyss. </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">It is not the great abyss, albeit it may seem to us, in our experience, to be the greatest. We are now vis-a-vis our own despair, and doubt its companion. Many a student of theosophy has in our own sight reached this point</font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&#x2015;</font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">all true students do. Like a little child who first ventures from the parent's side, we are affrighted at what seems new to us, and dropping our weapons attempt to get away; but, in the pursuit of theosophy it is not possible to go back. </font> </p> 
  <p align="center" style="text-align: justify"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the abyss is behind us.</font></span></em></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is in nature a law that operates in every department whether moral or physical, and which may now be called that of undulation and then that of inhibition; while at other times it reappears as vibration, and still again as attraction and repulsion, but all these changes are only apparent because at bottom it is the same. Among vegetables it causes the sap to flow up the tree in one way and will not permit it to return in the same direction. In our own blood circulation we find the blood propelled from the heart, and that nature has provided little valves which will not permit it to return to the heart by the way it came,</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">32</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">but by the way provided. Medical and anatomical science are not quite sure what it is that causes the blood to pass these valves; whether it is pressure from behind communicated by the heart, or the pressure by atmosphere from without which gently squeezes, as it were, the blood upon its way. But the occultist does not find himself limited by these empirical deductions. He goes at once to the center and declares that the impulse </font><span style="font-family: Arial"> <em><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">is </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">from the heart and that that organ receives its impulse from the great astral heart or the akasa, which has been said by all mystics to have a double motion, or alternate vibration</font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&#x2015;</font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">the systole and diastole of nature. </font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in this sense the valve in the circulation represents the abyss behind us that we cannot repass. We are in the great general circulation and compelled, whether we like it or not, to obey its forward impulse. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This place of dejection of Arjuna is also the same thing as is mentioned in </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><cite> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Light on the Path </font></span></cite></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">as the silence after the storm. In tropical countries this silence is very apparent. After the storm has burst and passed, there is a quietness when the earth and the trees seem to have momentarily ceased making their familiar, manifold noises. They are obeying</font></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">33</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> the general law and beginning the process of assimilation. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the astral world it is just the same. When one enters there for the first time, a great silence falls, during which the regulated soul is imbibing its surroundings and becoming accustomed to them. It says nothing but waits quietly until it has become in vibration precisely the same as the plane in which it is; when that is accomplished then it can speak properly, make itself understood, and likewise understand. But the unregulated soul flies to that plane of the astral world in a disturbed state, hurries to speak before it is able to do so intelligibly and as a consequence is not understood, while it increases its own confusion and makes it less likely that it will soon come to understand. People are attracted to the astral plane; they hear of its wonders and astonishments and like a child with a new toy in sight they hurry to grasp it. They refuse to learn its philosophy because that seems dry and difficult. So they plunge in, and as Murdhna Joti said in a former article in this magazine, they then “swim in it and cut capers like a boy in a pool of water.” </font> </span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">34</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for the earnest student and true disciple the matter is serious. He has vowed to have the truth at whatever cost, willing to go wherever she leads&#x2015;even if it be to death. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Krishna, having got Arjuna to where the battle has really begun, where retreat is not possible, begins to tell his loved disciple and friend what is the philosophy that underlies it all and without which success cannot be compassed. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should not fail to observe at this point, that when Arjuna threw down his bow and arrows, the flying of missiles had already begun. We cannot say that when the philosophical discourse began between these two the opposing forces declared a truce until the mighty heroes should give the signal, because there is nowhere any verse that would authorize it, and we also can read in the accompanying books that all the paraphernalia of war had been brought onto the field and that the enemy would not desist, no matter what Arjuna might do. Now there is a meaning here, which is also a part of the great abyss the son of Pandu saw behind him, and which every one of us also sees. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We enter upon this great path of action in occultism mentally disposed towards final</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">35</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> victory. This mental attitude instantly throws all the parts of our being into agitation, during which the tendencies which are by nature antipathetic to each other separate and range themselves upon opposite sides. This creates great distress, with oftentimes wandering of the mind, and adds additional terror to our dark despair. We may then sink down and declare that we will fly to a forest&#x2015;or as they did once in Europe</font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">, to a monastery</font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&#x2015;</font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">so as to get away from what seems to be unfavorable ground for a conflict. But we have evoked a force in nature and set up a current and vibration which </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">will go on </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">no matter what we do. This is the meaning of the "flying of arrows" even when Arjuna sat down on the bench of his chariot. </font></p> 
  <p align="center" style="text-align: justify"> <font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point of our progress we should </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">examine our motive and desire.</font></span></em></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been said in some theosophical writings of the present day, that a “spiritualized will” ought to be cultivated. As terms are of the highest importance we ought to be careful how we use them, for in the inner life they represent either genuine, regulated forces, or useless and abortive things that lead to nothing but confusion. This term “spiritualized will” leads to error, because in fact it has no</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">36</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">existence. The mistake has grown out of the constant dwelling on “will” and “forces” needed for the production of phenomena, as something the disciple should strive to obtain</font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&#x2015;</font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">whether so confessed or not</font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&#x2015;</font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3"> while the real motive power is lost sight of. It is very essential that we should clearly understand this, for if we make the blunder of attributing to </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">will </font></span> </em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">or to any other faculty an action which it does not have, or of placing it in a plane to which it does not belong, we at once remove ourselves far from the real knowledge, since all action on this plane is by mind alone. </font></p> 
  <p align="center" style="text-align: justify"> <font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old Hermetic statement is: “</font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Behind will stands desire</font></span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">,”</font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> </font></span></em><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">and it is true.</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><em><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"> <font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will </font></span></em> <font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">is a pure, colorless force which is moved into action by </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">desire</font></span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">. If desire does not give a direction, the will is motionless; and just as desire indicates, so the will proceeds to execute. </font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as there are countless wills of sentient beings constantly plying to and fro in our sphere, and must be at all times in some manner acting upon one another, the question arises: What is that sort of knowledge which shows how to use the will so that the effect of counteracting wills may not be felt? That knowledge is lost among the generality of men and is only instinctive here and there in</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> the world as a matter of karmic result, giving us examples of men whose will seems to lead them on to success, as Jay Gould and others. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, men of the world are not desiring to see results which shall be in accord with the general will of nature, because they are wanting this and that for their own benefit. Their desire, then, no matter how strong, is limited or nullified: (1) by lack of knowledge of how to counteract other wills; (2) by being in opposition to the general will of nature without the other power of being able to act strongly in opposition to that too. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it follows</span><font face="Palatino Linotype">—</font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype">as we see in practice in life&#x2015;</span></font><em><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">that men obtain only a portion of that which they desire.</font></span></em><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question next arises: Can a man go against the general will of nature and escape destruction, and also be able to desire wickedly with knowledge, and accomplish, through will, what he wishes? </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a man can do all of these&#x2015;except to escape destruction. That is sure to come, no matter at how remote a period. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He acquires extraordinary knowledge, enabling him to use powers for selfish purposes during immense periods of time, but at last the insidious effects of the opposition to the general</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This fact is the origin of the destruction-of-worlds myths, and of those myths of combats such as between Krishna and Ravana, the demon god, and between Durga and the demons. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For in other ages, as is to again occur in ages to come, these wickedly desiring people, having great knowledge, increase to an enormous extent and threaten the stability of the world. Then the adherents of the good law can no longer quietly work on humanity, but come out in force, and a fight ensues in which the black magicians are always destroyed, because the good adepts possess not only equal knowledge with the bad ones, but have in addition the great assistance of the general will of nature which is not in control of the others, and so it is inevitable that the good should triumph always. This assistance is also the heritage of every true student, and may be invoked by the real disciple when he has arrived at and passed the first abyss. </font></span></p>

It has become the fashion to some extent to scout careful study or practice and go in for the rapid methods inaugurated in America. In many places emotional goodness is declared to exceed in value the calmness that results from a broad philosophical foundation, and in others astral wonder seeking, or great strength of mind whether discriminative or not, is given the first rank. Strength without knowledge, and sympathetic tears without the ability to be calm&#x2015;in fine, faith without works&#x2015;will not save us. And this is one of the lessons of the second chapter. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The greatest of the ancients inculcated by both symbols and books the absolute necessity for the acquirement of philosophical knowledge, inasmuch as strength or special faculties</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> are useless without it. Those Greeks and others who recorded some of the wisdom of the elder Egyptians well illustrated this. They said, that in the symbols it was shown, as where Hermes is represented as an old and a young man, intending by this to signify that he who rightly inspects sacred matters ought to be both intelligent and strong, one of these without the other being imperfect. And for the same reason the symbol of the great Sphinx was established; the beast signifying strength, and the man wisdom. For strength when destitute of the ruling aid of wisdom, is overcome by stupid astonishment confusing all things together; and for the purpose of action the intellect is useless when it is deprived of strength. So, whether our strength is that of sympathy or of astral vision, we will be confounded if philosophical knowledge be absent. </font> </span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, so as not to be misunderstood, I must answer the question that will be asked, "Do you then condemn sympathy and love, and preach a cold philosophy only?" By no means. Sympathy and emotion are as much parts of the great whole as knowledge, but inquiring students wish to know all that lies in the path. The office of sympathy, charity, and all other</font></span></p>

By this exercise we inevitably attract to us those souls who have the knowledge and are ready to help us to acquire it also. But while we ignore philosophy and do not try to attain to right discrimination, we must pass through many lives, many weary treadmills of life, until at last little by little we have been forced, without our will, into the possession of the proper seeds of mental action from which the crop of right discrimination may be gathered. </font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">ideas held in India regarding sacrifices and ceremonies are known. In the Occident sacrifices have long gone out of use, as there appeared to be no reason for them. And yet it must seem strange to the reflective mind that Christian nations should claim redemption through the Jews whose prophet enjoined sacrifices, and when Jesus himself said that not one jot or tittle of the law should pass away. In the place of the sacrifices of the East, the West has adopted a mere theory to be embraced, together with an uncertain moral code to be followed, with a result which is the same as that claimed by the Hindus&#x2015;save only in one respect. That difference lies in the doctrine of reincarnation. The Christian looks for an eternal reward in heaven and knows nothing of reincarnation on earth, while the Hindu relies upon pleasure to be had in heaven&#x2015;called </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Svarga</font></span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&#x2015;and a continuation of it upon earth by reason of a fortunate rebirth. They have special ceremonies, certain sorts of sacrifices, penances, prayers, and actions, the result of which is a rebirth on earth in a royal family, or with great riches, or in any other sort of pleasant circumstances; and also a sure admittance to heaven. Some ceremonies procure entrance into a delightful state after</font></p>

And his warning is useful to theosophists who are students or wish to become such. With them the false view warned against by Krishna has altered itself into a craving for phenomena, or to perform some action that shall bring them the favor of Mahatmas, or a morbid fear of making karma, or else an equally accentuated desire to acquire good karma. They should abandon those attitudes and carefully study the following verses, trying to incorporate their true meaning into their very being. </font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subject of the three Vedas is the assemblage of the three qualities.

Be not one whose motive for action is the hope of reward. Let not thy life be spent in inaction. Depend upon concentration, perform thy duty, abandon all thought of the consequence, and make the event equal to thee, whether it terminate in good or evil; for such an equanimity is called Yoga (union with God). By far inferior to union with wisdom is action.</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wise men, who have abandoned all thought of the fruit which is produced from their actions, are freed from the chains of birth in this world, and go to the regions of eternal happiness. </font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first portion of this paper was designedly enlarged in order to precede the above.

  <p align="center"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">60</font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">action which our faith shows us must be done, as it were, in evidence; yet action, pure and simple, will not be a cause of liberation, inasmuch as action, or karma, will produce new karma. We must therefore seek for concentration in order that we may be able to do those actions which the All-Wise presents to us to be done, remaining the while unaffected. We have nothing to do with the results; they will come of themselves, and are beyond us; they are already done so far as we are concerned. But if we perform either an act of faith or an action of the body, hoping for any result&#x2015;no matter what&#x2015;we become to that extent attached to the consequences, and thus bound by them. It matters not whether those consequences be good or bad. Many will think that it is well to have attachment to good consequences, since that has been the received opinion. But this is unwise, because the only reason for it is found in the idea that thereby one is somewhat better than some other persons who are enamored of evil results and desire to see them come to pass. This idea produces separateness, and is opposed to that </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">identity </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">without the realization of which there can be no true knowledge.

  <p align="center"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">61</font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">acting as he does in the manifestation of universes, is at the same time free from all consequences. To the extent that we do so we become the Deity himself, for, as we follow the dictates of the Lord who dwells in us, we resign every act upon the altar, leaving the consequences to him. </font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attitude to be assumed, then, is that of doing every act, small and great, trifling or important, because it is before us to do, and as a mere carrying out by us as instruments of the will of that Deity who is ourself. Nor should we stop to inquire whether the act is of any use to the Lord within </font><b><sup><font color="#000080" size="3">(1)</font></sup></b><font size="3">, as some ask. For, they say, of what possible benefit to him can be the small hourly acts which, as soon as done, are forgotten? It is not for us to inquire. The act that pleases that Lord is the act which is done as presented with no attachment to its result, while the act that is unpleasing to him is the one which we do, desiring some result therefrom. </font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krishna says that "the subject of the three Vedas is the assemblage of the three qualities." These three qualities are </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">sattva, rajas,</font></span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3"> and </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">tamas, </font> </span></em><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">and are separately treated in a succeeding chapter.

Yet the remarkable advice is here given, "be thou free from these three qualities." It is a very great wonder that this has not been pounced upon before as showing that Krishna directs his follower to renounce the quality of goodness, and thus directly encourages wickedness, but as that is immediately followed by the direction to "repose upon eternal truth," possible critics have been perhaps deterred by the seeming paradox. It is evident at once that a higher sort of </font><em><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">sattva </font></span></em><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">is referred to in the words "eternal truth." </font><em><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"> <font size="3">Sattva </font></span></em> <font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">is the Sanskrit for truth, and is not qualified when its place among the three qualities is given, so that, when the disciple frees himself from this ordinary </font><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">sattva, </font> </span></em><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">he is to take refuge in its eternal counterpart. Further, the instruction is not to </font><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">renounce </font> </span></em><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">truth or either of the other two qualities, but to remain freed from the influence or binding force that any sort of quality has upon the human ego. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult for a great being such as Krishna to convey to the inquiring mind these high themes, and so, perforce, language must be used that forever has two meanings&#x2015;it continually retreats before us, going from one</font></p> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">64</font></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essence of the instruction given by Krishna</font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3"> is </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">to become devoted, </font></span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">as he says, "Therefore give thyself up to devotion." He prepared the way for that by showing, as adverted to in the last article, how erroneous it was to follow even the special ceremonies and texts laid down for the people in the Vedas. Those ceremonies procured either rewards in heaven, or upon the earth during subsequent lives as well as in those in which the ceremonies were performed. We can more easily understand what Krishna meant if we will suppose him to be referring to a doctrine that in those days was precisely similar in its scheme of rewards to the old-fashioned Christian belief that, by following the Scriptures, one secured happiness and prosperity on earth and great bliss forever in heaven with the saints. This is declared by him to be a deluding doctrine. He does not say that the rewards as laid down will not follow the practice, but implies that they will. But as</font></p> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">65</font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">the wheel of rebirth will eternally revolve, drawing us inevitably back to a mortal body, we are continually deluded and never succeed in attaining to God&#x2015;that being the goal for us all. </font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaven, whether it be that of the Christian or of the Hindu, is what Buddha called a thing or state that has a beginning and will have an end.

Hence Krishna said that men were deluded by those flowery sentences proclaiming a means of reaching heaven, than which there was nothing better. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doubtless there are many students who, believing in the possibility of reaching heaven, say that they are willing to take the risk of what may happen after the enjoyment for such a long period is ended. But those risks would not be taken were they well understood. They are numerous and great. Many of them cannot be stated, because, in order to be understood at all, more must be known of the power of mind and the real meaning of meditation. But the ordinary risks are found in what we</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> may roughly, for the present, call delayed karma and unspent affinities. </font> </span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The power of these two has its root in the vast complexity of man's nature. Such is its complexity that a man cannot, as a complete being, ever enjoy heaven or any state short of union with the divine. Learned theosophists talk of a man's going to devachan, and of his being here on earth suffering or enjoying karma, when as a fact only a small part of him is either here or there. When he has lived out his life and gone to devachan, the vast root of his being stands waiting in the One Life, waiting patiently for him to return and exhaust some more karma. That is, in any one life the ordinary man only takes up and exhausts what karma his bodily apparatus permits. Part of the power of karma is in the "mysterious power of meditation," which exhibits itself according to the particular corporeal body one has assumed. So the man may in this life perform "special ceremonies" and conform to texts and doctrine, attaining thereby the reward of heaven, and still have left over a quantity of that "mysterious power of meditation" unexpended; and what its complexion is he does not know. Its risk therefore is that it may be very bad, and, when he</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">67</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> does return from heaven, his next body may furnish the needed apparatus to bring up to the front this mass of unexpended karma, and his next compensation might be a sojourn in hell. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In reassuming a body, the "mysterious power" spoken of reaches out to numberless affinities engendered in other lives, and takes hold of all that come in its reach. Other beings once known to the man arrive into incarnation at the same time, and bring into action affinities, attractions, and powers that can only act through them and him. Their influence cannot be calculated. It may be good or bad, and, just as he is swayed by them or as his sway the other being, so will work out the karma of each. Krishna</font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3"> therefore advises Arjuna to be free from the influence of the quality, so that he may obtain a </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">complete </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">release. And that freedom can only be attained, as he says, by means of devotion. </font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These effects, divergencies and swaying, are well known to occultists, and, although the idea is very new in the West, it is not unknown in India. This law is both an angel of mercy and a messenger of justice, for, while we have just stated its operation as among the risks,</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">68</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> it is also a means whereby nature saves men often from damnation. </font></span> </p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose in some life long past I had a dear friend, or wife, or relative, with whom my intimacy was interior and deep. Death separates us, and in subsequent lives he devotes himself to truth, to wisdom, to the highest in him, while I go on careless of all but pleasure in the present. After many lives we meet again as either friends or acquaintances. At once the old intimacy asserts itself, and my former friend &#x2015; although maybe neither of us knows it&#x2015;has a strange power to touch my inward life, and wakes me up to search for truth and my own soul. It is the unexpended affinity, and by its aid nature works my salvation. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we should both seek devotion. This devotion is what is inculcated by the Adepts to their chelas. It involves a mental abnegation not agreeable to our modern mind, but that must be acquired or real progress is impossible. We must by means of this mental devotion to the divine, which means abnegation of all the rest, dismiss all results of our actions. It is not ours to say what shall be the result of an action; the Law will bring about a result much better, perhaps, than we had imagined. If the results, if the</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;passing daily circumstances, are not those we expected, then by means of devotion we accept them as just what the Law intended. But if we fix our desire on accomplishing even a seeming good result, we are bound by that desire, no matter whether our wish is accomplished or not. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This exhortation to devotion is at once the most simple and the most difficult. Some deride it because they want powers and "development"; others because they think it too simple; but the wise student, even when he cannot at first grasp its meaning, will revolve it in his mind, strive after it, and make it a thing to be attained by him. </font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> We have seen that devotion must be attained by that student</font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype">&#x2015;</font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> who desires to reach enlightenment. This is what is meant by Krishna's reply to Arjuna, at the conclusion of the second chapter. </font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “When he has put away all desires which enter the heart, and is satisfied by the Self in himself, he is then said to be confirmed in spiritual knowledge. ”</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not possible to be wholly given up to the dictates of the Spirit while any desires that come into the heart are permitted to engross the attention.</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">70</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course the person described here is one who has gone much higher in development than most of us have been able to. But we ought to set up a high ideal at which to aim, for a low one gives a lower result at the expense of the same effort. We should not put before us an aim less than the highest merely because it seems that our success will not be as great as we think it ought to be. It is not so much the clearly perceived outward result that counts, as the motive, effort, and aim, for judgment is not passed upon us among the things of sense where human time exists, but in that larger sphere of being where time ceases, and where we are confronted by what </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">we are </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">and not by what we have done. That which we have done touches us only in mortal life among the delusions of material existence; but the motives with which we live our lives go to make up our greater being, our larger life, our truer self. Do actions we must, for no mortal can live without performing actions; those bring us back to earth for many weary incarnations, perhaps to final failure, unless the lesson is learned that they must be done with the right motive and the true aim. That stage reached, they affect us no more, for, like Krishna, we become the perfect performers</font></p> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">71</font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">of all action. And in so far as we purify and elevate the motive and the aim, we become spiritually enlightened, reaching in time the power to see what should be done and what refrained from. </font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many would-be occultists leave out of sight this chapter's teaching. Devotion has no charms for them; they leave it to those who would be good men, no matter what their creed or philosophy, and attention is paid to reading books, either new or old, upon magic, upon ceremonial, or any other of the manifold delusions. Nor is this erroneous practice newly risen. It was common among the alchemists, and the result in some cases is that students now waste valuable years in mastering ceremonial, Rosicrucianism, talismanic lore, and what not, as laid down in the books, while all of it is either useless mental lumber or positively dangerous. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not mean it to be understood that there never was real Rosicrucianism, or that ceremonial magic yields no results, or that there is no science of talismans. There are realities of which these, as now known, are shadows. But we might as well expect to find the soul by attentively studying the body, as to know the truths behind the influence of talismans or</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> ceremonial magic by studying the books now extant upon those subjects. The mediæval so-called magicians have left a mass of writings that are now a delusion and a snare for students, theosophical and nontheosophical. In these are minute directions for various sorts of practices, but they are all the attempts of men to enable mortals, by methods altogether outward, to control the astral or natural world. Success did not come to these practitioners, nor will much else save failure be the portion of those of our own day who follow their directions. In most cases of the old European so-called sorcerers and writers on magic, their published lucubrations are only salves to disappointed vanity; in the rest, mere reduplications of formulae left by their predecessors. Paracelsus positively declares that true magic is within the man — a part of his inner nature, potential at first, active after development, and that ceremonies or formulae are the veriest rubbish unless the person using them is himself a magician. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">In the practice of ceremonial magic, where certain geometrical and other figures are to be used with the aid of prayers and invocations, there lies positive danger. This danger is increased if the student follows the practice</font></p> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">73</font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">for the sake of gain or glory or power or mere wonder seeking &#x2015;all of these being selfish. In this ceremonial the operator, or self-styled magus, surrounds himself with a circle or an arrangement of triangles, the use and purpose of which are to protect him from whatever sprites he may arouse. Mark that well! It is for </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">protection</font></span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">. Protection of this sort would not be needed or thought of unless a fear lurked inside that the shades or demons had power to hurt. So at the outset, fear, the product of ignorance, is fully present. The next important thing to be noted is that a sword has to enter into the conjuration. This is advised because the demons are said to fear sharp steel. Now Jesus said that he who lived by the sword should perish by the sword. By this he meant just what we are talking about. Ceremonial magic involves at almost every step the use of a sword. After the invocator or magus has used the ceremonial, say with success, for some time, he at last creates within his aura, or what Swedenborg called his sphere, a duplicate of what he had previously used and pictured on the floor or walls. In this he is no longer master, for, it being placed in that part of his nature of which he is ignorant, the sword of metal be-</font></p> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">74</font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">comes an astral sword with the handle held by the demons or influences he unwisely raised. They then attack him where no defense can be interposed&#x2015;on the astral and mental planes, and, just as surely as the wise man's words were uttered, he at last perishes by the weapon he himself used. This danger, thus roughly outlined, is no mere figment of the brain. It is positive, actual, immanent in the practice. No book study will give a man the power to make the constitutional changes, as well as psychical alterations, needed before he is commander of immaterial forces. But these latter may be temporarily evoked and made acquainted with us by pursuing certain methods. That is the beginning. Their turn is sure to come, and, obeying a law of their nature, they take what has sometimes been called their "revenge." For all such practices call only upon the lower, unspiritual part of our nature, and that clothes such beings with corresponding attributes. Their "revenge" consists in bringing on inflammations in the moral character which will eventuate in a development of evil passions, atrophy of concentration, destruction of memory, ending at last in a miserable conclusion to life, and almost total failure to use the opportunities for progress</font></p> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">75</font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">presented by that incarnation. Therefore I said, it is all either useless mental lumber or positively dangerous. </font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In history and in our own experience there is abundant evidence that the <i> Bhagavad-Gita </i>is right in saying "spiritual knowledge includes every action without exception," and that it is to be attained by means of devotion. Ignorant men who had no access to books have by their inward sense perceived the real truth of things, not only those round about them, but relating to the larger concerns of nature. Jacob Boehme was wholly unlettered, but he knew the truth. His writings show an acquaintance, not to be then gained from books, with the true doctrines found in the Hindu scriptures and secret books. In Germany today are men known to me, who, more unlearned yet than Jacob Boehme was, know many things still mysteries for our learned theosophists who can boast of college education. The reason is that these men have attained to devotion, and thereby cleared away from before the eye of the soul the clouds of sense whose shadows obscure our view of truth. I do not decry or despise learning; it is a great possession; but if the learned man were also a devoted one in the sense of the Bhaga-</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning of the human sort is not despised among the highest occultists, even among the adepts. They use it and acquire it. They accumulate </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">the record </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">of the experiences of seers and devoted men of small learning for long periods of time, until a great master of both learning and devotion arises who, by reason of his profound knowledge joined to devotion, can make the wonderful deductions in the possession of the Lodge respecting matters so far beyond us that they can with difficulty be imagined. But this again proves that devotion is the first and best, for these extraordinary Masters would not appear unless devotion had been the aim of their existence. </font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without devotion a vast confusion arises within us that has been likened by some to a whirling motion, by others to the inrushing, overpowering flow of turbid waters. Boehme calls it in some aspects the </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">turba. </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">It is the delusion produced by the senses. And so Krishna, in closing the second lecture, says: </font></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Let a man, restraining all these, remain in devotion when at rest, and intent on me alone; for he whose senses are under his control possesses spiritual knowledge. Attachment to objects of sense arises in a man who meditates upon them; from attachment arises desire; from desire passion springs up; from passion comes bewilderment; from bewilderment, confusion of the memory; from confusion of the memory, destruction of the intellect; from destruction of the intellect he perishes. </font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he who approaches the objects of sense with senses free from love and hate and beneath his own control, having his soul well-disposed, attains to tranquility of thought. In this tranquillity there springs up in him a separation from all troubles. For the mind of him whose thoughts are tranquil soon becomes perfect in concentration. ”</font></span></p>

Then the deities [i.e. the senses] gather around them. And then they undergo death after death.

And the embodied self, in consequence of not understanding union with the real entity, proceeds on all hands with attachment to enjoyments.

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second chapter ends with a declaration of what is the sort of death that results in union with the divine, preventing absolutely any return to incarnations upon earth.

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are the last words of the second chapter. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any other mental attitude at the time of passing away will surely cause us to acquire a mortal body again. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krishna's declaration brings up before us, not only the practices previously inculcated, but also the whole subject of death.

A little reflection shows that what is seen and noted by physicians and spectators is but the withdrawal of the soul and energy from the outer envelope called "body." While that is going on, the person may accept rites of the church or profess adherence to any sort of doctrine whatever, even with his last outward sigh speak of heaven with its bliss awaiting him. But that is only the first step. It leaves his visible features calm and happy, perhaps, in expression; his relatives close his eyes — they call it death. He, however, has only begun to die. The soul has yet to pass through other envelopes beyond the ken of friends, beyond even the dying man's present control. All now depends upon the whole course and kind of thought in which he indulged during the life of the body. For the soul has to pass along the road by which it came, and that way is lined with the memories of a lifetime; as these memories rise up they affect the departing entity, causing it to be either disturbed from concentration on the Supreme Being, or assisting to a greater perfection. If, then, some few years only near the close of life were devoted to the sort of practice inculcated by Krishna, the memories</font></span></p>

It is more perfectly illustrated by considering life as a grand musical movement that is brought to a close by using at once all the tones sounded throughout the whole preceding portion. The result will be a combined sound, expressing neither the highest nor lowest notes, or the sweetest or less sweet, but the resultant of all. And this last sound is the fixed vibration that governs the entity, sounding all through him, and throwing him into the state to which it corresponds or of which it is the key. Thus it is easily seen that in each thought lie the possibilities of a harmony or a discord for life's conclusion. </font></span></p>

Coming down to consider the "created" objects, or the planes on which the thought of God has its expression through its own laws, we find the duality expressed by action and reaction, attraction and repulsion, day and night, outbreathing and inbreathing, and so on.

When Krishna is dwelling on one subject or upon something that has to do with a particular phase of Arjuna's nature, he gives him some name that has reference to the quality, subject, or other matter referred to, and Arjuna changes the name of Krishna</font></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="2"> whenever he has need. As in these first verses, the name used for the Blessed Lord is </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="2">Janardana, </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="2">which means "giver of all that men ask" &#x2015;meaning thereby to refer to Krishna's potency in bringing to fulfillment all wishes. &#x2015;B</font></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krishna then proceeds to tell Arjuna that, it being impossible for one to remain in the world without performing actions, the right practice is to do those actions (duties of life whether in war or peace) which must be done, with a heart unattached to the result, being satisfied to do what is deemed the will of the Lord within, for no other reason than that it ought to be done. He sums it up in the words: </font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “But he who, restraining his senses by his heart, and being free from attachment to the results of action, undertakes active devotion through the organs of action, is worthy of praise. ”</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This he illustrates by referring to those whom he calls "false pietists of bewildered soul," who remain inert with their bodies, restraining the organs of action, while at the same time they ponder on objects of sense which they have merely quitted in form. He thus shows the false position that it is useless to abandon the outer field of action while the mind remains attached to it, for such mental attachment will cause the ego to incarnate again and again upon earth. A little further on in the chapter he refers to a great yogi, one Janaka, who, even while a saint possessed of perfect knowledge which he had obtained</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the outset I confess that these and succeeding verses do not appear easy to explain to Western minds. Although I have had some acquaintance with Occidental reasoning based on Occidental knowledge, it seems hopeless in the present century to elucidate much that is in this chapter. There are numerous points touched on by Krishna for which I find no response in Western thought. Among these are the verses on sacrifice. To say all I think about sacrifice would only expose me to a charge of madness, superstition, or ignorance; it certainly would on every hand be received with incredulity. And while sneers or disbelief have no terrors, it is needless to advert to certain points in the chapter. Yet in passing them by, some sadness is felt that a high civili-</font></span></p>

In Europe individualism is somewhat tempered by various monarchical forms of government which do not by any means cure the evil; and in America, being totally unrestrained and forming in fact the basis of independence here, it has culminated. Its bad effects &#x2015; vaguely as yet shadowing the horizon &#x2015;might have been avoided if the doctrines of the Wisdom-religion had been also believed in by the founders of the republic.

  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not contended by either Brahmins or their followers that food will not be produced except from sacrifice performed according to Vedic ritual, but that </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">right food, </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">productive in the physical organism of the proper conditions enabling man to live up to his highest possibilities, alone is produced in that age<br> </font><font face="Palatino Linotype"> —————————————————————————————————————————————</font><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3"><br> </font><b><sup><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3" color="#000080">(1)</font></sup></b><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"><b><font color="#800000"> </font></b></font><font size="2">In India there are numerous religious observances having in view sanitary effects.

In other places and ages food is produced, but it does not in everything come up to the required standard. In this age we have to submit to these difficulties, and can overcome them by following Krishna's instructions as given in this book. In a verse just quoted the distinction is made between food naturally produced without, and that due to, sacrifice, for he says, "For, being nourished by sacrifices, the gods will give you the </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">desired </font> </span></em><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">food." Carrying out the argument, we find as a conclusion that if the sacrifices which thus nourish the gods are omitted, these "gods" must die or go to other spheres. And as we know that sacrifices are totally disused now, the "gods" spoken of must have long ago left this sphere. It is necessary to ask what and who they are. They are not the mere idols and imaginary beings so constantly mentioned in the indictments brought against India by missionaries, but are certain powers and properties of nature which leave the world when the Kali-yuga or dark age, as this is called, has fully set in. Sacrifices therefore among us would be useless just at present. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is, however, another meaning to the "revolution of the wheel" spoken of by Krish-</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> na. He makes it very clear that he refers to the principle of reciprocity or brotherhood. And this he declares must be kept revolving; that is, each being must live according to that rule, or else he lives a life of sin to no purpose. And we can easily believe that in these days this principle, while admired as a fine theory, is not that which moves the people. They are, on the contrary, spurred by the personal selfish idea of each one becoming better, greater, richer than his neighbor. If continued unchecked it would make this nation one entirely of black magicians. And it was to counteract this that the Theosophical Society was founded, with the object of inducing men to once more revolve this wheel of brotherly love first set in motion by the "creator when of old he had created mortals." </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krishna then proceeds to exhort Arjuna again to perform the duties appointed to him, and urges him to do it on the ground that he being a great man should set a good example that the lower orders would follow; saying, </font></span> </p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “He who understands the whole universe should not cause these people, slow and ignorant of the universe, to relapse from their duty. ”</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such an age as this, the ritualistic sacrifice of a different age which has indeed a magical effect becomes a sacrifice to be performed by each man in his own nature upon the altar of his own heart. And especially is this so with theosophists of sincerity and aspiration. Being born as we are in these days, among families with but small heritage in the wave of descent from unsullied ancestors, we are without the advantage of great natural spiritual leanings, and without certain peculiar powers and tendencies that belong to another cycle. But the very force and rapidity of the age we live in give us the power to do more now in fewer incarnations. Let us then recognize this, and learn what is our duty and do it. This portion of the chapter ends with a famous verse: </font> </span></p>

He sees in this the operation of an unknown force that molds men in a manner that they would not allow if conscious of it, and he says: </font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are at first inclined to suppose that the field of action of this quality is the senses alone; but Krishna teaches that its empire reaches beyond those and includes the heart and the intellect also.

  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">siring knowledge and freedom finds itself snared continually by </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">tamas, </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">which, ruling also in the heart and mind, is able to taint knowledge and thus bewilder the struggler. </font></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the senses particularly, this force has sway. And the senses include all the psychical powers so much desired by those who study occultism. It does not at all follow that a man is spiritual or knows truth because he is able to see through vast distances, to perceive the denizens of the astral world, or to hear with the inner car. In this part of the human economy the dark quality is peculiarly powerful. Error is more likely to be present there than elsewhere, and unless the seer is self governed he gets no valuable knowledge, but is quite likely to fall at last, not only into far more grievous error, but into great wickedness. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must therefore begin, as advised by Krishna, with that which is nearest to us, that is, with our senses. We cannot slay the foe there at first, because it is resident also in the heart and mind. By proceeding from the near to the more remote, we go forward with regularity and with certainty of conquest at last. Therefore he said, "In the first place, restrain thy senses." If we neglect those and devote</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> ourselves wholly to the mind and heart, we really gain nothing, for the foe still remains undisturbed in the senses. By means of those, when we have devoted much time and care to the heart and mind, it may throw such obscurations and difficulties in the way that all the work done with the heart and mind is rendered useless. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is by means of the outward senses and their inner counterparts that a great turmoil is set up in the whole system, which spreads to the heart and from there to the mind, and, as it is elsewhere said: "The restless heart then snatches away the mind from its steady place." </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We thus have to carry on the cultivation of the soul by regular stages, never neglecting one part at the expense of another. Krishna advises his friend to restrain the senses, and then to "strengthen himself by himself." The meaning here is that he is to rely upon the One Consciousness which, as differentiated in a man, is his higher self. By means of this higher self he is to strengthen the lower, or that which he is accustomed to call "myself." </font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exoteric authorities agree that Vivasvat is a name for the sun; that after him came Manu, and his son was Ikshvaku. The latter founded the line of Solar Kings, who in early times in India were men of supreme knowledge. They were adepts every one, and ruled the land as only adepts could, for the darker ages had not come on, and such great Beings could naturally live among men. Everyone respected them, and there was no rebellion even in thought, since there could be no occasion for complaint. Although Vivasvat as a name for the sun reveals nothing to our Western ears, there is a great truth hidden behind it, just as today there is as great a mystery behind our solar orb. He was the Being appointed to help and guide the race at its beginning. He had himself, ages before, gone through incarnation during other creations, and had mounted step by step up the long ladder of evolution, until by natural right he had become as a god. The same process is going on today, preparing some Being for similar work in ages to come. And it has gone on in the limitless past also; and always the Supreme Spirit as Krishna</font></span></p>

This succession lasts until the age no longer will permit, and then all things grow confused spiritually, material progress increases, and the dark age, fully come, ushers in the time before dissolution. Such is the present time. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to the period marked by the first earthly king called Ikshvaku, the ruler was a spiritual Being whom all men knew to be such, for his power, glory, benevolence, and wisdom were evident. He lived an immense number of years, and taught men not only yoga but also arts and sciences. The ideas implanted then, having been set in motion by one who knew all the laws, remain as </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">inherent ideas </font></span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">to this day.

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fables in every nation and race about great personages, heroes, magicians, gods, who dwelt among them in the beginning, living long lives, are due to the causes I have outlined. And in spite of all the sneers and labored efforts of scientific scoffers to show that there is no soul, and perhaps no hereafter, the innate belief in the Supreme, in heaven, hell, magic, and what not, will remain. They are preserved by the uneducated masses, who, having no scholastic theories to divert their minds, keep up what is left of the succession of ideas. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arjuna is surprised to hear one whose birth he knew of declaring that Vivaswat was his contemporary, and so asks Krishna how that can happen.

As in the poem Arjuna is also called </font></span><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Nara, </font></span> </em><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">which means <i> Man</i>, we here have an ancient postulation of reincarna-</font></span></p>

Then very naturally he opens the doctrine, well known in India, of the reappearances of Avatars. There is some little dispute among the Hindus as to what an Avatar is; that is, whether he is the Supreme Spirit itself or only a man overshadowed by the Supreme to a greater extent than other men. But all admit that the true doctrine is stated by Krishna in the words: </font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These appearances among men for the purpose of restoring the equilibrium are not the same as the rule of Vivaswata and Manu first spoken of, but are the coming to earth of Avatars or Saviors. That there is a periodicity to them is stated in the words "from age to age." He is here speaking of the great cycles about which hitherto the Masters have been silent except to say that there are such great cycles. It is very generally admitted now that the cyclic law is of the highest importance in</font></span></p>

So we find in the history of India that, when Krishna appeared so long ago, there was also a great tyrant, a black magician named Kansa, whose wickedness equaled the goodness of Krishna. And to such a possibility the poem refers, where it says that Krishna comes when wickedness has reached a maximum development. The real meaning of this is that the bad karma of the world goes on increasing with the lapse of the ages, producing at last a creature who is, so to say, the very flower of all the wickedness of the past, counting from the last preceding Avatar. He is not only wicked, but also wise, with magic powers of awful scope, for magic is not alone the heritage of the good. The number of magicians developed among the nations at such a time is very great, but one towers above them all, making the rest pay tribute. It is not a fairy tale but a sober truth, and the present prevalence of self-</font></span></p>

With these he is able to engage in conflict with the black magicians, and in it is assisted by all of us who are really devoted to brotherhood. The result is a victory for the good and destruction for the wicked.

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It springs from ignorance, and all we have to do is to take the sword of knowledge and cut all doubts at once.” Many will say that they have been always looking for this that they may have peace, and that so many systems are presented for their consideration they are unable to come to any conclusion whatever. This would seem very true on a view of the thousand and one philosophies placed before us with varying degrees of clearness by the exponents of them. But it has appeared to us that they can all be easily sifted and divided into classes where they will range themselves under two great heads</font></span><span style="font-family: Arial"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&#x2015;</font></span><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">those which permit nothing to be believed until the miserable mass of mediocre minds have said that they at last accept this or that, and those which have each a little of what may possibly be true and a great deal that is undeniable nonsense. The doubter is a devotee of the first school, or he is an adherent partly of one and partly of the other; and in the latter case is torn almost asunder by the numberless conventional ideas which bear the stamp of author-</font></span></p>

If you tell him that the much-lauded mind is not the final judge, and that there are higher faculties which may be exercised for the acquirement of knowledge, he disputes on the lines laid down by learned professors of one school or another, and denies the validity of proofs offered on the ground that they are instances of "double cerebration," and what not. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To such as these the chapter will not appeal, but there are many students who have sincere doubts, and with those the difficulty arises from ignorance. They are afraid to admit to themselves that the ancients could have found out the truth; and the reason would appear to be that this judgment is passed from a consideration of the merely material state of those people or of the present nations who in any degree follow such philosophies. Our civilization glorifies material possessions and progress, and those who have not these boons cannot be the possessors of either truth or the way to it. But the keepers of truth have never said that we will be neither rich nor civilized if we follow their system. On the contrary, in the days when Krishna lived and taught his system there was more material</font></span></p>

Hence if anyone teaches that the reign of the doctrines of the Masters will be the knell of all material comfort and progress, he errs, and sows the seeds of trouble for himself and his friends. Why, then, is it not wise to at once admit that there may be truth in these doctrines, throw away all doubt, and enjoy the light coming from the East? </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So long as doubt remains there will be no peace, no certainty, nor any hope of finding it in this world or the lives upon it hereafter, and not even in the vast reaches of other universes on which we may live in future ages; the doubter now will be the doubter then, and so on while the wheel revolves for the millions of years yet before us. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we follow the advice of the great Prince, our next step will be to assume, in view of patent facts of evolution, that certain great Beings exist who long ago must have trod the same road, and now possess the knowledge with the power to impart as much as we are able to take. To this Krishna refers in these words: </font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And such are the exact words of the Masters. They do not reward or teach merely because we so wish it to be, nor because we value ourselves at so much; our valuation of ourselves is not theirs. They value us at the real and just rate, and cannot be moved by tears or entreaties not followed by acts, and the acts that delight them are those performed in their service, and no others. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> What, then, is the work in which they wish to be served? </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not the cultivation of our psychic powers, nor the ability to make phenomena, nor any kind of work for self when that is the sole motive. </font> </span></p>

  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of this chapter in Sanskrit is “Karmasanyasayog,” which means "The Book of Religion by Renouncing Fruit of Works."

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arjuna is supposed to bring forward the objections raised by, or views belonging to, the two great Indian schools called the Sankhya and the Yoga, one of which advised its votaries to renounce all works and to do nothing whatever, while the other called for the performance of works. The divergent views naturally caused great differences in practice, for the followers of one would be found continually working, and those of the other continually doing nothing. Hence we find, in India, even at the present day, great numbers of ascetics who remain inert, and encounter on the other hand those who go on making karma with a view to salvation.</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very little reflection will show the student that the only result of action, as such, will be a continuation of action, and hence that no amount of mere works will in themselves confer nirvana or rest from karma. The only direct product of karma is karma. And this difficulty rose before Arjuna in the fifth conversation. He says: </font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou praisest, Krishna, the renunciation of works; on the other hand, devotion through them.

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meaning of the teacher has been by some suggested to be that, inasmuch as the life of the ascetic is very hard, almost impossible for the majority of men, it is wiser to now perform good acts in the hope that they will lead one hereafter to a favorable birth in such sur-</font></span></p>

I think such is not the meaning, but that, on the contrary, the seemingly easy alternative of performing actions properly is in reality the most difficult of all tasks. And no matter how much we may wait for a favorable birth, for a much hoped-for environment which will not only permit the new sort of life but, in fact, urge it upon us, it will never arrive for us until we have learned what is the right performance of action. This learning can never be acquired by a renunciation of works now. Indeed, it may be taken for granted that no person will be able to renounce the world unless he has passed through the other experience in some life. A few may be found who attempt to do so, but if they have not been through all action they cannot proceed. The character of the man himself inwardly is the real test. No matter how many times during countless births he has renounced the world, if his inner nature has not renounced, he will be the same man during the entire period, and whenever, in any one of his ascetic lives, the new, the appro-</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Yet such abstraction, Chief! <br> </font><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Is hard to win without much holiness. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krishna praises both schools, telling Arjuna that the disciples of each will arrive at a like end; but he says that right performance of action is the better. Now we must reconcile these two. If one is better than the other and yet both conduct to the same goal, there must be some reason for making the comparison, or hopeless confusion results. Acting upon his apparent equal endorsement, many seekers have abandoned action, thereby hoping to gain salvation. They ignored the sixth verse, which reads: </font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “O thou of mighty arms, it is difficult to attain true renunciation, </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">without right performance of action;</font></span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3"> the devotee </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">rightly performing action attains to true renunciation</font></span></em><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3"> before long. ”</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here again is a higher place assigned to performance of action. It seems clear that what Krishna meant was that renunciation</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> of action in any one life, followed by the same conduct in all the subsequent lives thereby affected, would at last lead the renouncer to see how he must begin to stop that kind of renunciation and take up the performance of actions while he renounced the fruit of them. This is thought by many occultists to be the true view. It is well known that the ego returning to regeneration is affected by the actions of his previous births, not only circumstantially in the various vicissitudes of a life, but also in the tendency of the nature to any particular sort of religious practice, and this effect operates for a length of time or number of births exactly commensurate with the intensity of the previous practice. And naturally in the case of one who deliberately renounced all in the world, devoting himself to asceticism for many years, the effect would be felt for many lives and long after other temporary impressions had worn off. In going on thus for so many births, the man at last acquires that clearness of inner sight which brings him to perceive what method he really ought to follow. Besides also the natural development, he will be assisted by those minds whom he is sure to encounter, who have passed through all the needed experience.

One may donate millions in alms, and yet not thereby benefit his real character in the least. It is very true that he will reap material rewards, perhaps in some other life, but those even will be of no benefit, since he will be still the same.

This aspiration is commendable above most that we can formulate, but when we coldly ask ourselves soon after that aspiration has been formed, "Why am I thus aspiring; why do I want to be near in sense to the Master?", we</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> are obliged to admit that the impelling motive for acquiring the aspiration was tinged with selfishness. We can easily prove this by inquiring in the forum of our own conscience if we had the aspiration for ourself or for the great mass of men, rich and poor, despicable and noble; would we be able to feel content were we suddenly told that our deep longing had given the boon to others and that we must wait ten lives more? It is safe to say that the answer would be that we were very sorry. In the twelfth verse we find the remedy for the difficulty, as well as the difficulty itself, clearly stated thus: </font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The right performer of action, abandoning fruit of action, attains to rest through devotion; the wrong performer of action, attached to fruit thereof on account of desire, remains bound. ”</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These instructions will be very difficult for all who are living for themselves and who have not in some small degree begun to believe that they are not here for their own sake. But when we feel that there is no separation between us and any other creature, and that our higher self is leading us through all the experiences of life to the end that we shall recognize the unity of all, then, instead of continually acting contrary to that object of the Higher Self, we</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> try to acquire the right belief and aspiration. Nor need we be deterred, as some are, by the extreme difficulty of eliminating the selfish desire for progress. That will be the task during many lives, and we should begin it voluntarily as soon as it is known, instead of waiting for it to be forced in upon us through suffering and many defeats. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A common mistake made by students is corrected in this chapter. It is the habit of many to say that, if these doctrines are followed to the letter, the result is a being who cares for nothing but the calmness which comes from extinction in the Supreme Spirit&#x2015;that is, the extreme of selfishness. And popular writers contribute to this ridiculous impression, as we can see in the numerous articles on the subject. Among those writers it is the sequence of the "personal aggrandizement idea," which is the bane of the present age, as occultists think, but the chief beauty of it in the eyes of those to whom we refer. Krishna puts it clearly enough in the twenty-fifth verse: </font></span> </p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Effacement in the Supreme Spirit is gained by the right-seeing sage whose sins are exhausted, who hath cut asunder all doubts, whose senses and organs are under control,</font></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the last qualification is absent, then he is not a “right-seeing sage” and cannot reach union with the Supreme. It must follow that the humblest imitator, everyone who desires to come to that condition, must try to the best of his ability to imitate the sage who has succeeded. And such is the word of the Master; for he says in many places that, if we expect to have his help, we must apply ourselves to the work of helping humanity &#x2015;to the extent of our ability. No more than this is demanded. </font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Renunciation, equal-mindedness, true meditation, the golden mean in action, the unity of all things, the nature of rebirth and the effect of devotion upon it and devachan, are all touched upon. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a most practical chapter which would benefit students immensely if fully grasped and followed. The mistakes made many thousand years ago by disciples were the same as those of today. Today, just as then, there are those who think true renunciation consists in doing nothing except for themselves, in retiring from active duties, and in devoting their attention to what they are pleased to call self-development. On the other hand are those who mistake incessant action for true devotion. The true path is between these two. </font> </span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The forsaking of worldly action&#x2015; called </font><span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">sannyas</font></span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&#x2015;is the same as what is known in </font> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Europe as the monastic life, especially in some</font></span></p>

It is merely an attempt to save oneself.

  <p align="justify"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be a true renouncer of action and a devotee one must put the problem on another plane. On the physical brain plane there is no way of reconciling a contradiction such as appears to exist in the direction to perform actions and yet renounce their performance. It is exactly here that many readers of the </font> <span style="font-family: Arial"><em> <span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">Bhagavad-Gita </font> </span></em></span><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">stop and are confused. They have for so long been accustomed to thinking of the physical and living in it, the terms used for their thought are so material in their application, that, seeing this contradiction, they say that the book will not benefit them. But considering the difficulty from the view that the real actor is the mind, that acts are not the dead outward expressions of them, but are the thoughts themselves, we can see how one can be both a renouncer and a devotee, how we can outwardly perform every action, multitudes of them, being as active as anyone who is</font></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duty and the final imperative&#x2015;the “what ought I to do”&#x2015; comes in here and becomes a part of the process. The actions to be performed are not any and every one. We are not to go on heedlessly and indiscriminately doing everything that is suggested. We must discover what actions ought to be performed by us and do them for that reason and not because of some result we expect to follow. The fact that we may be perfectly certain of the result is no reason for allowing our interest to fasten upon that. Here again is where certain theosophists think they have a great difficulty. They say that knowing the result one is sure to become interested in it. But this is the very task to be essayed — to so hold one's mind and desires as not to be attached to the result. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By pursuing this practice true meditation is begun and will soon become permanent.

All those things are merely forms which in the end will do no lasting good. But many students have run after these follies, ignoring the true way. The truth is that the right method is not easy; it requires thought and mental effort, with persistency and faith. Staring at spots and such miscalled occult practices are very easy in comparison with the former. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we are human and weak. As such we require help, for the outer self cannot succeed in the battle. So Krishna points out that the lower self is to be raised up by the help of the higher; that the lower is, as it were, the enemy of the higher, and we must not allow the worse to prevail. It will all depend upon self-mastery. The self below will continually drag down the man who is not self-conquered. This is because that lower one is so near the thick darkness that hangs about the lower rungs of evolution's ladder it is partly devil. Like a heavy weight it will drag into the depths the one who does not try to conquer himself. But on its other side the self is near to divinity, and when conquered it becomes the friend and helper of the conqueror.

We cannot reach to this easily, perhaps not in many lives, but we can try. Every effort we make in that direction will be preserved in the inner nature and cannot be lost at death. It is a spiritual gain, the riches laid up in heaven to which Jesus referred. To describe the perfection of equal-mindedness is to picture an adept of the highest degree, one who has passed beyond all worldly considerations and lives on higher planes. Gold and stones are the same to him. The objects he seeks to accomplish are not to be reached through gold, and so it and the pebbles have the same value. He is also so calm and free from delusion of mind and soul that he remains the same whether with enemies or friends, with the righteous or the sinners. </font></p>

They set up the ideal, but in a too material and human manner. Then they thought to walk on the chosen path by outward observance, by pretending to regard gold and stones as the same to them, while in their hearts they preferred the gold. Their equal-mindedness they confined to other people's affairs, while they displeased and alarmed all relatives and friends by the manner of riding this hobby and by wrong neglect of obvious duty. Truly they sought for equal-mindedness, but failed to see that it can only be acquired through right performance of duty, and not by selecting the duties and environments that please us. </font></span> </p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This chapter is devoted to the question of that spiritual discernment by means of which the Supreme Spirit can be discerned in all things, and the absence of which causes a delusion constantly recurring, the producer of sorrow. Krishna says that this sort of knowledge leaves nothing else to be known, but that to attain it the heart&#x2015;that is, every part of the nature&#x2015;must be fixed on the Spirit, meditation has to be constant, and the Spirit made the refuge or abiding-place. He then goes on to show that to have attained to such a height is to be a mahatma. </font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> One which can be known. This is not the nature of man, and does not oppose the theosophical sevenfold system of human principles. No particular theosophical classification for the divisions of nature has been given out. It would, on the one hand, not be understood, and on the other, disputes leading to no good end would follow. He might as well have stated the twenty-fivefold division held by some other school. This “inferior nature” is only so relatively. It is the phenomenal and transient which disappears into the superior at the end of a kalpa. It is that part of God, or of the Self, which chose to assume the phenomenal and transient position, but is, in essence, as great as the superior nature. The inferiority is only relative. As soon as objective material, and subjective spiritual, worlds appear, the first-named has to be denominated inferior to the other, because the spiritual, being the permanent base, is in that sense superior; but as an absolute whole all is equal. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Included in the inferior nature are all the visible, tangible, invisible and intangible worlds; it is what we call nature. The invisible and intangible are nonetheless actual; we know that poisonous gas, though invisible and intangible, is fatally actual and potential.</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> 134</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experiment and induction will confer a great deal of knowledge about the inferior nature of God and along that path the science of the modern West is treading, but before knowing the occult, hidden, intangible realms and forces&#x2015;often called spiritual, but not so in fact&#x2015;the inner astral senses and powers have to be developed and used. This development is not to be forced, as one would construct a machine for performing some operation, but will come in its own time as all our senses and powers have come. It is true that a good many are trying to force the process, but at last they will discover that human evolution is universal and not particular; one man cannot go very far beyond his race before the time. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krishna points out to Arjuna a gulf between the inferior and the superior. This latter is the Knower and that which sustains the whole universe, and from it the inferior nature springs. So the materialistic and scientific investigator, the mere alchemist, the man who dives into the occult moved by the desire for gain to himself, will none of them be able to cross the gulf at all, because they do not admit the indwelling Spirit, the Knower. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The superior nature can be known because</font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> it is in fact the Knower who resides in every human being who has not degraded himself utterly. But this must be admitted before any approach to the light can be made. And but few are really willing, and many are unable, to admit the universal character of the Self. They sometimes think they do so by admitting the Self as present, as contiguous, as perhaps part tenant. This is not the admission, it leaves them still separate from the Self. All the phenomenal appearances, all the different names, and lives, and innumerable beings, are hung suspended, so to say, on the Self. Thus: </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all things hang on me as precious gems upon a string. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of pre-eminently great and precious things and powers are here enumerated and declared to be the Self; while next the very delusions and imperfections of life and man are included. Nothing is left out. This is certainly better than an illogical religion which separates God from the delusions and cruelties of nature, and then invents a third thing, in the person of a devil, who is the source of human wickedness. All this further accentuates the difficulties in the way. Krishna says the illusion is difficult to surmount,</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> 136</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> but that success can be attained by taking refuge in the Self &#x2015;for he is the Self. The entire congregation of worshipers who are righteous find favor with the Self, but those who are spiritually wise are on the path that leads to the highest, which is the Self. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means, as Krishna says, that those who with the eye of spiritual wisdom see that the Self is all, begin to reincarnate with that belief ingrained in them. Hitherto they had come back to earth without that single idea, but possessed of many desires and of ideas which separated them from the Self. Now they begin to return fully at rest in the Self and working out their long-accumulated karma. And at last they become what was mentioned in the opening verses, a mahatma or great soul. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is, however, a large number of persons who are in the class which has been deprived of spiritual discernment “through diversity of desires” or who have not yet had discernment for the same reason. The verse reads as follows: </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who through diversity of desires are deprived of spiritual wisdom adopt particular rites subordinated to their own natures, and worship other Gods. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> 137</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although these words, like the rest of the colloquy, were spoken in India and to a Hindu, they are thoroughly applicable in the West. Every mode of thought and of living may be called a rite gone over by each one as his conscious or unconscious religion. A man adopts that which is conformable, or subordinate, to his own nature, and being full of desires he worships or follows other gods than the Supreme Self. In India the words would more particularly mean the worship, which is quite common, of idols among those who are not educated out of idolatry; but they would also mean what is said above. In the West these "other gods" are the various pleasures, objects, aims and modes of life and thought, be they religious or not, which the people adopt. They have not the many thousands of gods of the Hindu pantheon, each one for some particular purpose, but it comes to the same thing. The idol-worshiper bows to the god visible so that he may attain the object of his heart which that god is supposed to control. The Western man worships his object and strives after it with all his heart and mind and thus worships something else than the Supreme Imperishable One. The god of one is political advancement, of another&#x2015;and</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> 138</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> generally of most&#x2015;the possession of great wealth. One great god is that of social advancement, the most foolish, hollow and unsatisfactory of all; and with it in America is yoked the god of money, for without wealth there is no social preeminence possible except in those cases where official position confers a temporary glory. The mother often spends sleepless nights inventing means for pushing her daughter into social success; the father lies wakefully calculating new problems for the production of money. The inheritors of riches bask in the radiance coming from their own gold, while they strive for new ways to make, if possible, another upward step on that road, founded on ashes and ending at the grave, which is called social greatness. And out of all this striving many and various desires spring up so that their multiplicity and diversity completely hide and obstruct all spiritual development and discernment. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But many who are not so carried away by these follies attend to some religion which they have adopted or been educated into. In very few cases, however, is the religion adopted: it is born with the child; it is found with the family and is regularly fastened on as a gar-</font></span></p> 
  <p align="left"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">139</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> ment. If in this religion, or cult, there is faith, then the Supreme Self, impartial and charitable, makes the faith strong and constant so that thereby objects are attained. In whatever way the devotee chooses to worship with faith it is the Supreme which, though ignored, brings about the results of faith. </font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A curious speculation rises here; it may be true, it may be not. It can be noticed that millions of prayers are recited every month addressed to the One God, all through Christendom, asking various favors. Millions were offered for the conversion to a better life of the Prince of Wales&#x2015;they failed. The rain ceases and prayers are made, but the dryness continues. Candles are lighted and prayers said to stop the earthquake which is destroying the city&#x2015;the quakings go on until the impulse is ended and the city ruined. It is perfectly impossible to prove answers to prayer in enough cases to convince the thoughtful. Now the speculative thought is that perhaps the prayers offered to an unmanifested God have no effect, for to be effectual the Being appealed to must have a separate existence so as to be able to intervene in separated manifested things. Christians do not possess the statistics of results from prayer offered to</font></span></p> 
  <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> 140</font></span></p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> Gods in Oriental countries. The usual cases brought forward in the West are such as the orphan asylum, for which nothing is asked except in prayer. But in India they have institutions similarly&#x2015;but not so lavishly&#x2015;supported and no asking alone save to the particular patron god. It is a matter of strong, constant faith which carries the thoughts of the prayer into the receptive minds of other people, who are then moved by the subconscious injected thought to answer the request. Now if the prayer is offered to an unseen and unknown God the faith of the person is not firm, whereas perhaps in the case of the idol-worshiper or of the Roman Catholic addressing himself to the Mother of God with her image before him, the very presence of the representative is an aid to constancy in faith. All this applies of course to prayers for personal and selfish ends. But that prayer or aspiration which is for spiritual light and wisdom is the highest of all, no matter to whom or what addressed. All religions teach that sort of prayer; all others are selfish and spiritually useless. </font></span></p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3">Although the strength of the devotee's devotion and faith for any God or object is due entirely to the Supreme Self, no matter if the faith be foolish and the God false, yet the reward obtained is said to be temporary, transitory, sure to come to an end. But unlike Western religious systems this is declared to be a matter of law instead of being determined by sentiment or arbitrarily. The sentences in which I find this are as follows: </font></span> </p> 
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the reward of such short-sighted men is temporary. Those who worship the Gods go to the Gods, and those who worship me come unto me. </font></span></p>

If the object be anything that is distinct from the Supreme Self then the mind is at once turned into that, becomes that, is tinted like that. This is one of the natural capacities of the mind. It is naturally clear and uncolored, as we would see if we were able to find one that had not gone through too many experiences.

Their efforts at all times have been directed towards aiding the advancing intelligence of mankind to a truer realization of the essential nature of all beings, from which alone can come perfection in knowledge and hence the highest happiness.</font></span></p>

Another expression for the same idea is “ The Self of all creatures”, and in the present chapter Krishna begins his reply to Arjuna by saying “Braman the Supreme is the exhaustless”. These terms, and many others used, are but different ways of conveying the same idea.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As has been before stated, Krishna stands for the Higher Self of all beings; there fore all the discourses under his name are to be taken as addressed to all men and not merely as from one personage to another. It will then be understood that when He speaks of “my being manifesting as the Individual Self ”, “Purusha, the Spiritual Person” or “myself in this body”, He refers to the constituents of each human being.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Karma is the emanation which causes the existence and reproduction of creatures”. Perhaps this sentence may be made more clear if the student takes into consideration the ancient aphorism that “There is no Karma unless there is a being to make it or feel its effects”; Karma means action, and as each being or creature acts according to his own degree of perception and feels the re-action or effect in the same relation, Karma as a whole, in so far as any world or system of worlds is concerned, is the interaction of all the beings</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krishna shows that the realization of immortality must be had during life in the body if the highest state is to be attained. This state reached, the necessity for reincarnation ceases. Those however whose beliefs are strongly fixed on some particular form of after death existence, have a realization of what they aspire to and then in the fulness of time are reborn upon earth.</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the dialogue Krishna speaks of the various paths of devotion taken by men. Most of these paths are taken in order to obtain some coveted reward, such as freedom from rebirth, enjoyment of the individual’s ideal of happiness after release from the body; individual salvation. He shows that all these rewards may be obtained by constant effort, but that all are temporary in duration, necessitating a return to earthly existence at some later period, however remote. “The Brahmacharya laboring for salvation”, labors for himself alone; he “goeth to the supreme goal”, but in that state is beyond the power of helping his fellow men. Although he may remain in that blissful state for an immense period of time, the duties to his fellow men which set aside in order to obtain salvation for himself, will inevitably place him where those duties have to be faced and fulfilled. The case of such an one is quite different from “those great-souled ones who have attained to supreme perfection” in knowledge and universal duty.</font></span></p>

This more fully explained in the Secret Doctrine by H. P. Blavatsky, Vol. I, in that part referring to the Three Fundamental Principles. Briefly stated, our present earthly existence is the result of previous ones; the present earth is the result of previous earths; the present solar system is the result of previous ones. All of these present progress of some sort, for the essence of progress is change. All beings have evolved to their present status, be that high or low, and all are still evolving; an infinite universe presents infinite possibilities. “But,” says Krishna, “there is that which upon the dissolution of all things else is not destroyed; it is indivisible, indestructible, and of another nature from the visible”. This is the Divine Spark of Spirit, Life, and Consciousness in every form and being. In Man it is called the “Perceiver”, That which sees, learns and knows, apart from all objects, circumstances or conditions through which It passes. “This Supreme, 0 son of Pritha, within whom all creatures are included, and by whom all this is pervaded, may be attained by a devotion which is intent on him alone”. To “act for and as</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I will now declare to thee, 0 best of the Bharatas, at what time yogis dying obtain freedom from or subjection to rebirth”. Yogis are those who strive for union with the Higher Self. All do not succeed in any one life, so some are subject to rebirth. Krishna indicates the conditions of planets and seasons in the several cases of departure. It would appear from the specific statement above quoted that the indications mentioned do not apply to those whose thoughts are based upon material existence, and that in such cases other indications apply. It may be of interest to consider in this relation the declaration of the ancient sages that all Souls do not depart from the body in the same way. They hold that there are seven great plexi governing other minor ones, these represent channels through which influences are received or given. Each of these channels has its own direct relation to one of the seven divisions of the system, thus showing Man to have the possibility of conscious relation with all the divisions. From this it would follow that the predominating</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">idea of any one life would necessitate departure through some particular channel leading to its own appropriate realm of freedom or bondage. Thus Man binds himself or frees himself by reason of his spiritual power—and his connection with every department and division of great Nature. Krishna concludes the chapter by saying, “The man of meditation who knoweth all this, reaches beyond what ever rewards are promised in the Vedas, or that result from sacrifices, or austerities, or from gifts of charity, and goeth to the supreme, the highest place”. This highest place is sometimes called “All-knowingness,” the perfection of knowledge, the possession of which confers power of action upon any or all departments of manifested Nature. To reach this “highest place” the highest motive must prevail in all thought and action, perhaps through many lives. The idea of this highest motive may be best conveyed by considering the following ancient pledge :—</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That any book or system of thought should purport to afford the means by which such universal knowledge may be gained, is a fact which demands the attention of every intelligent mind. A claim so great may not be lightly brushed aside as unworthy of deep consideration. Thinkers everywhere admit that what is needed in the world is a self evidently true basis for thought and action; they realize that our sciences, philosophies and religions are attempts, more or less sincere, to obtain such a basis, but are being continually confronted with the fact that none of these supply a sure foundation for the peace, happiness and true progress of mankind. It is realized, for instance, that our modern modes of thought are based upon and applied to ma-</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is interesting to note that the modern basis of thought and action is the reverse of that of the ancient sages, and that whereas our ways of thinking leave us in the dark, the ways of the ancients throw a clear light upon all our problems. Let us therefore study the wisdom of the past, that we may go forward with a clearer and more definite purpose than we now have.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this chapter, Krishna addresses his disciple Arjuna in these terms: “Unto thee who findeth no fault, I will now make known this most mysterious knowledge, coupled with a realization of it, which having known thou shalt be delivered from evil.” The words “Unto thee who findeth no fault” mean that Arjuna is recognized as one who understands that Law rules in everything and every circumstance, and that nothing can come to him of good or of evil, but that of which he him self was the cause; thus he accepted the good</font></span></p>

Thus at the outset Krishna propounds and Arjuna accepts the rule of Law, as a necessary step towards further enlightenment.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term “knowledge” as used here has a greater meaning than we are accustomed to give it; for we would esteem as “knowledge” an all-round acquaintance with religions, philosophies, arts, sciences and histories as so far recorded, together with that which our senses give us in regard to the external material world. It is generally held, for instance, that one cannot know the constituents or properties of a piece of stone, without mechanical or chemical aids applied directly to the object, and that nothing can be known of the thoughts or feelings of another unless expressed in words or acts; whereas, the knowledge spoken of by Krishna implies a full identification of the mind—or thinking power—, with whatever subject or object it may be directed to, which concentration enables the perceiver to cognize all the inherent qualities of the subject or</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The possibility of such “all-knowingness” is not admitted by the leaders of thought, and men of our day, whose process is based upon reasoning from particulars to universals, from effects to probable cause, and who are content to erect ever-changing hypotheses. Their process of reasoning is one, which although more refined and expanded, is the same as that used by our savage races. The sages of old, through experience gained from many civilizations, had learned to begin with universals—the plane of causation—and had finally come to see, understand and use the true process, after numberless testings and verifications. It is the result of this acquired wisdom that Krishna imparts to Arjuna as rapidly as his advancing intelligence will permit. It is this wisdom and its results that are portrayed in the Secret Doctrine—or Theosophy. So, if the student is to understand the Bhagavad-Gita, he must begin with universals and with the universal ever in mind expand into all particulars.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the opening sentence of the second paragraph of this chapter. “All this universe is pervaded by me in my invisible form; all things exist in me, but I do not exist in them”;</font></span></p>

So the above sentence may be read “All this universe is pervaded and sustained by the One Self—the Omnipresent Spirit; as it is the Self and Perceiver in all forms, it cannot be seen externally. Because of It, all forms exist; but It is not dependent upon form or forms; these are dependent upon It.” In this sentence is contained an expression of the basic Universal Principle, the cause and sustainer of all that was, is, or ever shall be, and without which nothing exists. Being Universal or Omnipresent, and Infinite, no form of thought can define It; yet mankind has ever attempted to define the Infinite by their finite conceptions of Deity. Hence the many gods of different times and peoples; man-made idols every one of them, whether they be mental or physical. It is these man-made conceptions of Deity that have ever tended to erect and sustain divisions between peoples; tribal .and national</font></span></p>

A kalpa means a great age or period, and the law referred to is what is spoken of in the Secret Doctrine as the Law of Periodicity, or the law of cycles. Everywhere in nature we find this law in operation, as in day and night, summer and winter, life and ,death, in-breathing and out-breathing, the systole and diastole of the heart, sowing and reaping.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phrase “I cause them to evolve again” carries with it the meaning that each period of manifestation, great or small, is followed by another on the basis of the experience gained. That which causes “them to evolve again” is the Self of All, which is also the self of each, or as it has been poetically called, “the Great Breath” with its great periodical recurrent “out-breathings and in-breathings”; ceaseless pulsation may be said to be Its one attribute. It is this essential nature which is meant in the phrase “I emanate again and again this whole assemblage of beings, without their will, by the power of the material essence”. “Without their will”, may be understood by considering that no human being is in a body because he—as such—desired to be; nor does he leave his body because he desires to; the impelling force proceeds from the inner self. the real man. “By the power of the material essence” may be understood by considering the state-</font></span></p>

Just as each one may say, “I was in a child body and had experiences pertaining to that state; I passed through the changes of body and circumstance up to the present, and will pass through all changes to come, but I remain the same unchanging identity throughout all conditions.”</font></span></p>

The One Self is the self of all beings. The Upanishads say that “the Self shines in all; but in all It does not shine forth.” Krishna says that the deluded fail to recognize this Self, and judging from appearances and arbitrary classifications, maintain separateness. So acting, they set in motion causes that produce similar effects— in other words, bad karma.</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘ Krishna’s teaching throughout, emphasises the statement that there is but One Spirit and not several,—the same Spirit animating all beings and sustaining all. The same power to perceive is possessed by all alike. The differences in beings consist in the range of perception which has been acquired through evolution, and this applies to all lives below Man, to Man himself, and to all beings higher than Man. In “The Voice of the Silence” it is said that “Mind is like a mirror; it gathers dust while it reflects,” and in other writings Mind is spoken of as “the mirror of the Soul”. We cannot fail to see that we act in accordance with the ideas of life that we hold; that what we call “our mind” is a number of ideas held by us as a basis for thought and action; that we change ideas from time to time, as we find occasion for such change; but that at all times we act from the basis of ideas presently held. The reason for the differences between human beings is the false, imperfect or true ideas , form the basis of thought or action are or one to accept and hold only such</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">ideas as are in accord with our personal desires. Krishna presents an example of what, among us, would be called a good desire, that of “those enlightened in the Vedas”, whose desire is for a personal enjoyment of heaven; these, he says, obtain and enjoy that heaven for a period of time proportionate to their merits, and then they sink back to mortal birth. He concludes by saying “thus, those who long for the accomplishment of desires, following the Vedas, obtain a happiness which comes and goes. But for those who, thinking of me as identical with all, constantly worship me, I bear the burden of the responsibility of their happiness”. The words “constantly worship me,” have an explanation further on, in the chapter where he says, “Whatever thou doest, O Son of Kunti, whatever thou eatest, what-ever thou sacrificest, whatever thou givest, whatever mortification thou performest, commit each unto me”. The real “worship”, is devotion to an ideal. Here “the Self of All” is the ideal, and the action indicated is to think and act for, and as, the One Self in all things, without self-interest in the results. We are not attached to results by our acts, but by our thoughts; freedom comes from a renunciation of self-interest in the fruit of actions.</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE title given is “Devotion By Means of the Universal Divine Perfections”. The words “Universal Divine Perfections” have a significance not usually perceived. Men speak of perfection from the standpoint of imperfection, and always in relation to forms, conditions and appearances that are constantly changing; so that with humanity in general the standard of perfection is an ever-receding and elusive, as well as delusive idea. Here again, as with our modern science, we reason from particulars to universals, instead of from universals to particulars, never perceiving that nothing less that the cause itself could ever know itself.</font></span></p>

Our doctrines and education lead us to think that we are inherently imperfect; if we are so, we can never by any possibility become</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">perfect; but if we are inherently perfect, we can see, understand and correct imperfect knowledge and use of all forces, for it is forces we are dealing with, not forms; it is ideas, not persons. We will begin to under stand that there is but one force or power— the Spiritual, and that all the various effects of that one power or force that we see and experience, are due to the direction given by conscious entities of many kinds in their different degrees. To understand the “divine perfections”, they must be applied universally, from the standpoint of the One Self—the Self of each, the Self of All.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Gita is laid out in the form of a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, as between a divine teacher and his disciple and may be so understood, it can also be applied in another way; Krishna is the Higher Self in each, and Arjuna, the mind, the mirror of external impressions; so that the dialogue can be profitably taken as a means to the realization of the Self, and Its adjustment and control of the lower elements and forces. The key-note of the ancient teaching is that the creative and sustaining power of all things and beings is not to be sought for externally; it can only be found at the very root of the nature</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="center"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">166</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">of each and every being. As it is put in the Upanishads, “The Self-Being pierced the openings outward, hence one looks outward, not within himself.” The wise, who seek the Eternal, look inward, for “that which lives and thinks in Man is the Eternal Pilgrim” (S. D.). It is necessary then for the student to dwell upon the idea that he acts for and as the Self of All; that the power to see all, and to know all, is potentially present with him, is in fact his real Self. He will at least then understand when Krishna says “Neither the assemblage of the Gods nor the Adept Kings know my origin, because I am the origin of all the Gods and of the Adepts”; “I am the origin of all; all things proceed from me,” that he is speaking of the Self of All and of each, and that the origin of that which is Eternal and unchanging is not to be discovered, for it is both Being and Non-Being. As Patanjali states it, “The Soul is the Perceiver; is vision itself, pure and simple, and it looks directly on ideas”. This means that each human being has the power to see and know all things, however restricted that power may be at any given time; that the restriction lies in the more or less narrow range of the ideas that he adheres to, and which form the basis for</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">his actions. This self-limited range of perception, not only prevents the full exercise of his powers as Self, but acts as a bar to the right understanding of his observation and experience; so, even the man of today may say, “I am the origin of all things; all things proceed from me”, for so far as he is concerned, his adopted ideas and acquired nature form the basis for all causes set in motion by him, and also constitute his field of observation and experience of effects. By the very power that resides in Self, Man creates good and evil, the delusion of separateness, and all imperfections. Divine perfections are universal; they can only be reached by acting for and as the Self in all things. This state can be obtained by a gradual elimination of all bases of action that make for separateness.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arjuna begins by stating to himself (Krishna), the characteristics that to him designate the very highest place and power. “Thou art Parabrahm” (beyond Brahmâ) “thou art the Eternal Presence, the Divine Being; all-pervading; without beginning.” “Thou alone knowest thyself by thy Self.” “Thou alone can fully declare thy divine powers”. “How shall I, constantly thinking</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reply begins with: “I will make thee acquainted with the chief of my divine manifestations, for the extent of my nature is infinite. I am the Ego which is seated in the hearts of all beings; I am the beginning, the middle and the end of all existing things.” He then goes on to recite that among the gods, the Self is the highest; among planetary bodies, the Sun expresses It; among the spirits of the air, the chief of these is an expression of It; among the sacred writings, It is the essence of these—the all-compelling song or sound; and so on through a long list of forms, powers and qualities understood by Arjuna. He concludes by saying, “I am, 0 Arjuna, the seed of all existing things, and there is not anything, whether animate or inanimate, which is with-out me”. “My divine manifestations are with-out end, the many which I have mentioned are by way of example. Whatever creature is permanent, of good fortune or mighty, also know it to be sprung from a portion of my energy. But what, 0 Arjuna, hast thou to do with so much knowledge as this? I established this whole universe with a portion of myself and remain separate.”</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arjuna had asked Krishna under what particular form should the Self be worshipped. Krishna’s reply was “under all forms”, that there is nothing in the universe, animate or inanimate, which is without the Self. The seeker for Truth and knowledge must see the One Self in all things, and all things in the Self, and then act for and as the Self of All. All sacred writings are addressed to the individual, for it is from within the individual, and the individual alone, that reformation can begin and must be consummated. The study and application of the Gita tends to break down all ideas based upon separateness, and impresses upon the student that the way of true knowledge of the divine perfections lies in universal service, without distinction of caste, creed, sex, color or race. “Self-Knowledge is of loving deeds the child”</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arjuna begins in this chapter by saying, “My delusion has been dispersed by the words which thou for my soul’s peace hast spoken concerning the mystery of the Adhyatma—the Spirit.” He had perceived that the One Self animates all forms of every kind; that the sustaining power, as well as the perceiving power is with in each and every form; but he desired’ to see and understand the form or container of Self; in other words, the means by which the One Self became focussed—so to speak—in the innumerable forms of existence.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krishna in reply gives the key to the answer in one sentence. “Here in my body now be hold, 0 Gudakesha, the whole universe animate</font></span></p>

But as with thy natural eyes thou art not able to see me, I will give thee the divine eye.” Here, it is evident that the body Krishna spoke of was a spiritual one, since it required the divine eye to see it, and that Arjuna could not perceive this highest form unless he himself possessed similar sight. Body implies form and substance, and in this relation must mean the highest conceivable primordial matter or substance, which to us might be comprehended as “luminosity and energy,” the source of all light and power.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words “the Divine form as including all forms” imply that there are no forms but those which the Divine form includes, from which it may be understood that the substratum of every form is the same primordial substance spoken of in this chapter as “the divine form,” and that every being possesses a divine form which contains within it potentially every power and element. In this ancient teaching is to be found the true basis of evolution, an unfolding from within outwards.</font></span></p>

From the “point” whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere, a radiation equal in all directions begins, and establishes a circumference; a sphere within which the activity of the “point” is particularly confined. The “point” spreading out horizontally becomes a diameter dividing the sphere into positive and negative hemispheres, forming a basis for action and reaction. A further extension of the point vertically to the circumference divides the sphere into four parts, represented on a plane surface as a cross within the circle. Remembering that these extensions of the “point,” or center, are lines of force proceeding from the center and tending to return to it, we can conceive of the beginning of a revolution of the sphere whereby the ends of the vertical and horizontal lines extend towards each other, forming at first the ansated cross, and finally the square within the circle, in reality, a cube or six-sided figure within the sphere. The cube, if looked at from either side presents the appearance of four angles,</font></span></p>

We are not our “minds,” for we change them whenever we find occasion to do so; if we were our minds we could not change them, and further, it is apparent that “change” cannot see “change ;“ only that which is permanent can see change. That permanency is the Real, the immortal Man, or, as the “Voice of the Silence” states it, “the Man that was, that is, and will be, for whom the hour shall never strike.” Each is the Self, the Perceiver; non-being, yet the cause and sustainer of being; as the Gita states it in this chapter, “thou art the Knower and that which is to be known ;“ “thou art the final supreme receptacle of this universe”—the garnerer of all experience when this universe is dissolved.

Even Arjuna, loyal and devoted disciple as he was, had failed to perceive the wondrous nature of his teacher. It was not until that teacher by his favor and power had caused “the divine eye” in Arjuna to open that the ability to see on that plane of substance was gained. It is natural to suppose that Arjuna had by his unshaken confidence and constant devotion arrived at a stage of development where such help was merited.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might be well for students of Theosophy to consider whether they may not have made a similar mistake in regard to Those who brought the message of Theosophy to the Western world, and so kept closed the only door through which direct help could come.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the closing portion of the chapter Krishna says: “I am not to be seen, even as I have shown myself to thee, by study of the Vedas (scriptures), nor by mortifications, nor alms giving, nor sacrifices.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following, written by one of the Teachers, may serve as an explanation of the foregoing paragraph. “Ishwara, the spirit in man,</font></span></p>

To have faith, is the holding of a conviction of the truth of that upon which one’s faith is fixed. There are many “faiths” in the world, some adopted because of ignorance, credulity and superstition: others, because they appeal to the desires of their adherents; others again, because of the partial truths they hold. That which is lacking in all these is “knowledge,” for a conviction held in ignorance only perpetuates ignorance and its results: a conviction held from desire only perpetuates desires and their results; a conviction held because of partial truths perceived indicates a little knowledge, but not enough to distinguish the error that is always mixed with partial truths. The “faith” spoken of by Krishna is that which is founded on self knowledge—or knowledge of the Self as being All, and in All. A reliance upon that Supreme Self, and an identification of one’s Self with It, presents an unchanging and unchangeable</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the reply of Krishna which closes the eleventh chapter, these words are found: “I am to be approached and seen and known in truth by means of that devotion which has me alone as an object.” Arjuna follows in the twelfth chapter with the question: “Among those of thy devotees who always thus worship thee, which take the better way, those who worship the indivisible and unmanifested, or those who serve thee as thou now art ?“</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Krishna’s reply embodies the following:</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “For those whose hearts are fixed on the unmanifested the labor is greater, because the path which is not manifest is with difficulty attained by corporeal beings.” A foot-note explains that “The difficulty here stated is that caused by the personality, which causes us to see the Supreme as different and separate from ourselves.” The tendency of human beings is to think and act as persons in their relations with other human beings and with manifested nature in general, and although they may ardently desire to act “for and as the Self,” they find themselves constantly falling under</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words “Or those who serve thee as thou now art,” refer to the form in which Krishna was best known to Arjuna. That this was a human form is indicated in the previous chapter, where Arjuna says, “Having been ignorant of thy majesty, I took thee for a friend, and have called thee ‘0 Krishna, 0 son of Yadu, 0 friend,’ and blinded by my affection and presumption, I have at times treated thee without respect, in sport, in recreation, in thy chair, and at thy meals, in private and in public; all this, I beseech thee, O inconceivable being, to forgive.” In this sentence Arjuna recognizes Krishna as a divine incarnation, a being who had reached perfection and who had voluntarily incarnated in order to help those still struggling in “this ocean of incarnations and death.” That such divine incarnations have not been infrequent, both before and since the time of Krishna, is shown by a study of the world’s great religions; the rationale and meaning of such incarnations is clearly shown in the “Secret Doctrine.”</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The course of every Arjuna—and each one of us is just that—is first a recognition that</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">true knowledge must exist, and an ardent desire to obtain that knowledge. Then comes a search for the source of that knowledge; in that search lies the danger for the seeker. He finds many teachers, to knowledge. While as yet he has no means of determining the true from the false, he will accept ignorantly that teacher or teaching which his ideas and desires. This unf6rtunately is the course of most seekers. But there are to be found others who examine carefully the fundamental bases of the teachings offered, and who will accept only that one whose foundational propositions can be so universally applied that their truth be comes self-evident.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A resumé of the previous chapters will show that Krishna pointed out to Arjuna the various forms of belief and practice—or devotion— followed by men, and that these, though partial and erroneous, would finally lead to the one Truth if the seeker was sincere and devoted in his search for it. At the same time the One Reality or Truth was shown to be accessible to all men, and to be the highest, most direct and noblest path, leading to understanding wisdom and true happiness.</font></span></p>

For knowledge is better than constant practice, meditation is superior to knowledge, renunciation the fruit o action o meditation; final emancipation immediately results from such renunciation.” It has been said that the Source of all beings is One; that the goal is One; but that the Path varies with each pilgrim. Hence each pilgrim is at a point of evolution or development where one or other of the steps presented is within reach. Each of these steps is shown to be leading in</font></span></p>

Krishna says that final emancipation immediately results from such renunciation, thus placing complete renunciation as attainment of the goal. Renunciation is superior to meditation because is by meditation upon the end in view that renunciation comes; meditation is superior to knowledge because right knowledge produces right meditatio</font></span><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Palatino Linotype">n ;</span></font></p>

Both, however, were and are learned chiefly in repeating what they have heard of as occultism, with no substance or reality underneath all the profession. Now, as then, .,the mere incidentals of the true occultist’s practice are thought of, spoken about, and pursued. Phenomena or the power to produce them constitute the end and aim of these searchers’ efforts. But seek as we may, we will not find among them real knowledge, real experience, true initiation. Being on the wrong path, deluded by false light, they cannot do aught but mystify, annoy, and deceive those who put their trust in them.

Particularly is this so in that wonderful book, the Bhagavad-Gita. In it however void of phenomena, however unattractive in respect to bait for psychic emotion, it points out the way, declares the mystic science, true devotion, right action.”</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been said of this chapter that it contains the whole of occultism, by which is meant, that all-inclusive occultism which begins with the highest point of perception and realization—the Self within, and which regards action and reaction on every plane of manifestation, as the process by which individual and universal power and wisdom are attained.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That which stands in the way of knowledge is ignorance, and from the point of view of true occultism, the root of all ignorance lies in misconceptions as to one’s own essential nature.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this chapter Krishna treats of devotion by means of the discrimination of the body from the soul, meaning thought and action based upon a knowledge of what is body and what is soul.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ahankara-egotism, Buddhi-intellect or judgement, the unmanifest, invisible spirit; the ten centers of action, the mind and the five objects of sense; desire, aversion, pleasure and pain, persistency of life, and firmness, the power of cohesion. In this statement are included all that the ordinary mind conceives of as conscious existence, and purposely so, for if we are to arrive at an understanding of what is permanent, we must first see clearly what is impermanent and perishable.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the divisions given by Krishna, Ahankara is placed first because in it is to be found the main cause of differences. Ahankara is the tendency to identify ourselves with forms and conditions; from that self-identifying attachment all the variations proceed; intellect or judgment is based upon that self-identification, as are all the likes and dislikes, modes, and channels of action.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we can grasp the idea of the perishable nature of Ahankara-egotism, the perishable nature of the other elements can be understood. It is a fact that we do identify ourselves with the ever-changing perishable body, and with its conditions and relations, which</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="center"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">190</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">are also ever-changing. We say, “I am happy, or I am sad,” “I am sick or I am well,” “I am contented or I am dissatisfied,” all of these expressions being due to some form or condition which is changeable. We should observe that the self-identifying attachment is chiefly concerned with the present form and conditions, although we are aware that other forms and conditions have existed in the past, to which we were attached by like or dislike, and that still others will exist in the future.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through all the changes of the past we have gone; through all the changes of the future we must go. The past changes have perished; the present changes are perishing; the future changes will also perish; but “we” remain through them all, unchanged and unchanging. If we can grasp this idea and hold to it, we will have taken the first step towards right knowledge and freedom, for, as an ancient sage has put it, “The soul is the Perceiver; is assuredly vision itself pure and simple; unmodified; and looks directly upon ideas.” In this chapter are the following statements of a similar kind: “I am the knower in ever mortal body ;” “As a single sun illuminateth the whole world, even so doth the One Spirit illumine every body ;” “He who seeth the Sup-</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">reme Being existing alike imperishable in all perishable things, sees indeed ;“ “Perceiving the same lord present in everything and every where, he does not by the lower self (Ahankara) destroy his own soul, but goeth to the supreme end.”</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be apparent to every one who thinks, that to be immortal necessitates being change less, for that which changes has no stability. There could not be a continuity of consciousness even through one physical existence, un-less there is permanence of identity; the same “I” has noted the conditions, ideas, and feelings from childhood up to the present time, and will note them through all the years to come.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Western mind of ours finds a difficulty in reconciling “changelessness” with “progression ;“ this is because of Ahankara, the tendency to identify ourselves with forms and conditions. Forms and conditions do change, but not of themselves; there is That which causes change to succeed change, and That is the indwelling spirit, which continually impels the instruments It has evolved towards further perfection. So progress and evolution mean an unfolding from within outward, a constant impulsion towards a better and better instrument for the use of the Spirit—the Self within.</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term “body” has been used throughout this chapter, but it must not be supposed that only the physical body is meant. The physical body is included in the term, because itself is the product of involution and evolution from higher states of substance or matter. Krishna says “Know that Prakriti or nature, (sub stance), and Purusha the spirit, are without beginning. And know that the passions and the three qualities are sprung from Nature. Nature or prakriti is said to be that which operates in producing cause and effect in actions.” There can be no action unless there is something to be acted upon; that something is the highest substance; it is that which fills all space, and from which all denser forms of sub stance or matter have been evolved, and within which they are contained. Thus, the body represents on this plane all the other states of sub-</font></span></p>

A study of the Seven Principles of Man will give an understanding of this statement, if it is remembered that Man, the Thinker, is not any of his principles; they are his vehicles or instruments.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Individual spirit or Purusha is said to be the cause of experiencing pain and pleasure” (through the connection with nature found in the instrument) ; “for spirit, when invested with matter or prakriti experienceth the qualities that proceed from Prakriti; its connection with these qualities” (and self-identification with them) “is the cause of its rebirth in good and evil wombs.”</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘ Krishna says that “the passions and the three qualities are sprung from nature” (prakriti). The three qualities represent attachment to bodily existence through love of that which is good and pleasant (sattva) through a propensity for passion and desire (rajas); and through heedlessness, which destroys the power of judgment. They are all due to self-identification with one form or an other of bodily existence.</font></span></p>

It is the cause of all manifestation and the holder of all knowledge gained thereby. Causing and perceiving change, It changes not. All power and all law proceed from It, are inherent in It. This is the meaning of “Spirit,” where Krishna says in conclusion: “Those who with the eye of wisdom thus perceive what is the difference between the body and Spirit, and the destruction of the illusion of objects, go to the Supreme.” By the “illusion of objects” is meant, the seeing of the objects as different from Spirit.

Both abound in classifications; those of the East are much more numerous than those of the West and cover a far wider field; Western psychology in its classifications refers solely to mental states. The psychology of the Gita and the ancient sages classifies the moral states, treating the mental states as mere effects produced by moral conditions. Herein lies the secret of the hold the Gita has had all down the ages, and continues to have increasingly. It lays bare unsuspected bases of error; it discloses the most subtle forms of self-delusion ; it marks out the true course so painstakingly that the dullest mind cannot fail to grasp a clear perception of the path to true knowledge.</font></span></p>

The differences in human beings are found in the degrees of attraction which each one has for one or other of the qualities.

If so, the quality of Sattva is there to some degree, even if only for the time being. To the individual, Sattva is that which seems good to him, even though his prevailing quality be Rajas or Tamas; so the bee seeks and appreciates the sweetness in the flower, but is ignorant of the flower’s nature or purpose. While every form in the three kingdoms of nature has its own peculiar quality, whether consciously or unconsciously expressed, yet the perceptions of these qualities depend upon the nature of the perceiver, his understanding and knowledge. Good and evil are relative; Nature may not be classified as part good and part bad. The goodness, the passion and desire, the ignorance, indifference and folly are in ourselves. The path to Sattvic perception and perfection begins with the feeling of responsibility for thought, word and deed, and ends in unselfishness.</font></span></p>

Here it would seem that “indifference” and “darkness” are synonymous terms; for that which we call indifference arises from ignorance of the true nature of things, events, and beings; it might be called the selfishness of ignorance. There are, of course, many degrees of Tamas, as many in fact as there are minds, for Tamas is indicated wherever there is ignorance, folly, idleness, and delusion in any degree.</font></span></p>

It is Ahankara, self-identifying attachment with the ever-changing forms, conditions and relations of physical existence that makes the real “separation” and binds men to re-birth in a world, which they make one of infinitely more suffering than of joy. “He, O son of Pandu, who doth not hate these qualities—illumination, action and delusion—when they appear, nor longeth for them when they disappear; who, like one who is of no party, sitteth as one unconcerned about the three qualities and undisturbed by them, who being persuaded that the three qualities exist, is not moved by them; who is of equal mind in pain and pleasure, with those who like or dislike the same whether praised or blamed; equally minded in honor or disgrace; the same toward friendly or unfriendly side, engaging only in necessary actions, such an one hath surmounted the qualities.”</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these words Krishna presents a symbol used by men to indicate the universe as an eternal evolutionary stream, proceeding from a changeless Source. This Source, though changeless Itself, produces change in ever- increasing differentiations throughout the great period of manifestation. When the limit of differentiation is reached, the same impulse gradually indraws all differentiations toward homogeneity. This evolutionary process is graphically symbolized in the Secret Doctrine as the Great Breath, with its periodical out breathing and inbreathing. Neither the “out breathing” nor the “inbreathing,” nor both together, describe or constitute the Great Breath, for these are actions by That which has the power to so act.

These formulations are here properly symbolized by “leaves,” for they shoot forth from the branches (the three qualities), have their period of manifestation and are replaced by other “leaves”.</font></span></p>

It is not thus understood by men who are bound by Ahankara, the self-identifying tendency of the thirteenth chapter, but it may be realized by “those who are free from pride of self and whose discrimination is perfected, who have prevailed over the fault of attachment to action, who are constantly employed in devotion to meditation upon the Supreme Spirit, who have renounced desire and are free from the influence of the opposites known as pleasure and pain.” Knowledge of the Supreme Spirit comes from identification with It; realization comes from dwelling upon the thing to be realized. The “power to perceive” is the very essence of our being, our perceptions are not that power, they are the exercise of it; our perceptions are the bases of our actions; it is because we identify ourselves with our perceptions that we are deluded and bound by the actions that flow from them.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “There are two kinds of beings in the world, the one divisible, the other indivisible; the divisible is all things and the creatures”—that is, all forms and objects of every kind, since every form and object is composed of minor forms or expressions of life or consciousness.</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our bodies, for instance, are composed of mineral, vegetable and animal lives and substance; these are borrowed from the three kingdoms below us and are returned to them; hence the term “divisible”. “The indivisible is called Kutastha, or he who standeth on high unaffected”. In every composite form—and all forms are that—there is a synthetic consciousness which has evolved and sustains that form; that synthetic power is unaffected by any changes in the form. In Man Kutastha would seem to indicate the Divine Ego, whose divinity and spiritual nature remain as such through all forms and changes.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “But there is another spirit designated as the Supreme Spirit—Paramatma—which permeates and sustains the three worlds. As I am above the divisible and superior to the indivisible, therefore both in the world and in the Vedas am I known as the Supreme Spirit. He who being not deluded knoweth me thus as the Supreme Spirit, knoweth all things and worships me under every form and condition.”</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Devotion through Knowledge of the Supreme Spirit begins with a recognition that there is but one Spirit, the source and sustainer of everything that exists. As the Upanishads say “the Self shines in all, but in all it does</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">not shine forth”. The Self is in all things, and all things are in the Self. Whatever there may be of “shining” through any form or under any condition, that “shining” is from and of the Self. If this is recognized and admitted, we must begin to regard all things and beings in that light and act towards them upon that basis; in this way we act for and as the Self, and as we hold to and follow that practice, all ideas, habits and desires that conflict become overcome little by little, until at last we have the supreme power for good that comes with selflessness.</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN this chapter Krishna begins with an enumeration of the “godlike” qualities. It will be noted that these qualities or virtues are not so numerous as they are comprehensive and complementary, and that taken as a whole, they fully express the title under which they are assembled—a godlike nature.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we come to examine these qualities from the modern point of view and compare one with another, we may find it difficult to reconcile some with others: as for instance, “power” and “fearlessness” with “freedom from conceit”. Our individualistic tendencies incline us to think that a sense of superiority is necessarily present with power and the absence of fear. And again, if we take the simplest, most definite and most easily understood of these qualities, “not speaking of the faults of others”, we see only a pale and negative virtue. Yet fault-finding is the most universal and most insidious expression of conceit and self-assertion. Speaking of and pointing out the faults of others is a vice which masquerades under many forms of virtue but</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="center"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">208</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">in reality it is used to hide our own faults and present the appearance of a righteousness we do not possess—a vice which perpetuates self-delusion and negatives every apparent virtue. St. Paul, the Initiate, in I. Corinthians, Chap. XIII, says in this regard:</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass and tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.”</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charity implies the possession of all the virtues, for they are all included in it; it implies the absence of fault-finding and condemnation. But charity is not negative; that which makes charity effective is knowledge, not sentiment; hence the need of discriminating between what are here called “godlike” and “demoniacal” natures.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must therefore enquire into the meaning of Discrimination. It is a faculty, or power, whose range and value depend entirely upon the knowledge and understanding of the individual using it. All men use this faculty but in as many different degrees as exist between</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="center"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;209</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">the densest ignorance and the highest intelligence and wisdom. It may be called the ability to do the right thing, at the right time, and in the right place, on every plane of action. This necessitates a universal point of view, an understanding that covers the whole of nature, and a universal application of both.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ancient wisdom of the Gita begins with universals and descends into particulars, this being the course of evolution. It posits One Spirit as animating all beings and all forms, and shows the universe to consist of an aggregation of evolved beings of innumerable grades, each with its own form and tendencies, and each acting according to its own acquired nature. Whatever accords with the acquired nature of each being, will appear to it as good; whatever obstructs or opposes it, will appear as evil; this being true, it is self-evident that good and evil are not things in themselves, but are appearances due to the of the perceiver towards things, forms, conditions and circumstances.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No such considerations as the above could be addressed to any being lower than Man, because he alone, of all those in physical forms, has reached that point of development of his acquired nature which enables him to grasp</font></span></p>

He has reached that point at which he can know himself to be Immortal, and may, if he wills, bring his acquired nature in accord with his own spiritual nature. All of his perceptions are of the “pairs of opposites’; without these he could never find himself, nor understand the natures of those who are struggling to free themselves from the binding force of with forms and conditions.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be understood that Man the Eternal Pilgrim, is not his perceptions, for they are always relative. In all perceptions are to be found “the pairs of opposites”, for no perception could exist without them. Without darkness, there could be no perception of light; without pain, there could be no perception of pleasure; without sorrow, there could be no exception of joy; without sin, there could be no perception of holiness. That these perceptions are all relative to the Perceiver is shown in the fact that what is light to some is darkness to others; pleasure to some is pain to others; joy to some is sorrow to others; holiness to some is sin to others.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the lack of understanding of these facts</font></span></p>

All sects present formulas which must be accepted on faith, but which cannot be proved to be true. Many systems of thought affirm the unproven and unprovable and on facts of experience, thus ignoring law and justice in the universe; they deny the effects they perceive, on one side of nature, and affirm as self-existent the effects they perceive of an opposite kind, deluding themselves by offsetting one ef-</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As before said, true discrimination proceeds from a universal point of view, an understanding The ‘whole of nature, and a universal application of both. The universal point of view is that all manifested nature, including all things below Man, Man himself, and all beings above Man, as well as all forms, degrees of substance, and elements have proceeded from one Source, the One Spirit. The understanding comes from a realization that, from atom to the highest being, each is an expression of that One Spirit and that from the faintest glimmering of perception in the lowest kingdom to the heights of Divine Knowledge, the path is the same for all under Law. Then comes the application of the knowledge gained.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The student must raise himself beyond “the influence of the pairs of opposites.” He must</font></span></p>

And as he raises himself above that influence, he will find others like himself, and still others beyond who are of a godlike nature—who love and understand; who possess what appear to others as virtues, but which to them are but actions with spiritual knowledge as director; who understand the vices of men to be due to ignorance and not to innate wickedness; and who hence have patience, power and fortitude, universal compassion, modesty and mildness. They know that that which makes for evil can be turned into that which makes for good; that which makes for destructiveness can be turned into that which makes for constructiveness; that which makes for separation and selfishness can be turned into that which makes for unity and selflessness. So knowing, all nature is theirs, every power and element in it are their instruments; not that the relativities of good and evil can or should be destroyed, but that the spiritual identity of all beings shall be realized at every stage, and only such thought and action prevail as will bring about a harmonious progress towards perfection.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="center"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">214</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True Discrimination distinguishes between good, evil, and mixed natures. It knows that all human beings are inherently perfectible, and that the imperfections exist only in the lower acquired nature; that while this acquired nature exhibits itself in actions, its root lies in tendencies fostered by limited and erroneous conceptions. The effort is therefore not expended in classifications of comparative good and evil, nor is there any condemnation of any being because of the state in which he is found to be ; the causes that have led up to each state are shown, the right basis for thought and action is given, the landmarks upon the “small old path” that leads far beyond comparative good and evil are pointed out, and the pilgrim patiently helped, on every step of the way.</font></span></p>

This lowest class of elementaries and elementals belongs to the grossest part of invisible nature, is nearest to the physical, and most easily aroused. The opening of the doors to this class arises from ignorance of man’s true nature, and makes possible the delusion which fixes the faith on impermanent, irresponsible and vampirizing influences. Tamas also predominates in “those who practise severe self-mortification .....are full of hypocrisy and pride, longing for what is past and desiring more to come; they, full of delusion, torture the powers and faculties which are in the body, and me also, who am in the recesses of the innermost heart; know that they are of an infernal tendency.</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">no doubt that these practices had their origin in a misunderstanding of a phrase frequently used in ancient scriptures “mortification of the body.” In this chapter Krishna sets forth very clearly the true meaning of that phrase in these words: “Honoring the gods (beings higher than Man), the brahmans (those who have divine knowledge), the teachers (of knowledge), and the wise; purity, rectitude, chastity and harmlessness are called mortification of the body.” That this is the true definition is shown by the fact that the body of itself is incapable of action, and is merely an organized aggregation of physical matter used and controlled by the thinker and actor within; it is this thinker and actor who needs to change his modes of thought and action. In changing from one mode of thought and action to an other of an opposite kind, the man finds him self at war with habits which he himself established; these have to be dis-estäblished by the institution of habits in accord with his changed basis.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chapter continues by saying “This three fold mortification or austerity, practised with supreme faith, and by those who long not for a reward, is of the sattva quality.”</font></span></p>

How many are given “out of place and season and to unworthy persons, without proper attention and scornfully?” Each one must answer for himself. It takes a very wise man to do good works without danger of doing in calculable harm; one such might by his great intuitive powers know whom to relieve and whom to leave in the mire that is their best teacher. The poor and wretched themselves will tell anyone who is able to win their confidence what disastrous mistakes are made by those who come from a different class and endeavor to help them. Kindness and gentle treatment will sometimes bring out the worst qualities of a man or woman who has led a fairly presentable life when kept down by pain and despair. The Gita teaches that the causes of misery do not lie in conditions or circumstances, but in the mistaken ideas and actions of the man himself; he reaps what he has sown in ignorance. A better knowledge of the nature of man and the purpose of life is needed; as this is acquired, the causes of misery are gradually eliminated.

Krishna does not enjoin any particular kind of food; he says that kind of food for each one is best “which in creases the length of days, vigor and strength, which keeps one free from sickness, of tranquil mind and contented, and which is savory, nourishing, of permanent benefit and congenial to the body, is that which is attractive to those in whom the sattva quality prevaileth.”</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many who fix their faith on particular kinds of food and who endeavor to convert others to that particular kind of faith. They, like all others who fix their faith upon externalities, are “false pietists of bewildered soul.” The question never is of kinds of food, but of fitness for each particular case; for when all is said and done, each body extracts from any kind of food only that which conforms to the nature of the possessor of the body, and that nature is subject to change from within. The main thing to be observed is to keep the body efficient as an instrument for the soul who inhabits it, by whatever means and food may be found necessary for that purpose. Here, like and dislike are set aside and only the purpose of soul is considered.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="center"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">224</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE chapter begins with this question from Arjuna: “I wish to learn, O great-armed one, the nature of abstaining from action and of giving up of the results of action, and also the difference between these two.”</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole of the chapter is devoted to the answer. Not only are the nature of abstaining from action and the giving up of the results of action involved in the reply, but an understanding of the very nature of action itself and the causes and bases of action. Relating to the “agents of action,” Krishna says:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Learn, O great-armed one, that for the accomplishment of every work five agents are necessary as is declared. These are, the substratum, the agent, the various sorts of organs, the various and distinct movements, and with these, as fifth, the presiding deities. These five agents are included in the performance of every act which a man undertaketh, whether with his body, his speech, or his mind.” Again, that “whoever, because of the imperfection of his mind, beholdeth the real self as the agent, thinketh wrongly and seeth not aright.” It is</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="center"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">227</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">thus evident that it is not the “real self” that acts, a statement that has been reiterated throughout the previous chapters, and one that it is necessary to understand before the nature of action is comprehended.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prakriti or nature, is the cause of all action throughout the universe, as it is the basis by which action may take place; this is true on every plane of being. In the thirteenth chapter are these words: “Know that prakriti or nature and purusha the spirit are without beginning. And know that the passions and the three qualities are sprung from nature. Nature or prakriti is said to be that which operates in producing cause and effect in actions; individual spirit or purusha is said to be the cause of experiencing pain and pleasure. For spirit when invested with matter or prakriti experienceth the qualities which proceed from prakriti.” This passage throws some light on the meaning of “the substratum :” it is substance in its primordial state from which all differentiations proceed, and within which all differentiations are contained, and therefore forms the basic agent of all action; the word “agent” in the classification may be understood as the power which prompts to action; for instance, the personal self with its concrete and</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">limited ideas, impels the organs of the body and the necessary movements to carry out the prevailing idea. The fifth “agent” is called “the presiding deities”; this latter term may be explained in this way: our bodies are composed of small lives of many different kinds, each of those kinds acting only in response to particular impulses; each class acts according to its own nature, and as a class constitutes a hierarchy of being, devas or deities.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is understood, of course, that That from which all power to perceive or to cause action emanates is the Self of All; that power be comes particularized, so to speak, in the Individual Self, who on higher planes is the impeller of actions on those planes; on the physical plane, the Personal self is but a temporary aspect of the Individual Self, this aspect being sometimes called the “false ego” because of its delusion; it is this personal self which consciously or unconsciously to itself impels the lives in his bodily organs to action.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we may understand better this passage from the fifth chapter: “the devotee who knows the divine truth thinketh, 'I am doing nothing’ in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing; even when speaking, letting go or taking, opening or closing his</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">eyes, he sayeth, ‘the senses and organs move by natural impulse to their appropriate objects.’ ” It has been said that the Self neither acts nor is acted upon; this must be true also of the Personal self, for, as the thirteenth chapter says: “the spirit in the body is called Mahaeswara, the Great Lord, the spectator, the admonisher, the sustainer, the enjoyer, and also the Paramatma, the highest soul.” The self or spirit in the body is deluded by the three qualities perceived in nature, liked or disliked, and identifies itself with the actions it induces. “He who seeth that all his actions are performed by nature only, and that the self within is not the actor, sees indeed.” There is also this passage, “The path of action is obscure. That man who sees inaction in action and action in inaction is wise among men.”</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we reconstruct our ideas in regard to action as above indicated, it will throw a new light on karmic responsibility, connecting us more intimately with all selves, all lives small and great, and assist us to a better realization of acting for and as the Self.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">est intellection, the power of judgment, according to its various degrees of activity. These degrees flow from attraction to one or other of the three qualities found in nature, and are described as follows: “The discerning power that knows how to begin and to renounce, what should and what should not be done, what is to be feared and what not, what holds fast and what sets the soul free, is of the sattva quality. That discernment, 0 son of Pritha, which does not fully know what ought to be done and what not, what should be feared and what not, is of the passion-born rajas quality. That discriminating power which is enveloped in obscurity, mistaking wrong for right and all things contrary to their true intent and meaning, is of the dark quality of tamas.”</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the “discerning power” there must also be the “power of steadfastness,” for unless we are constant in devotion to the higher life, and the ideal of a conscious life in spirit, not matter, we will be recreant to the best we know. Having reached the power of discernment and having been shown the path which to us is peculiarly ours, we should set aside all other considerations that tend to draw us from it; we should cultivate and practise “That power of steadfastness holding the man to-</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The “power of steadfastness” may exist without the highest power of discernment, as in the one who looking for the fruits of action, cherishes duty, pleasure and wealth from the point of view of desire or rajas; or in the man of low capacity who stays fast in drowsiness, fear, grief, vanity and rashness, bound by the tamasic quality.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we have determined for ourselves the nature of action, the goal of true discernment, and steadfastness which is harmony of thought, will, and feeling, as well as an action on the lines of our determination, we can only have done so through something of that “wisdom which perceives in all nature one single principle, indivisible and incorruptible, not separate in the separate objects seen” and which is of the sattva quality. It is the changeless Self within, which, if we follow the lines of our determination, we will come to realize more and more.</font></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All our thoughts give rise to action among the lives which compose our astro-physical instrument, and, as we never cease thinking, action continually goes on, for, as often said, “thought is the real plane of action.” Even though we may not contemplate any immediate bodily act, we may by our thoughts accumulate a tendency in the lives of our instrument which will eventually result in outward action when ever favoring conditions permit, and we will fail victims to our lack of discernment and steadfastness, as well as involve others in our fate.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Now hear what are the three kinds of pleasure wherein happiness comes from habitude and pain is ended.” We may get some understanding of this sentence if we consider that when some ardently desired aim or object is sought and found, there is at first happiness, and the pain of non-attainment is ended. But the happiness does not remain the same; it resolves itself into contentment and habitude,</font></span></p>

To arouse oneself from desiring, or from carelessness and indifference is at first “as poison,” but with a purified understanding becomes “the water of life.”</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The statement that “there is no creature on earth nor among the hosts of heaven who is free from these three qualities which arise from nature,” points to the fact that the three qualities exist on every plane of being.</font></span></p>

Then there existed natural castes</font></span></p>

Nevertheless, the castes exist everywhere; but no longer does social position or physical environment distinguish them. In all countries at the present time, there are those in high place and power who by nature are Sudras, and many who are Brahmans by nature are lower in our social scale, for this is Kali Yuga when the powers of darkness are in the ascendancy.</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ancient castes performed duties which. were the outcome of their several natures, and were so recognized by all. There was no pride of caste nor jealousy and there existed an ideal community of mutual helpfulness; hence, the duties of the castes were “determined by the qualities which predominated in each.”</font></span></p>

A man’s own natural duty, even though stained with faults, ought not to be abandoned. . . . The highest perfection of freedom from action is attained through renunciation by him who has an unfettered mind and subdued heart.”</font></span></p> 
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt" align="justify"> <span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dharma is the word which in our language is translated as “duty,” but it has a much wider range and meaning than that which we accord to the word “duty.” There are many who think that duty is something that others think we should do; others again consider “duty” to be irksome, and as actions to be performed under duress, and therefore to be avoided; it is therefore necessary to grasp the meaning of the word “duty” as used in the Gita. Dharma means “the sacred Law,” the fulfillment of our karmic destiny through many incarnations, the working out and elimination of defects which have brought us into earth life under the conditions in which we find ourselves, which conditions we should feel and know to be the very opportunities needed for our further progress. This is why one of the great Teachers wrote,</font></span></p>

And having thus attained to the Supreme, he is serene, sorrowing no more, and no more desiring, but alike towards all creatures he attains to supreme devotion to me. By this devotion to me he knoweth fundamentally who and what I am and having thus discovered me he enters into me without any intermediate condition. And even the man who is always engaged in action shall attain by my favor to the eternal and incorruptible abode, if he put his trust in me alone. . . . And if, indulging self-confidence, thou sayest ‘I will not fight,’ such a determination will prove itself vain, for the principles of thy nature will impel thee to engage. Being bound by all past karma to thy natural duties, thou, 0 son of Kunti, wilt involuntarily do from necessity that which in thy folly thou wouldst not do.”</font></span></p>

The view-point taken, out of the seven different applications possible, is that of the individual, in accordance with Mr. Judge’s early comments, but even from that view point, the field has been by no means fully covered. It is hoped, however, that enough has been said to afford at least a little more light to those who aspire to learn the Science of Devotion..</font></span></p>
