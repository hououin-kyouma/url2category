             <h2>Free study resources: Free term papers and essays on College Papers</h2> 
             <p>We are offering free complimentary access to thousands of free essays and term papers on almost every subject imaginable. The free College Papers essays do not interfere with our services: We know how much people like free resources and just want to keep the visitors on our site and illustrate the advantages of our services by exposing the drawbacks of using free resources. Please note that the free papers hosted on this site have been donated by college students. Those are not our writers' products and are not indicative of the quality of our services. To examine the real quality of our services please visit the Work Samples page.</p> 
             <h2>Free essays and term papers take a lot of time to find and tweak</h2> 
             <p>There are thousands of free essays on-line, however, browsing through categories takes forever to finally locate the right piece. Moreover, free College Papers papers are rather outdated and most likely will feature neither current research nor correct citations. The structure of the papers will make you spend hours to tweak in order to finally match your professor's instructions.</p> 
             <h2>Errors, typos, incorrect grammar and word choice</h2> 
             <p>If you want to do your project all by yourself, we can respect that. You are free to use our free papers and tell your friends about our site. You will need to spend hours because the papers are presented on as-is basis and we do not guarantee them to be any good. They may contain errors, types, incorrect grammar, incorrect sources, poor research, to name just a few.</p> 
             <h2>Use our services to save time and grade</h2> 
             <p>If you are not willing to spend hours browsing through our essay collection and need services of a qualified writer, you can order <a href="http://www.dreamessays.com/services/custom_term_papers.htm" title="Buy Term Papers" style="text-decoration:none;color:#000000;">custom term papers</a> or <a href="http://www.dreamessays.com/services/custom_essays.htm" title="Buy Essays" style="text-decoration:none;color:#000000;">custom essays</a> on absolutely any subject.
