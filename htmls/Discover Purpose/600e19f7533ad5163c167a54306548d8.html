      <p>Would you like us to pray for you or your loved ones? Please feel free to share your prayer requests with us and our readers here at Our Catholic Prayers using the form below! You can include anyone you’d like, living or deceased. </p>
      <p>Rest assured that we will keep your e-mail address confidential and will not sell or otherwise share it with anyone. You can give your name or an abbreviation if you wish. </p>
      <p><b><i><u>We post prayer requests as they come in, on this page, following the form given below, usually within a day or two of receiving them. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO POST THE SAME PRAYER REQUEST MORE THAN ONCE ON ANY GIVEN DAY. </u></i></b></p>
      <p><b><i><u>Please note as well that due to the large volume of prayer requests we receive, we cannot publish more than one post for prayer requests from the same person on any given day, except for those requests involving emergencies. We're trying to give as many people as possible a chance to be heard on this prayer line. We apologize for any inconvenience.</u></i></b> </p>
      <p>Prayer is a beautiful, as well as essential, way to ask for Our Lord’s help and blessings. Even when God doesn’t answer our prayers as we’d like, He gives us the grace to cope with our problems and tragedies better in any case. </p>
      <p>Don’t think that any request is too small! Our Lord Himself said “ask, and you shall receive” (John 16:24). Your requests become that much more powerful when others are praying for you as well. Also, it is a truly divine form of charity to pray for others, especially for those most in need! </p>
      <p>As Pope Gregory the Great once wrote “He causes his prayers to be of more avail to himself who offers them also for others.” In other words, as our Lord said in Luke’s Gospel “Give and it shall be given to you” (Luke 6:38). And, as a popular saying goes “God cannot be outdone in generosity!” </p>
      <p><b><i>“Pray for one another, that you may be healed” (James 5:16)</i></b> </p>
      <p><b><u><i>AN IMPORTANT REMINDER: WE ASK YOU PLEASE NOT TO POST THE SAME PRAYER REQUEST MORE THAN ONCE ON ANY GIVEN DAY!!!</i></u></b></p>
      <p>Please pray for the peaceful repose of the soul of my father William who passed away on November 26th, 2015. He was 86 years old. Also, pray for the peaceful repose of the soul of his brother-in-law Larry, who passed away on May 31st after a long bout with dementia and Parkinson's Disease.

      <p>10/5/17: I have been struggling emotionally and physically for the last 3 years with alcohol abuse which has caused me to lose every single one of my friends and boyfriend. I have been severely depressed. And for the last 6 months I have been unemployed, which has made my depression 100% worse. I finally got offered an amazing job out of state that is contingent on a drug screen. Where I currently live marijuana is legal and I have been a heavy user because it is the only thing that seems to take my mind off how sad and depressed I’ve been. I have completely stopped using marijuana a while ago in preparation for a pre employment drug test. Yesterday I took the test and I am scared I might not pass it due to the marijuana still being in my system. I am scared I will completely lose myself if I don't get this job because I failed the drug screen. Please pray for me that I pass this drug screen so I can take this job and start fresh in a new state. Thank you. Madison<br></p>

May God bless you all, as your pure heart is source of belief for many more like me. I request for a prayer, that the love of my life, my Hitali, comes back to me, leaving all the fears and anxiety behind, keeping faith in God and trust in our bond. Together we can make things work, I have full belief. We met with God's wish, started to understand and support each other. Love happened in its due course. We felt it like a spark, and expressed with compassion. With time, love became a vibrant shine in life. Her smile became reason for me to smile. We shared our feelings and promised to live together. Everything was going smooth, and then some bad luck entered our life. Her parents rejected me on financial and society grounds. I went to her city Chandigarh to talk to her father, but it was my bad time, the situation got worse and I was rejected again, with a complaint added that I'm not allowed to talk to her. She loves me, but the suffocation has failed her courage. Our love needs prayers and blessings to come out of this bad time. Please, brothers and sisters. Pray for us, for our love to conquer this hard time, and flourish again with God's grace. Accept my thanks for your kind time. Bless you all. Manik&nbsp;<br></p>

I ask this to happen very soon. Also, I am praying for my youngest son Kurt, 25, who lives in Harrisburg, PA. He thought he found the perfect girlfriend who he had wanted to marry, but all she saw him for was a way to get things. This past Saturday, they broke up because he found someone who could spend money on her all the more. Since then, my youngest son has been drinking a lot. I need him to come back up here where he is safe and sound and his family will help. I also need to pray that we have money to pay all our bills. It has been a real juggle just the same. We have had so much stress and our health hasn't been so good. Please pray that this all gets better as well. I would also like to pray for my dad, Joseph John Stokes born 10/2/29. He passed away on 4/02/99. We all miss him more then I tell you.

      <p>9/8/17: Ever since I was a kid I always had a weird bite. I had a speech problem that I thought was my fault. I struggled to speak, which hurt my self-esteem. I understood my limits and what I could say. I clenched my teeth for a period of time. I fought suicidal thoughts and survived terrible times due to this condition. It has hurt my ability to build relationships, or just to enjoy my life. I was an open breather. I read that you need to keep your lips sealed and your tongue behind your teeth. Well, I already had a big tongue and doing this caused the back of my tongue, the muscle, to get bigger or thicker and block my airway, and to create a gagging, choking reflex steadily affecting me and creating breathing problems and stomach vulnerability. Discomfort. Pain, burning occasionally. I’ve thrown up earlier this year from it. I have balance issues and motor problems due to my teeth. My teeth want to touch and connect themselves before having a normal bite/relationship. So I can't rest my jaw and turn my head like a normal person. I have to mimic movements and try to replicate normal behavior because I am physically impaired. &nbsp;It causes severe depression, isolation, speech difficulty, physical anxiety, suicidal thoughts. I have learned to talk through non-normal means of having to move my jaw and teeth to override physical makeup. It has hurt me academically, socially, my self-confidence. I've survived all these years believing things will get better. I tried applying for disability but it's hard. I'm a strong person and I have so much I want to do for the world. But how can I help them if I can't even help myself? Please help me. Heart pressure, sharp pain. Rib cage feeling like it's stuck in my stomach or something is stuck. I had to go to the ER. Carl</p>

      <p>9/4/17: We all have battles. Some are illnesses, some are family, some are marital or companionship related, but for us it has always been finances. I'm a well skilled woman but can never seem to make the money necessary to cover my bills. Every day of my life I'm buckled down with the worries of "how will I pay this", "how will we eat". This has been most of my life and I'm nearly 40 now. I have an amazing relationship with God and have prayed so much and so hard about this. All I want to do is serve The Kingdom of God and I have so many ideas about how this can be done. However, I can never seem to focus just on Him because I am every day of my life overwhelmed about finances. My appearance has recently declined, health is starting to take a beating, and the drive inside of me for being a general in this army of God has calmed down quite a bit. It's still there. Just over-masked by all of this day to day nonsense. Pray for me brother and sister and I will, too, pray for all of you. Be blessed. B.</p>

      <p>8/20/17: I am requesting prayers as I feel my family will be separated. We are close to losing our home because of financial troubles, and my wife seems to be looking for an escape. Our children are now both college age and leaving for school, and with the loss of our home I fear a total separation. I have made many changes in recent years, but feel alone and unloved. I know God is with me, but sometimes it isn't enough. I seem to seek feeling loved more each day but I'm true to my vows I took. I feel that I'm about to lose everything. Please pray for me that I will have the strength to handle this with Grace and accept his will. If only he would intervene and allow what I hope to save, which is my family. Mike<br></p>

      <p>8/19/17: Urgent prayer; I just feel so lonely. I feel I’m in a marriage being taken for granted. We never go anywhere or do anything as a couple because my husband doesn’t care or shows any interest in me. I just feel let down by my children that I’m not treated or respected as a mum either. I just feel burdened. Since I got married it doesn’t feel like I’m married. I have to look after myself all the time financially. &nbsp;I feel let down by friends too. I do everything for everyone else but no one would think I need care. I need to be treated special. Please open people’s hearts, Lord, to show more love and support. Heather<br></p>

      <p>8/18/17; I was wrongly accused of fraud and conversion in a business deal. In the trial I showed proof of what I had and the opposing counsel changed their course of fraud because I proved they were wrong in their accusations and now assailed my character to go after me for money because of the opposing lawyer’s desperation to come after me. He was relentless in pushing the judge to believe all sorts of lies because I proved I am innocent in fraud. I have asked God to forgive my oppressors, and now the Judge is deciding in the case whether to charge me for something entirely different than what was initially brought to court. We didn’t even think of making against a different accusation, as it changed during the trial. So I ask Almighty God to supernaturally vindicate me from all the lies of the devil, as this is a huge spiritual battle of all sorts coming against me. I know God our loving Father has a great plan for me and that’s why the enemy is coming against me with a vengeance. But vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord, and I pray the Judge will rule in my favor and remove any accusation against me, as I am not guilty of any fraud or conversion. I ask this prayer in Jesus’ Name that God’s hand will come to help me in a mighty way and my accusers will see the Glory of God’s power working in me; and that the enemy will retreat from harming me. In Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen, Alleluia, Amen. Nira<br></p>

      <p>8/18/17: Pray that my daughter turns away from a pornographic lifestyle, and returns to church. She became Catholic two years ago, and stopped going to Mass after her first reconciliation. She told me she no longer believes in the church. She since has a boyfriend and lost her virginity after she assured us she'd never have sex. Now, she performs acts of perversion and wants to get married before she graduates high school. She has been sexting him. She once had goals of getting an academic scholarship to college, and one year later, she wants to get married and have children. Please pray for her, and pray that God can intervene into her heart, mind and soul. Please pray the Holy Spirit will return to her. Please for my depression caused by her actions and behavior. She's still a good girl that has lost her way. Brett<br></p>
      <p>8/18/17: Please pray for me S.A.C. and my daughter A.S.C. that the providence of God will fall on us as we are getting poorer and more in debt to survive. The sisters-in-law have been busy with evil as we are poorer. Apartment Rent increase soon; electricity costs more debts than we have. It’s purely basic survival stuff, no luxuries; and yet they have been flourishing daily all of a sudden since May with brand new cars and loads of cash. And yet they filed for bankruptcy and are all blacklisted. People are looking for them for debts but can’t find them and they never answer their cells or take calls. My daughter and I have to look after my 80 year old mother, as she is just left to clean and look after their home. Lord, have mercy on us and expose the evil doers that pretend to love Christ and yet never contribute towards the poor. This has to stop, these leaking pockets and vampires stealing from good trying Catholic people.<br></p>

That my husband may return to us and that he may leave the military and everything else that is causing him to stray. That we both open our eyes to all we do wrong and be given the strength and courage to what is right and necessary, regardless how difficult it may be. Our separation has been going on for over 2 years and I grow physically, emotionally, and spiritually weak. May God have mercy on us and fill us with the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;Johanna<br></p>

      <p>8/18/17: Please pray that God will help me and my elderly mother. We are living under oppressive conditions. there are a lot if injustices here. But because we are both low income, we cannot afford a market-rate apartment. The waiting lists to get into other subsidized housing are 3-5 years long. Also, the management here does not enforce the non-smoking rule. I am a lung cancer survivor. 2nd hand smoke is dangerous to me. Please pray in Jesus name that God will provide us with the finances needed to move to a place that is clean, safe, friendly, and where no one smokes. For my entire life (60 years) I have struggled with health problems.

      <p>8/16/17: I feel ruined. Michael M. said to me and I believe him, “the bank hates you and your friends hate you. Only I love you with all my heart”. What’s more, he says everybody on Guam hates me and doesn't want me happy. Furthermore I am stuck here with a threat of a North Koran ballistic missile aiming our way, but Michael wants me to claim the 975,000, which is weird because they want money for it. Also, he showed me his plane ticket on the internet to arrive on Guam September 16th, and his son Kelvin will show up on September 25th. If he wants it that badly why doesn't he foot in the rest for the other stuff like the over 1,000. It doesn't make sense. Also they say it's a scam. I wonder if it's because I feel helpless surrounded by hate and abuse in many different ways by many different people with none to relieve me, not even the law. It doesn't seem there is a God in my life keeping me safe and protected from all these evils. Also I am economically disadvantaged and alone. I go to church but surrounded by lack of love, oftentimes unfeeling, uncaring, even merciless people, even with confession and communion. It doesn't seem like God is there for me. There is no love. Pray that I have a good friend, good friends, a husband who likes, loves, and respects me and will always protect me. &nbsp;A lot of times, on Guam most especially, they treat me like I am not human. Now Guam is being threatened by a nuke by North Korea. Well, a lot of people don't know how to treat peoples with disabilities. Most of the old mental health clients are dead. Pray for me and for us, my family and friends, and for Michael and Kelvin. Also pray for a happy family for all of us. Cynthia<br></p>
      <p>8/16/17: Please pray for me Lord, that good things will come to me. I’m worried about money. Coping with paying for things I &nbsp;need. I’m missing a dear friend too.

The two older ones only contact me whenever they are looking for things. Family has just let me down. Open their hearts. Heather&nbsp;<br></p>
      <p>8/16/17: Please pray for my daughter Alyssa, who has been trying to get a job for over a year now.

That in God’s time or his time that he will come back to me. I pray that he and I will be patient and walk with the Lord.

      <p>8/14/17: While transferring a major stroke patient two hours away on a rainy night, the Marion County Ambulance hydroplaned and rolled the ambulance. The patient and one EMT received injuries. Evidently, the EMT driving submitted false information when she applied for the position. It's since been discovered that she was operating on a non-valid drivers license and the Ambulance District is being sued by the stroke patients' family. My brother is the Director of the Marion County Ambulance District. I am asking prayers for all involved in the accident and for the safety of my brother's job. He is fair, compassionate and has worked very hard to earn that position. The background check on her came back fine, so she was hired. Please pray that my brother doesn't lose his job because of HER false documentation. Thank you! Rose<br></p>

      <p>8/14/17: Please pray for us, as we have been in a relationship for about 12 years, but things always get bad. This is disturbing because we can’t even be good for a month without fighting and being apart for weeks or months, then afterwards getting back together. Chris<br></p>
      <p>8/14/17: That I will learn to stop worrying and realize he is 27 years old and has to lead his own life. Please help him to find a steady job. Please bring peace to me and let him continue to pursue what he knows he needs to do. Sharon<br></p>

      <p>8/14/17: My son is struggling with alcoholism and is very angry with a situation in his life in regards to being left by girlfriend who lied and cheated on him. His father committed suicide when he was 10 years old, so this has put him into a very evil place in his mind.

      <p>8/14/17: I have been dealing with chronic bad breath for years. I’ve been to the doctor so many times and he doesn’t even know what to do. I’ve been praying for a cure, and sometimes I wonder, does God hear my prayers? This odor has really taken over my life. I pray that God will heal my body. I am a firm believer in prayer and I know God works. I just get so overwhelmed because I don't even know what is causing it. I need doctor Jesus to lay hands on me and cleanse my body and wash away my chronic breath odor. Please pray for me. I'm not going stop praying. I feel like my prayers are not strong enough.

They’ve been married for 4 years now. Son Alroyd backed out totally within one month of a 3 month shipping training course due to extreme nervousness. He was unable to meet their hurried schedule.

May she attend rosary recitation, and Holy Mass after 40 years of not doing so. That the entire family is delivered from all bondage and healed completely; and that that daughter Lourdes and son Linus obtain secure jobs as soon as possible. That sister Margaret’s daughter Alisha and son Shaun get God fearing partners in Jesus Christ and are blessed with marriage. And above all, that all of us come to Jesus Christ without any threats or dangers; in repentance of all our sins breaking all ten commandments. May we forgive one another and be saved and filled by the power of the Holy Spirit, amen, amen and amen. Thank you and God bless you one and all. Julian<br></p>

      <p>8/13/17: Please pray that I get good news in regards to my DSP pension as I'm unwell, kind regards. Annoula</p>

      <p>8/13/17: Austin needs prayer. They can't explain what's wrong with him, I don't know. We took him to the doctor. All tests come back clear. He sees people. They come in through windows and doors, but there is one more powerful. He can come through anywhere. He's been up days, eyes matted. He can't rest. Lord, please help him.<br></p>
      <p>8/13/17: I ask for your prayers once again. Please pray that I walk towards God and not away as I am doing now. I've been praying for financial help for so long now I feel as though I have been abandoned. I believe God is not with me. I filed for bankruptcy about 3 months ago. I've been praying for a job for so long. I finally found one 6 months ago. My boss was fired for not being compliant and I was let go. I can't pay my rent. I live alone. My parents have passed away, and my son does not speak to me, for now. Conversions are funny things. The road is so narrow I can barely breathe. I feel myself walking away and I don't want to. My prayers are few but they're there a bit. I won't give up. I haven't gone to church in a few weeks. Please pray for me for strength, for humility, for peace, for fear of the Lord, to be wise, to listen, to pray, to help my conversion and to find a job quickly. I will pray for all you. Diane<br></p>
      <p>8/13/17: I am wandering like a thirsty soul for a spring of living water. Let this Church be my living water. &nbsp;Here I am attending Mass for the first time in my life. Let my attendance of this Mass marks a new beginning in my life. If you are the same God who answered the prayers of Elijah, Hezekiah, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, I pray you to answer my prayer today and rescue me from the demonic bondage of Elizabeth M. and whoever obstructs my employment. Let me feel the presence of the Holy Spirit in me day and night, in Jesus name I pray Amen. Destroy the demonic shrine or cult houses where my name, resume, curriculum Vitae and Cover letter had been taken to or would do anything to obstruct my employment. According to the Scriptures, whoever waits on you would never be ashamed. Answer my prayer and set me free, remove all obstacles from my life, and send your legion of angels to fight and win the spiritual warfare waged against me by enemies of progress. This is my prayer in Jesus’ Name. Amen. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth, by the power of his cross, his blood and his resurrection I am requesting you to pray God to protect me and my children from all demonic forces day and night in the name of Jesus. Amen. To set me and my children free from all evil spirits. To destroy all Shrines and cult houses where my name and my children were mentioned or used to obstruct my employment. Destroy all demonic shrines where my bad dreams originated and give me a job as CPTM, or VCES at MH effective August 2017. This is my prayer in Christ’s Name. Amen. I would today submit an application to the city and County for the first time. I pray that it be accepted and no demonic forces obstruct me, in Jesus Name!! Amen. Ebenezer&nbsp;<br></p>
      <p>8/13/17: Dear Lord, prayer for God to heal all of us with dental needs. I also need implants and cannot afford them dear Jesus.

      <p>8/13/17: &nbsp;I have submitted my aims (a respected position in the church or in the very next society) to the concerned authorities, and I have been waiting for a positive response since 2008. As years roll on without closure I am in part despair. I have neglected my civic life while submitting for this position. I wish the church, whose head is the Lord himself, to make me a positive contributor by empowering me beyond high school niceties. As an aspirant to holy orders, perhaps I lack victory over sin. I plead for the right type of guidance to overcome this sticking point. Vinod</p>
      <p>8/13/17: Please pray for my husband Robert, who goes back to his old habits, even often. Most members of his family have a strong hold on him that is bad to his spirit within him. My family is kind but not genuine to him because he is weak. Robert needs the spirit of God to fill and teach him who he can be within Jesus Christ. I believe in God so I am not giving up, but sometimes it just seems he is taken over by the demons in him. I believe in the Lord God for a miracle of a changed man not only for us in marriage but for himself to be a man of Christ Jesus. Dios del cielo puede misericordia en su alma. K.B.<br></p>
      <p>8/13/17: Dear prayer friends, please pray for Louise and Patricia, that they may each meet a man who will become a husband. Someone with their faith who wants to make a good life with them. Josephine&nbsp;</p>

Sometimes I feel desperate with a lot of anxiety. I can't stop worrying about my son who is suffering from mental illness. Heal him and give him courage, strength, guidance, and wisdom to continue. He is going back to school and he needs all your help. Heal my shoulders. Help my mom with comfort. She is in a lot of pain. Bring my children back to church and that they always love you. Amen<br></p>
      <p>8/13/17: Dear Lord, please bless all of the people on this site with the desires of their heart. Thank You for all You have done so far with Steve and me. Please continue to have him think lovely thoughts of me throughout each day. Have him miss me message me several times each day. Have him call frequently. Have him use increasing more caring and loving words to me. Have us see each other monthly or more. Open his heart to You again Lord. Heal his afflictions. Give him financial blessings. Open his heart to me. Have him see me as a girlfriend. Have his feelings for me grow stronger every day until he loves me above all others. Remove the obstacles that have held him back. Have us be in a loving, faithful, committed relationship soon, Lord. Have him ask me to move close to him. Father I know I am asking a great deal but I believe you put him in my life for us to be together. I thank You for the answer to these prayers and I ask for strength and patience as I wait for You to answer. Father, I will pray persistently. I will not give up. I have faith in You Lord. I have faith in prayer. I ask all this in Jesus' Holy Name. Amen. Lisa<br></p>

      <p>8/12/17: I will be meeting with my ex girlfriend this upcoming Wednesday evening after 4 months of silence following our breakup in April. We both want to rebuild our friendship and I want to get back together with her. (She doesn't seem to be open to that; at least not at this point.) I pray that this meeting produces positive results and that God may open her heart, eyes and mind to the possibility of getting back together again, in addition to rebuilding our friendship. I also wanted to thank God for allowing the silence to be broken, and for allowing us to have this opportunity to meet. Noah</p>

She never asks anyone for help, she is such a strong beautiful person. I pray that God will spare her from her cancer. I need her around. She is all I have, and she is loved by many. Please Jesus, I need a miracle, and will do anything for her to stay with me on earth for many more years. I love you and so does she. She used to go to church all the time, but in the last month she has not been able. Please, I pray in Jesus' Name. Amen! Kerrie<br></p>
      <p>8/12/17: Father in Heaven humbled before you this morning I desperately ask your mercy. I have but a few coins and need to drive my daughter across the country today for her new job. Bless me Lord with money to travel and pay my rent which is past due. Guide us Lord on this journey keeping us safe out of harm’s way or any trouble. Make a way, Lord, for me to have gas, a hotel, and food during this trip. I praise you for I know you opened this door for Jessi and will deliver all I ask. Amen. Natalie<br></p>

      <p>8/12/17: Dear Lord, please assist Bernard. Help him fight this unending battle which is weighing him down. Cover him Oh Lord with Your Precious Blood.

      <p>8/6/17: Please pray that my boyfriend's "foster" family can take him into their home in Florida. We have lost our jobs and rental and must separate in order to live. He has addiction issues, relapsed recently, and is solid in his recovery now.

He has nowhere else to go if his "foster" family (the family of a friend with whom he lived in high school when his father abandoned him) can't take him in.

      <p>7/31/17: I pray for my heart. It is aching. I miss my friend Q., who is so special to me. I pray that he values me still as much as I value him. Let him reconnect with me. He makes me happy. He fills my heart with joy. I love him, but he is pulling away from me. It is breaking my heart. I pray for love and enlightenment. I still pray that he be part of my life. K.<br></p>
      <p>7/31/17: Please pray that I'm able to find a job and that I'm able to become a better person. I'm having family problems as well. I just don't seem to understand my mom the way she acts towards me. I can't even go into the kitchen to make myself a sandwich because she gets frustrated to hear me in the kitchen. I just find that to be very weird. She's a very hard person to talk to and to make her realize when she's done wrong. I also think my brother her are doing dirty things. My brother is 18 years old, he has never gone to school, and he has always shared a room with my mom. I've walked in their room and I've seen her have her arm across the bed underneath a pillow that my brother has on his lap, and she right away moves it back to her lap. The first time I walked in her room and caught her doing that she acted extremely nervous and I could see my brother desperately trying to cover his area with the pillow. It's hard for me to accept that my own mother could be doing that to my brother, making him believe that it's ok. And maybe later on in life if he ever has kids he could end up doing the same to his daughter, I just find it to be very disgusting and disturbing. I haven't been able to confront her and ask her what's going on. It’s something just so uncomfortable and awkward to bring up. I feel like I've lost total respect towards her because I remember as a child her trying to make me touch her and I thought it was just some weird dream that I had. Now that I've caught her doing that with my brother it makes me think about what kind of family I live in. I used to be suicidal and she wouldn't sit down and talk to me. She would just say that the people that commit suicide go to hell, and now that I think about that how can she be so hypocritical to tell me something like that when she's doing that with my brother. She tries to act like she loves God and she's religious, but why would she do that to her own son, mess him up for life. I am 100% sure that she is giving my brother hand jobs I don't know if they do more than that but I'm sure even hand jobs are considered incest and are against God. I know it's a long message but I just don't have anybody to vent to. I wish I at least had a girlfriend so she could encourage me and help me, but I'm not even successful in a love relationship. I feel like a total failure. I feel angry, depressed, with anxiety and panic attacks. I'm always wearing a cap because I'm going bald and my self confidence and self esteem is low because of that. I'm only 24 and I know that I won't be able to wear a cap to an interview. I feel embarrassed. I want to feel motivated to put all that aside to put my social anxiety aside to get out of my bed and go look for a job, but it's hard. I don't even know what to think anymore. I've used people, I've hurt people and I feel as if karma is just doing its job and that's why all this bad stuff is happening. Please pray for me that God forgives my sins, especially the worst ones so I'm able to live a happier life to the fullest; and that he helps my mom and the rest of my loved ones too, to forgive them for their sins and to help them become better people. Gabriel<br></p>

      <p>7/29/17: Dear God, I have been asking for people's help to pray for my family just so you can hear our suffering. We have been harassed, bullied and harmed for the past 3 years now. It has been very bad, because besides hurting my family, they have been breaking things in our cars, because they know we barely have any money to get by and they know it hurts my whole family to get things repaired. They have been doing this on and off. They want me to do something for them which is not within my power and I know is wrong and will get my family in trouble. I'm so tired of being stressed everyday just waiting for them to mess with my family again. Either someone gets hurt or we have to spend money to get something fixed. The situation is so complicated that the only thing I can do is pray to God for help. My mom just went back to work 2 weeks ago after not being able to for 7 weeks because of what they did to her. Now they are hurting her again but not as much as before. My uncle too just had a car accident caused of them and he's still recovering from a heart surgery. They even mess with our dogs. There is no part of my life that they leave alone and I live in fear every day. I don't know what to do anymore. I believe that if this request reaches a lot of people that can help me pray maybe my prayers can be heard. Thank you. Raphael<br></p>

I'm so worried that my husband has no respect for me. I feel down and depressed because my own children don't talk to me because I married this man.

I fear maybe I have made a mistake. He hasn't made any effort to give me money either. Everything seems to have taken a downward slope big time. Please help me please. Hk<br></p>

      <p>7/19/17: We humbly ask everyone to please include my cousin Genesis T. D. in your prayers. He is fighting with a rare disease called Guillian-Barré Syndrome. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. The first symptoms of this disorder include varying degrees of weakness or tingling sensations in the legs. In many instances the symmetrical weakness and abnormal sensations spread to the arms and upper body. These symptoms can increase in intensity until certain muscles cannot be used at all and, when severe, the person is almost totally paralyzed. In these cases the disorder is life threatening, potentially interfering with breathing and, at times, with blood pressure or heart rate, and is considered a medical emergency. Such an individual is often put on a ventilator to assist with breathing and is watched closely for problems such as an abnormal heart beat, infections, blood clots, and high or low blood pressure. It’s said that most individuals, however, have good recovery from even the most severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, although some continue to have a certain degree of weakness. Matthew 18:19-20: “Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.“ Jeremiah 33:6: “Behold, I will bring it health and healing; I will heal them and reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth.” Thank you! Please share. Charmaine<br></p>

St. Jude, please intercede for me. &nbsp;Thank you Dearest Jesus, St. Jude, St. Francis of Assisi, St. Anthony of Padua, Blessed Mother and St. Joseph for prayers answered.

      <p>7/17/17: Hi guys, I ask of you to pray for my grandpa Alex in the Philippines currently dying and suffering from pneumonia. He is very weak. Because he doesn't have health insurance, he needs my parents and other members of our family to donate to help save his life. As far as I know, it costs $150 just to enter the hospital that's excluding fees and medicine and machinery/tech. 150 Dollars is 7587.75 Philippine peso, that's an incredible amount for a Filipino. I don't think my parents are in the position to donate that amount of money either. I honestly think he will die tomorrow or the next day. Please pray for his recovery, and if not, that God may have mercy on him and lead him to heaven. God bless you all. Dallas<br></p>

I urgently need to sell my beautiful home I have in Hartbeespoort, South Africa to settle legal fees as not working you cannot get the legal advice you need. &nbsp;I urgently have to sell up to sort out my levies and legal fees.

      <p>7/16/17: For all families, fathers and mothers alike who have children in Heaven either naturally or by abortion. For all Mission trips and those being ministered to. For all of those who wear Scapulars and all those who have, and pray the Rosary. For the security and covering of Carlotta and me. That I make my way safely into New Zealand with a fruitful, successful, productive, and graced stay. Please keep our future family lifted. For Vocations. For all of those who are and being abused. For The treatment and well being for those who are imprisoned, and for the warden and guard scandals to be exposed (because it's not like they show on T.V. The inmates actually get along very well, especially those that have a lot of time to do); that there may be health, healing, and revival for those who are imprisoned. A lot of time prisoners aren't allowed to shower and get toilet paper if the guards or warden go to work upset or mad. &nbsp;Mainly to soften and change the minds and the hearts of the guards and the wardens, especially those with the "Christian" title (Baptized), for them to be converted if they are not seeing Jesus in themselves first and then the inmates. May they not take their anger of the world, home life, etc. out on those they have sworn to love and protect, even in prison; because they are the ones that misuse and abuse the inmates all around the clock. That’s truly the reason how come a lot of times there is no change in the hearts and minds of those imprisoned. Selah<br></p>

      <p>7/8/17: Requesting prayers for my husband's healing from a tormented and unfinished relationship with both his divorced parents, but especially with his mother, Kathleen. He and his mother were estranged when she died and my husband didn't know she was dying until just a few days of her passing. Despite his attempts and my attempts to communicate with her, she decided not to communicate with him or me. Both his parents passed away without making peace with my husband, their only child. Requesting prayers so one day we can find a way to pray for his mother's soul. (I'm bitter about the way his mother treated him from the moment she was pregnant with him until the day she died; just a miserable woman so I can't even imagining comprehending how he feels.) Prayers so my husband can seek and find healing, and at some point conclude his grieving process from the mother he never had. Prayers so someone can pray for Kathleen’s tormenting soul. Prayers for his father Paul’s soul too. Both of their passing anniversaries are coming up, July 16th (Paul who died in 2012) and July 17th (Kathleen who died in 2015) Prayers so I can move on from this immense anger I feel towards Kathleen! We are still dealing with the aftermath of her last wishes which left my husband, me and our baby daughter in a bad situation with other family members. Pray for all of us, please! Thank you, and may God bless you all.&nbsp;<br></p>

      <p>7/6/17: Dear God, I am love with a girl who has a 40-50% hearing problem. I helped her in every up and down situation. I helped her during her exam and also with her looking for a job. I went to Nagpur (in India) along with her for her exam. She came to my house and we celebrated every festival together. We were in a relationship for the past 1 year and 4 Months. Due to family pressure, she broke up with me on July 4th during our anniversary. She wants to choose her life partner according to her family’s wishes. On weekends she will meet him (a boy chosen by her family). According to her, we cannot get married due to our being of different religions. I have not settled and my English is poor. However God, as you know, if you want to breakup then you will get 1000’s of reasons, but to get true love it’s very difficult. We were in love with each other a lot. That's why we have also had a physical relationship. Now if she chooses someone else as a husband and if he knows about our relationship than he will also feel very bad. Please God, if we did anything wrong then I apologize from my side and her side. Please don't punish us (me, her and that boy). I have not mentioned her name because I don't want to spoil her name as she is Catholic and I am Hindu. Please God, I pray that she will come back into my life as soon as possible. And that our parents will get ready for our marriage; and that we will get married and love, understand, and care for each other for the rest of our lives. Please God help me. I love her a lot. Amen! Hitesh<br></p>

      <p>6/24/17: I have lost all the people I love and there are plenty. Brothers, sisters, parents, cousins, friends, aunts, uncles, nephew. I miss them all. I have a daughter who for the past ten years has made my life miserable. She has never supported me through all the grief when it started, even though I threw my arms open to her in case she needed help. She has recently stopped me seeing my grandchildren, 8 and 4. The little one has learning difficulties and I've been telling anyone who will listen about this. It's only now something is being done. I knew he wasn’t right, but no one, including my daughter, would listen. Her hatred of me comes from me raising her, some other motherless children, working full time, and running a business. I was there at night. I never went out drinking, so although I worked she had me all the time. God knows all this I know, but through my loss and grief and the terrible things I've survived, with his help. She only let me have my grandchildren when she wanted a break. The loss started about 9 years ago when even though I lost my dad and only nana, at 14 she got pregnant. The first year we looked after her and our grandchild. So I say this God why after all I've endured and survived, abuse, drugs, poverty misery, and the list goes on &nbsp;and on, can you not help me while she takes away the one thing that has helped to keep me sane through the loss and tears? I need help now!! I've been so ill and fight all the time for others as well as myself but you know what? Without the children there is no point in going on. I love them and miss them every day and I was making real progress with my grief. So why have you let this happen why aren’t you helping me right now when I need you most? Pray for me, that my daughter kicks out the evil in her heart and lets me see the children soon. I ask you God, stop letting me feel you no longer care for me. My heart is heavy and my soul so very tired. I ask for your help now!! Blessed be God. Suzanne<br></p>

She only has 2% brain activity and though the doctors advised us to say our goodbyes I am not losing the faith of our God Almighty to put his healing hands on her.

      <p>6/12/17: Please pray for my brother Paul and his family. He lost his job after thirty plus years. His adult son is troubled and immature. He was on drugs. He swears he is no longer, but I have my doubts. His wife has been ill but survived kidney cancer and stress related illness. They are just in a very bad way. I don't think they pray.

      <p>6/12/17: Dear God, I am begging you as a mother for a miracle for our son Dominic. He has suffered so much over the last three years. Help him walk again and get some of his life back. Heal his nerves, muscles, and balance. Give him the strength he needs in his left leg to walk with one crutch and get some of his life back and work again. Heal his right knee. It is very sore at this moment in time. He has had to work much harder as the left one is still weak. I beg as a mother, help him get better. Give him the confidence, courage, and willpower to walk. Take away any doubts or fears in his mind that may be holding him back. Dear God, our hearts are breaking for him. He never complains, just working hard to get better. Hear and answer our prayers. Gillian<br></p>
      <p>6/12/17: I am going through such a difficult time and praying that God intervenes in the nullity of our marriage that my husband has filed. The procedures conducted are a cycle of formalities which were dubious and situationally controlled. The case is drawing to a conclusion and I don’t know how to be heard or fight the injustice. My 25 years of marriage are ending, even though I am open to reconciliation and to make amends where I failed. Hoping and praying for God to change my husband’s heart and mind; and at the same time that he recognizes the enemy and evil practices/force in our relationship/marriage over the years. I am in despair. &nbsp;Leaning on God to keep me from going into a dark place of depression, self-ridicule, and blame; and to relieve me from anxiety which I am facing every single day. I am being torn in half and it’s unbearable. Praying and hoping for a breakthrough to reunite in truth, transparency, love, peace, harmony, and strength. Kindly hold me in your prayers. Blessings!! DJL<br></p>
      <p>6/12/17: I need help! Someone has been entering my home when I leave and spraying stuff to make me sick. I must lock up my food in a closet when I leave and I have contacted many people, as well as an attorney, but no one will help stop this. I did no one wrong to deserve this and I am getting tired of fighting someone I never see. This is not in my mind! I have never been through nothing like this before in my life. I don’t have an income and live in public housing. I have nowhere else to go. This is at the hands of black magic or devil worshipers, because I find black hair on my floor many times and it didn’t come from me. Shandye<br></p>
      <p>6/12/17: Dearest Jesus, be with my mother in her recovery of her cancer, so she is healed of this cancer, multiple myeloma, and all illnesses and injuries.

Jesus, let my dear mother live a long time; and give her full assurance now and always of heaven, and take her to heaven when her time comes in Christ's salvation she has had for years. &nbsp;God, reward her greatly for the good she has done for her husband, us children, and many others, and for her pure obedience to you. Christ, guide her to the right treatment and work God's will through her doctors and through all so she has eternal victory over this cancer. God, let her trust, hope, obey, and trust in you all this completely in Christ, and do only good for her always and do not let her have any pain. Let her seek Christ all the way to heaven and find him always in every place, heaven included. God, do this for all of us.

      <p>6/11/17: Please pray for me and my children: Jullianne, Andrade, and Nathaniel. My children and I didn't ask for the crimes committed against us. For our health.

My daughter may also have cancer. And pray also for our finances. For my Spirit and that we may be free from the garbage from the people who want to control my life. Thanks for those who thru the power of the Heavenly God and the Spirit have instilled in my life some perspective and concreteness in what is best for me and my children. Neither of my children ever asked to be brought into the mess of people whose hands are full of blood way before I was born. May God forgive those that are adults handicapped and have done harm. Please we need prayers for our health and for those who are not related to me; and strength to all those who have worked hard and want to be free to enjoy life even when we are dying. Nerys B.<br></p>

      <p>6/11/17: We have been suffering a financial crisis since 2013 and until now there has been no alleviation. We are asking God's help but the main solution that we asking for is to sell our house and lot so we can pay our debts. We don't see any solution to end the problem but selling our properties. I am asking Almighty God to help me find a job since He didn't grant us the sale. Please God, give me the job offer that I received from an American company.
