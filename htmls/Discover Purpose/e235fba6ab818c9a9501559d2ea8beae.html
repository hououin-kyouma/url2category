        <p>If youâre in desperate need of some motivation, <em>weâre going to fix that problem, right here, right now.</em></p> 
        <p>Prepare yourself.</p> 
        <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Iâm going to swear and yell a little in this post.</p> 
        <p><strong>Desperate times call for desperate measures.</strong></p> 
        <p>You said you needed motivation. Iâm going to do <strong>what needs to be done to get your ass in gear</strong>. NO EXCUSES.</p> 
        <p>If this isnât the kind of motivation you need, leave now. <strong>Youâve been warned.</strong></p> 
        <p><span id="more-10421"></span>Alright.</p> 
        <p>Here goes.</p> 
        <p><strong>Do you want some motherfucking motivation right now?</strong></p> 
        <p>I SAID, do you want some MOTHERFUCKING MOTIVATION RIGHT NOW?</p> 
        <p>Do you want to <strong>get some seriously useful shit done today</strong>?</p> 
        <p>Do you want to get off your ass and start producing instead of wallowing in despair, depression, self pity, fear, doubt or whatever is holding you back?</p> 
        <p>Are you sick of not getting anything done?</p> 
        <p><strong>Letâs DO THIS.</strong></p> 
        <p>The point of this exercise is to give you motivation to <strong><em>do something right now</em></strong>. Donât just absorb this and continue sitting around procrastinating.</p> 
        <p>TAKE ACTION.</p> 
        <p><strong>Follow the steps below carefully.</strong></p> 
        <h2>1. Quit bitching about how tired you are.</h2> 
        <p><strong>The world doesnât care.</strong></p> 
        <p>And if youâre feeling depressed or down, stop feeling sorry for yourself while youâre at it. It doesnât matter.</p> 
        <p><strong>We all face obstacles.</strong> How you deal with those obstacles defines who you are and determines how successful you are in life.</p> 
        <p><em><strong>Did you catch that?</strong></em> It was the secret to life. Seriously.</p> 
        <p>Let me say it again.</p> 
        <p><strong>We all face obstacles. How you deal with those obstacles defines who you are and <u>determines how successful you are in life</u>.</strong></p> 
        <p>Period. End of story.</p> 
        <h2>2. Read the quotes below. If you have a favorite quote or two you always refer to, read that too.</h2> 
        <blockquote>
         <p>Some people die at 25 and arenât buried until 75. â Benjamin Franklin</p>
        </blockquote> 
        <blockquote>
         <p>Here is the test to find whether your mission on Earth is finished: if youâre alive, it isnât. â Richard Bach</p>
        </blockquote> 
        <blockquote>
         <p>Your time is limited, so donât waste it living someone elseâs life. Donât be trapped by dogma â which is living with the results of other peopleâs thinking. Donât let the noise of othersâ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. â Steve Jobs</p>
        </blockquote> 
        <h2>3. If the motivation you need is to work on building your own business, watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhqZ0RU95d4">this video</a>.</h2> 
        <p><iframe width="519" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EhqZ0RU95d4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> 
        <p>I donât care if youâve seen it before. Watch it again.</p> 
        <p>Be warned, if youâre not working towards being self employed, this video might push you in that direction.</p> 
        <h2>4. Put a pot of coffee on or get some tea brewing.</h2> 
        <p>Try a <a href="http://www.bulletproofexec.com/how-to-make-your-coffee-bulletproof-and-your-morning-too/">bulletproof coffee</a> if you need an extra kick.</p> 
        <h2>5. If you havenât eaten something, eat a little snack now.</h2> 
        <p>For godâs sake donât eat a fucking twinkie or some other junk food.</p> 
        <p>Eat something healthy. Eat some nuts or fruit. Take your vitamins.</p> 
        <h2>6. Do one of the following three things:</h2> 
        <p>A) Take a shower, OR</p> 
        <p>B) Go for a brisk walk, OR</p> 
        <p>C) Call the friend who most lifts you up and makes you feel great after every conversation. Tell him or her that you need a little pep talk. Put a 10 minute limit on the conversation.</p> 
        <h2>7. If youâre around people right now, go tell one of them how much you appreciate him or her.</h2> 
        <p><strong>Just say, <em>âhey, I wanted to tell you that I appreciate you becauseâ¦â</em></strong></p> 
        <p>If youâre not around people, think about something or someone youâre grateful for. Go over the reasons youâre grateful in your mind.</p> 
        <p><strong><a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2011/11/2011-happiness-challenge-for-those-of-you-following-the-2011-happiness-project-challenge-to-make-2011-a-happier-year-and-1.html">Gratitude is happiness</a>. Happiness is motivating. Be grateful more often by thinking about who and what youâre happy for, or by telling someone.</strong></p> 
        <h2>8. If you normally sit down to work, <a href="http://zenhabits.net/stand/">stand up</a>.</h2> 
        <p>Standing up to work is motivating. It gets the blood flowing.</p> 
        <h2>9. Turn off email, Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest <strong>and whatever other <em>social procrastination network</em> youâre part of</strong>.</h2> 
        <p>Turn off the TV if itâs on.</p> 
        <p>Seriously, TURN THEM OFF.</p> 
        <h2>10. Now, put on your favorite music playlist.</h2> 
        <p><em><strong>Play something that gets you jacked.</strong></em></p> 
        <p>Hint: try the playlist you use at the gym.</p> 
        <p><em>(If you donât regularly go to the gym or workout otherwise, start doing that tomorrow. You have to be healthy to stay motivated.)</em></p> 
        <h2>11. List the top 3 positive outcomes of achieving your task.</h2> 
        <p>Think about what youâre planning to accomplish today.</p> 
        <p>Donât worry about everything thatâs holding you back from accomplishing it. Instead, <strong>focus on the positive things that will happen once you get it done</strong>.</p> 
        <p>For example, if you have homework to do, your list might look like this:</p> 
        <p>1) Iâll learn something useful.<br> 2) Iâll make myself and my teacher proud of what I accomplished.<br> 3) Iâll get closer to achieving a good grade in the class so I can graduate and move on to doing what Iâm really meant to do in life.</p> 
        <p>Write down the three things. Donât skip this part. Make sure you focus on the 3 most important outcomes.</p> 
        <h2>12. Think about the part of <em>doing</em> this task that you enjoy.</h2> 
        <p>Most tasks have some enjoyable component to them.</p> 
        <p>Focus on what you like about what you have to do, no matter how simple or how small. Enjoy the very act of doing your task for what itâs worth.</p> 
        <h2 id="listentothispodcastepisode">13. Listen to this podcast episode</h2> 
        <p>Weâve just recorded an episode of our podcast about THIS VERY ISSUE.</p> 
        <p>If you want to listen to some motivation (and learn some tricks for <em>staying</em> motivated) you wonât want to miss it.</p> 
        <p><a href="http://fizzle.co/sparkline/how-to-stay-motivated-fs010">How To Stay Motivated (The Fizzle Show #10) Â»</a></p> 
        <h2>14. Now hereâs the most important part.</h2> 
        <p><strong>Lock yourself in a room with the thing you need to be doing.</strong></p> 
        <p>Donât leave until you make some progress.</p> 
        <p>Put pen to paper, fingers to keyboard, or axe to the grindstone.</p> 
        <p><strong>Stop looking for external motivation.</strong> Stop letting yourself procrastinate.</p> 
        <p>Start going through the motions of making progress. At first it might feel forced, but eventually youâll get in the groove.</p> 
        <h2>What to do if this doesnât work.</h2> 
        <p>We all have things to do that we really just donât want to do, but <em>have to</em> for some reason. These are the toughest to find motivation for.</p> 
        <p>For these especially difficult situations, I recommend two things.</p> 
        <p><strong>First, question whether or not this thing really needs to be done.</strong></p> 
        <p>What are the consequences of not doing it? Can you live with the consequences? Is there any way to not do this thing?</p> 
        <p><strong>Then, if you still conclude that this thing absolutely has to get done, focus on simply getting past it.</strong></p> 
        <p>Imagine the relief of not having this thing on your plate anymore.</p> 
        <p>How will that make you feel? </p> 
        <p>Dig deep. See how quickly you can possibly do this thing.</p> 
        <p><strong><em>Do it now</em> and move on to stuff you really want to do.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Top 10 Mistakes in Online Business</h2> 
        <p>Every week we talk with entrepreneurs. We talk about whatâs working and what isnât. We talk about successes and failures. We spend time with complete newbies, seasoned veterans, and everything in between. </p>
        <p>One topic that comes up over and over again with both groups is <strong>mistakes made in starting businesses</strong>. Newbies love to learn about mistakes so they can avoid them. Veterans love to talk about what they wish they had known when starting out. </p>
        <p>These conversations have been <em>fascinating</em>, so we compiled a list of the 10 mistakes we hear most often into a nifty lil' guide. <a href="/top-10-mistakes-starting-online-business">Get the 10 Most Common Mistakes in Starting an Online Business here Â»</a> </p>

           <p>Brilliant post!! Love it! </p> 
           <p>Your final part particularly attracts my attention as I am personally passionate about deeging really deep to uncover ALL the roots of obstacles holding me back and then work dilligently on removing themâ¦â¦ for ever :-) </p> 
           <p>So, in addition to your good advice, here are a couple of things Iâd do if I needed to motivate myself to do something that has to be done but I REALLY didnât enjoy doing it:</p> 
           <p>I would block the time in my diary that I will need to finish the task at least a week in advance. This way I would prepare myself psychologically for it e.g. use the week to TRULY and DEEPLY accept itâs ok to hate it with passion, that itâs ok to realy not enjoy it while doing it, that itâs ok to feel and act in the most unpleasant way while doing it (unless itâs customer facing of course) etc. You get the pictureâ¦basically, to me itâs about giving myself permission to be honest even if itâd be âfrowned uponâ â in this case miserable and pissed off with an joyless task at hand . This somehow manages to take the edge of my dislike and turns the activity into a humorous one. And things get done :-) </p> 
           <p>In addition to the above, I sit down, remember and write down examples of a few similar times when I completed things I disliked and was satisfied with the result. This I look at daily during the week of psyching myself up for the task.</p> 
           <p>This second method also serves another purpose: it reminds me that I can do things I âhateâ and that such a skill will come useful many a times again. So, itâs about building a toughness that will serve me well on my way to building my dream. </p> 
           <p>And last but not least, I also use many NLP techniques (working with my submodalities) to reduce the effects my demotivating states have on me â and they work a charm! :-) </p> 
           <p>Thanks for the great post Corbett! </p> 
           <p>Iâm now done with this particular procrastination :-) and am off to do some proper work :-)</p>

           <p>âDo it now and move on to stuff you really want to do.â Great anti-procrastination advice, because procrastination is rooted in the thought that we donât really want to do what it is.</p>

           <p>This post is AMAZING. I love Gary Vaynerchuk â I attribute leaving my job to his book Crush It (for better or worse). Watching him on video is insane- he is one jacked up man.

           <p>Exactly what I needed today. I think Iâll bookmark this. Iâve been working hard and hardly seeing any resultsâ¦and itâs easy to get discouraged. But I keep hearing people say to persist and just keep creating âepic shitâ and eventually things will start to happen. Iâve been at this about 4 months and I have devoted HOURS and HOURS to my site and to learning as much as I canâ¦and some days it seems really hard to justify. </p> 
           <p>This post really helpedâ¦and I love the videoâ¦that guy is on fire!</p>

           <p>Corbett dude, I seriously appreciate every single fucking post you have put up here. In the past few weeks I have been having some doubts since I started doing something that is somewhat foreign territory to me and this post and video tore me apart, opened me up, slapped the hell out of me, closed me up and kicked me into the streets of my mind and Iâm insanely motivated. </p> 
           <p>All I can say is thanks for being awesome and a serious fucking motivator. If youâre ever roaming NYC and Iâm out Iâd be more than happy to buy you a beer for the words dude!</p>

           <p>Awesome kick in the butt. Thanks Drill Sargeant!! Gonna cut and paste this above my desk! Glad you got in #6. Stepping away from the computer is important too, and easy to forget when youâre just telling yourself to GET MOTIVATED. And okay, I guess Iâll actually turn them the fuck OFF (instead of just minimizing the social network/email window â which doesnât really work.)</p>

           <p>Here are some hacks I use to motivate myself:</p> 
           <p> I set the alarm in my phone to ring with a song that motivates me and that is loud enough to wake me up, I change this every week so my body doesnât learn to ignore it (usually from Disturbed)</p> 
           <p> I jump out of bed and do some jumping while singing the song so I will not go back to bed</p> 
           <p> I drink water from a bottle I leave in my room while reading some instructions for the day in my mirror<br> <a href="http://www.thebravemanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2011-11-09_08-05-12_623.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebravemanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2011-11-09_08-05-12_623.jpg</a></p> 
           <p> Then I read my goals that I have in my chalk board:<br> <a href="http://www.thebravemanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2011-11-09_08-05-30_726.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebravemanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2011-11-09_08-05-30_726.jpg</a></p> 
           <p> I work out</p> 
           <p> I do breakfast while letting my body to cool down</p> 
           <p> then I get prepared to get to work and take off while listening to music that motivates me to set the pace of the day</p> 
           <p> When Iâm feeling weak and want to fail I remember myself how it felt when I failed previous challenges because I gave up and how I felt when I achieve something great and remind me that I donât want to feel that failure again in my life (something we did in boxing training)</p> 
           <p> I support it with music that motivates me (I always carry my headphones with me)</p> 
           <p> At night I take 30 min to disconnect with everything and I meditate to remember the things that I have to do the next day, but most importantly, the attitude that I have to keep during the day and when doing the challenges, how do I have to react when feeling weak and what do I have to do in difficult moments (much like shadow boxing)</p> 
           <p>I hope this can help somebody :D</p>

           <p>âFailure isnât the only punishment for laziness, there is also the success of othersâ </p> 
           <p>Thank you for this post â tomorrow the chair is gone, Iâm on my toes! (Standing whilst working is my favourite tip!)</p>

           <p>Thanks for kickâ¦ guess we all need it sometime.</p> 
           <p>I personally use the Pomodoro technique and it helps me get started. I also find automation helps get rid of the procrastination a fair bit. I create a lot of content (and that sure needs a lot motivation) but I have found using voice recognition tools make it a lot easier/faster than having to type it all up manually.</p>

           <p>I got to about point 7 and am waiting for the espresso machine to warm up for my shot. I gues down weeks are not the best time to give up the one coffee a day habit. I love coffee smell and the luxury of the little ritual. I have never (!!) given my e-mail to a sign up list THAT fast. I had barely opened your page. But today is one of those days and your opening line somehow got me. I arrived via a google search âfeeling aliveâ .. In case you wonder. OK. espresso and then some action. This miserable week (ok itâs a month) needs a drop kickâ¦. THANK YOU. I have a feeling youâll be my new best imaginary friend!</p>

           <p>Thanks Corbett<br> I really needed that.<br> The 2 things I loved the most were:</p> 
           <p>1.The quote: âWe all face obstacles. How you deal with those obstacles defines who you are and determines how successful you are in life.â<br> Itâs well known and I think itâs true. Itâs so clever in its simplicity. And itâs a good reminder as weâre often forgetting that everyoneâs facing the same obstacles</p> 
           <p>3.Garyâs video.<br> That guy is an energy bomb and he always gets to motivate me. Iâve read both his books and his first one, âCrash it!â was a true motivator for me.</p> 
           <p>Iâm adding your post to my secret motivational arsenalâ¦</p>

           <p>I will have you know that I have been putting off getting my room/office/car cleaned and organized forâ¦..months. As soon as I finished reading this blog post, I got my room/office/car cleaned, started my laundry, cooked supper, emptied the dishwasher, and cleaned the floors. All in one day! I feel a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for yelling and swearing at me. It was exactly what I needed!</p>

           <p>And so I stumble in to this page at the break point of the term, when the stress and tiredness and the almost impossible urge to whine is floating in the air of my studio.

           <p>Hey, I must say that this is something really motivating. I am myself a blogger who writes on making yourself for better and happy life. I have never read a post with such enthusiasm. The way you âshoutedâ, was brilliant, it gives a blow to me. Although I would suggest you to create a podcast or an audio file on this topic. It would really get 100% of the effect.</p> 
           <p>It made me to write another post on motivation and developing interest in ourselves. Language is rough, but I guess that is essence of this post. I wrote to developing positive attitude if you may wanna check at <a href="http://better-being.blogspot.in/2012/11/want-to-be-tension-free-lets-be-positive.html" rel="nofollow">http://better-being.blogspot.in/2012/11/want-to-be-tension-free-lets-be-positive.html</a><br> The matter, although, is not as motivating as yours.</p> 
           <p>Keep writing! :)</p>

           <p>This post reminds me of a ted talk by a woman (I canât remember her name) who talks about the amount of energy needed to get up in the morning, out of a warm bed into a cold, dark room. She called it âactivation energyâ and it was a powerful analogy to what is required to getting any kind of thing done. I think this post helps push people out of that warm bed. Great work!<br> Alex</p>

I donât have to struggle to find motivation, because itâs right in front of me as I start each day. Thank you so much for the passion and energy you put into this post. It has changed my life, not exaggerating at all.</p>

           <p>Thank you so much! I sometimes slip due to PTSD (stress) from marine corps combat and even the smallest of tasks can sometimes be overwhelming. Today was one of those daysâ¦ I motivated myself up enough to look on the web for motivation and cans across your post.. Thanks!<br> (By the way the cursing did not in any way affect the positivity in your post). Kick ass man</p>

           <p>This is a very, very intelligent guy. He also has more energy(if he worked 15 hr days for 7 yrs!!!) than 98% of us will ever have. Im sorry to say, most of us cannot replicate what he did. Why? Thats the problem-There are soooo many reasons. What if his passion was fruit loops instead of wine? Would he ever in 1000 yrs be offered a tv show for it. Yet this guy is worth listening to. </p> 
           <p>As far as building brand equity, some of us arent creative enough to think of a name for a slice of Pizza let alone a whole company model. And what about shy people? Are they just f-cked from the beginning or should they just do another Anthony Robbins firewalk? Im just playing devils advocate here guys.</p>

           <p>Iâm 28 years old, married with a child on the way. I have a great wife, family and friends. Iâm self employed for a couple of years now in my profession of eight years. My income is probably slightly below the wage of an average person. For years â as long as I can remember â Iâve never had any REAL desire. Any REAL ambition. School never meant much to me. I never aimed for A grades; I was happy with C grades. I was always more interested in doing stuff that I didnât need to do. My employed life has been the same. I do just enough to get by and pay the bills, and thatâs it. But up until recently, something has changed.</p> 
           <p>For the past few months Iâve been experiencing something strange. Itâs like a burning desire inside my chest to become someone, I mean REALLY someone. And it just wonât go away. As a matter of fact, itâs growing. Itâs like I need to put that old person behind me, surround myself with the greatest, most inspirational people this world has ever seen and heard and be like them. And it makes me want much more than what I have right now. </p> 
           <p>In my new-found quest to succeed, I need constant reminders of where I want to be. I struggle with procrastination â no doubt the major factor as to why Iâve had this âclose enough is good enoughâ attitude for all these years â which is how I came across this post. Thank you for the words of motivation. You have inspired me to push myself one more rung up the ladder towards my goal of wealth, recognition, or whatever it is Iâm looking for. </p> 
           <p>I will be somebody. It may not be tomorrow. It may not be in my current profession. But MARK MY WORDS: one day people will know my name, and I will become an inspiration to others as others have been to me. Here I come.</p>

           <p>Itâs so easy to lose focus and encounter adversity. I normally find that Iâll be rolling along for about 3 months and then I lose steam. Itâs sort of my pattern. But reading this post again when I hit that snag will definitely be the kick in the arse that I need! Brutally honest and motivating. Thanks for the great read!</p>

             <p>I know this feeling.. when youâre so sick of or unconfident about the task that you feel actual revulsion and it kicks in after only a few seconds of trying to work on it.</p> 
             <p>Only thing that works for me is to break the task into TINY pieces and find something fun that I really want to do, that can also be broken into tiny pieces. Every tiny goal accomplished in the task (add one slide to my talk, write a single paragraph of this document, whatever) I get to do a tiny bit of the fun thing (5 moves in this turn based game, one page of what I was reading, etc). </p> 
             <p>Itâs a bit extreme but it gets you past the initial psychological hump because you know youâll only be working on it for the next minute or so. And then once youâve got properly started and can see the shape of the solution, the task usually seems less horrible.</p>

             <p>Iâve been working on the to do list for the last 4- 5 years of my life. I feel you. I have to grasp for any small glimmer of value to posts like this though because I desperately need to make moves. But the problem is I just canât be bothered. I find every excuse not to do it, create fake problems where there are none to lose myself in the solution rather than just biting the bullet. I feel like Iâm unequipped to deal with mundane every day obligations simply because I know theyâre required of me. Iâm so lazy its exhausting. Why should I do all of these things if I could just not do them and still be in about the same position as before! Why havenât I done them already and been in a better place a log time ago? I often wonder, âis this really the shit successful people did to get that way or am I gonna be a martyr? Passâ</p>

             <p>I understand what your saying, and half the time I canât get motivated no matter what and the other half I do get motivated, its like I need someone to come over and make me do it then I get so into it and get shit done, I do understand and itâs very hard to do and some donât know how it feels or how bad it stinks to be like that so they just run their mouths and criticize people like you or I.</p>

           <p>:) its not that bad Flannigan. I just feel that internet and reading posts sometimes, keeps one in the loop, instead taking action. !! You shift from one post to another, just to look for motivation, and 2 hrs are gone.!! Its important to take action, even when you are not motivated!</p>

           <p>Right now, I went through a whole loop of unmotivated life, and I actually felt that I need to get SHIT done!! My business failedâ¦. but myself didnât want to study.. I felt this GIANT WALL surrounding meâ¦ BUT NOW! IM THROUGH WITH IS UNMOTIVATIONAL BULLSHIT! This post helped me feel more assured. seems like some people are not, but feeling motivation by these type of post, I think its really up to how fucked up you think you are, and now you feel like you need to get the FUCK UP! and DO SOMETHING!! JUST DO IT! Do it and do it and do it. I be back when I make a lot of money. stereo typical? NO. I want to make so much that would make me SICK!<br> The things that I hated doing, procrastinated, things, I feel like these things are just steps for me to DO ThIS!!! PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE MEâ¦ WAKE UP. please just WAKE UP and look around. and realize there is REALLY nothing you CANT do.<br> I love you world, Im ready to get out and make shit happen!<br> I wish best of luck to you all.</p>

           <p>Awesome, thanks so much for writing and sharing this!! :) I was doing all the things you mention near the beginning: âDo you want to get off your ass and start producing instead of wallowing in despair, depression, self pity, fear, doubt or whatever is holding you back?â I was doing all of those things, Lol I needed a boot camp drill sargeant to give me a swift kick in the ass, and this did it! Thanks so much again for this motivation; I feel like I can do anything now!! :D</p>

           <p>Great article! I wasnât expecting anything I found on the first page of google to actually get me motivated but this officially has. After an entire Saturday of procrastination, Iâm finally starting to do some work at 9 pm. I know itâs not much but itâs better than nothing and has changed my mindset that will affect my studying for the next few days. Thanks guys! Also â great typography. Could almost hear someone shouting at me at some points which was strangely necessary </p>

           <p>Iâve been looking for comedians on YouTube for the past couple of nights, I think we all know a good laugh is good for us but you had me laughing way harder that Dana Carvey, Dave Chappelle or Robin Williams. I have to admit Jim Carey did make me laugh harder, but your damn funny. Nice article with some great ideas!</p>

           <p>My favorite is âquit bitching about how tired you areâ. This is an excuse that I come across over and over from readers who come to my website. âItâs too much work, itâs boring, Iâm exhausted from day jobâ. Well, unless you want to be exhausted forever, start working NOW to get away from that lifestyle ASAP! Excellent article!</p>

           <p>Astrology Answers</p> 
           <p>February 04 2014</p> 
           <p>LOVE COMPATIBILITY TEST: TOP SIGNS YOU HAVE A SOUL CONNECTION</p> 
           <p>Astrology is a wonderful thing, is it not? The gifts from the universe that include the planets and the zodiac signs and all of the beautiful qualities and themes of the constellations in the sky are miracles in themselves. And if you ask me, if the gifts of the universe were left at *just that*, Iâd still be one happy girl. But the universe is, well, the universe, and all of the gifts that it has to offer are as big as it gets. It is physically impossible for any one person or being to know what each and every one of those gifts is, thatâs the beauty of its mystery as well. But once in a while we discover an element of the universe that reveals one of those little secrets. And thatâs exactly what I am going to talk about today. This is a secret from the universe that has little to do with star signs or planets and horoscope compatibility because it is an element that is left entirely up toâ¦.destiny. Thatâs why, every time I say, if you are feeling like you are âfailingâ any of our horoscope compatibility checks based on your star sign alone, fret not because destiny has something great in store for you that goesâ¦even beyond the stars. And that my friends is the destiny of love compatibility that you created for yourself eons and eons ago. I know it is something many of you wonder about, and I know this because I answer your questions on this very topic every single day. The topic of soul connections. Of course, every individualâs path is unique and individual, so I donât have ALL of the answers to every single secret that each and every single one of you hold. But I do know some tips that can help you answer your own questions. Questions like, should I stay or should I go, is she my soul connection, and when am I going to meet Him. Many of you have heard me answer, sounds like you have âall the symptomsâ. What do I mean by that? This is the love compatibility test we are going to explore in depth, today. Are you ready? Letâs get to it.The Definition of a Soul Connection</p> 
           <p>As I have previously discussed, there are many different words and terms for soul connections. Here is a general stream of consciousness on this very topic on how soul connections are formed, to help you determine the differences between these terms for the purpose of this discussion alone. I do need to tell you there are MANY streams of consciousness on the origin and meaning of soul connections, and we at Astrology Answers respect them all. This particular one is one that experts such as astrologer and psychic Silvia Browne and psychic Edgar Cayce subscribe to. A lot of people believe in these tenets and it is these tenets on which I am basing todayâs discussion on soul connections.</p> 
           <p>The origin of soul mates goes back to the beginning of time. At the beginning of time when it was your turn to create your karmic path and your karmic destiny, you chose a Cabinet of people to do so with. That was your first task. With those people you created the blueprint of your destiny that would basically map out exactly what was going to happen to you from lifetime to lifetime. You find those details written on your birth chart or astrological chart. The people you planned that with were your soul connections. Also included in this Cabinet are the legions of angels you have chosen to take this journey with you. Psychics like Sylvia Brown have been quoted as saying the approximate number of angels around you from lifetime to lifetime varies between 60 and 80. So if you think your same sex best friend is a soul connection that you met 7 lifetimes ago, you are probably right. People donât just put that in their head for nothing. But this is a soul connection, someone that is in that wide circle of your initial Cabinet. Every soul in that circle is a soul connection.</p> 
           <p>The next term we define out of that circle are soul mates. These are romantic connections that you preplanned, and romantic connections only. This is where the streams of consciousness begin to diverge and create separate theories, one of them including an entirely separate romantic connection known as the twin flame. For the purpose of THIS discussion, I am going to stop where the different theories diverge, and use the terms soul mates and twin flame interchangeably. So this answers two more of your questions. Can I have more than one soul connection? Absolutely. Can I have more than one romantic soul mate? My answer is no, when we are using the terms soul mate and twin flame interchangeably, and hereâs why.</p> 
           <p>The soul mate and twin flame experience occurred at this origin of time, when you were mapping out your destiny. Your own individual soul split into two, one a masculine energy and one a feminine energy. Those two souls became whole individual souls, but they are âmirrorâ or âtwinâ energies. Thatâs why you canât have more than one twin flame or soul mate connection. You may have other soul connections in your life right now if you are very lucky. But you might not. So this is why you hear people saying, he is the yin to my yang, or she completes me. Meeting a twin flame or soul mate is literally like meeting the male or female half of you. And it is not gender or heterosexual specific, it is about energy patterns. I know a specific twin flame experience where the woman is the masculine energy and the male brings the feminine energy and they are beautiful together.</p> 
           <p>So I know there are often confusions about these terms, I did want to clarify that. So this article can also be called, signs you have a twin flame, signs you have a soul mate, and the like. The wide circle of soul connections is as Oprah would say, a whole other show. So letâs get down to the brass tax of it all!Top Signs You Have a Soul Mate</p> 
           <p>Romantic connection. You are attracted to each other, you canât keep your hands off each other, even when you are apart. This answers the question for those of you asking, âI have been best friends with this guy for years but cant stand the thought of kissing him, but also canât shake heâs a soul connection.â Yes he would be a soul connection but not a soul mate, or twin flame. The passion between the two of you is karmic, tantric, and unlike anything youâve ever experienced. If you need to ask yourself if it is hot enough, itâs not. The word twin flame has heat in the term itself.</p> 
           <p>Instant knowing. From the second you meet them you feel like youâve known each other for lifetimes. People spend their entire lives being bitter bananas in love, until the universe sends them their twin flame. âI now believe in love at first sightâ are things you will hear when someone meets their twin flame. It doesnât happen often, which is why when it happens, it literally knocks you off your feet. I know of a girl that was going on her 40th blind date in a row and told her friend, âIf he doesnât speak of Plato before the entrees are served I am never dating anyone ever againâ. Her girlfriend laughed and told her to lower her expectations. You can imagine her surprise then when her date asked her over appetizers if her spiritual path included any tenets from Platoâs form and function theory. This instant knowing is not something you can plan or create. Remember, itâs pre-destined.</p> 
           <p>Telepathic connection. Soul mates and twin flames have a very similar unconscious, they are identical in fact but for the exception of the masculine and feminine energies. So when they hurt, you feel it. This is what stops you from lighting into them when you are angry, because you will literally feel their pain. But when they rejoice you also feel it, and this is what makes the connection so awesome. So if you find yourself literally feeling something your partner is going through, itâs a good sign of a twin flame connection. You know what they are thinking before they say it out loud. Itâs often âEasy Silenceâ between you two because you are already in each otherâs heads, whether you realize it or not. This is a bitter sweet one for those that are excited about this one. You donât always want to be in their head either, for reasons already mentioned. Everything they feel, you feel, and vice versa.</p> 
           <p>Dreams. Someone will start appearing in your dreams, to announce their arrival, to indicate their current presence. This is a very common pathway of communication for twin flames and soul mates.</p> 
           <p>Synchronicities. Synchronicities are meaningful coincidences, a term coined by psychologist Carl Jung. The Plato example I mentioned above is a good example of a synchronicity. An event that happens that makes you go, âWhat are the chances that would happen on a first date?â Those are synchronicities. I always joke with my friends when they ask about those events happening, âYour angels are playing tricks on you, yes it means something, they are trying to tell you something, pay attention.â When a lot of synchronicities happen about one person, and seem to happen more and more often the closer you get, your angels are offering you peace that this is the one. Other signs are 11:11, a very common message from the angels that you are in twin flame energy.</p> 
           <p>Frequent Breakups or Frequent Distance. Yep, I said it. If you are breaking up and coming back to each other a LOT, it might be a twin flame union. Or, if you are separated by distance that is the same thing. If you find you keep going back and forth with each other or distance is keeping you separated right now, itâs a very good sign of a twin flame union. Thereâs a reason being together isnât working for you guys, and until you pass those tests, things are going to stay this way. Look for the patterns, your angels are trying to point you towards the test you need to learn here. What can YOU change to break those pattern or cose those distance gaps? Remember that both of you have different lessons, so your patterns are the only thing you can clean up. Once you both commit to those clean ups, the breakups become less frequent. And never worry if your twin flame will or will not come back to you. It is predestined, so the answer will always be yes, IF it is a soul mate or twin flame union.</p> 
           <p>Situational Awareness. This is the military term for the actual occurrence that happens when you physically feel your soul mate when they are not around. As I said there are frequent breakups and distance, and this sign is very important. There will be more times than not when your twin is not around, so this symptom is the one sign that will give you hope and keep you going during those times. It feels like having your back to the door and feeling someone enter the room, but nobodyâs there. If you have ever felt like that, you are not going crazy. Your twin is probably thinking of you, reading some of your messages, or planning something with you. Often times you will get a call or a message from them shortly after experiencing this. Yes itâs weird, but if you are feeling it, donât negate it. It is one of the bittersweet blessings of the union because of course it makes you miss them even more. When it happens, recognize it and honor it and send gratitude for it, and these experiences will crop up even more. And as creepy as it can feel, the silver lining is you get to know exactly when your twin is missing you too.</p> 
           <p>Mirror Lessons. Most of the time both twins have the very same lessons in life. So for example if you are guilty and insecure and have problems with the truth, your twin does as well. So if it seems like you both are dealing with the same garbage issues over, and over, and over again, thatâs why. You may learn them together you may learn them apart, but you both will need to learn them until the final stage of your union and purpose completes. So if youâre too shy to call him, and the type to get mad if he doesnât call you, guess what heâs probably upset about? Heâs shy too and too shy to call because you havenât given him enough green lights to do it. As I said, you will be telepathic with each other and through the journey together will become in sync with these issues as you go along.</p> 
           <p>Unconditional Love. This is not just a, I love you, to your boyfriend at appropriate times kind of love. This is a love that jumps in front of a bus for a person you just met that brought up Plato at dinner. You donât know why, but you would rather die than hurt that person, and you will run after anybody who does as well. It is unconditional. This person could actually be the most toxic person in your life right now if they are in a different stage of their journey, but you wonât hurt them. At any cost.</p> 
           <p>Push and Pull. This is the bittersweet agony slash bliss of the soul mate and twin flame connection. One minute you are throwing dishes at them telling them you are finally done, the next you are having the most intense makeup sex youâve ever had and youâve forgotten every mean thing you just spent hours saying to each other. Or, when you are apart, you wake up one morning and send them a message lighting into them for being so inconsiderate, but are calling them an hour later to apologize for your more psychotic moments of missing them. Psychics and astrologers refer to this as the âpush and pull effectâ and something we look for when asked about soul mates and soul connections. Intense to say the least.</p> 
           <p>And there you have it folks. A love compatibility check from the perspective of the soul connection. I know you still have questions so, bring them on. This time when you are telling me about your romantic connection, donât tell me your star signs alone. I want to help you understand your love compatibility from the soul perspective for this exercise, and want you to focus on your feelings alone. I also need to add a word of caution if this exercise leaves you with more questions than answers. Maybe you didnât check anything off this love compatibility test at all. Maybe youâre freaking out and thinking youâre not with The One you think you need to be with, and that you are wasting your time because The One is âon its wayâ. Shake those thoughts out of your head right now. If you are in a romantic experience and it is full with love and you are happy, this is a blessing many reading this would give their left arm for. Keep it, cherish it, nourish it, you are being asked to continue fueling unconditional love through this specific relationship. Maybe you are with your soul connection and I just havenât listed any âsymptomsâ that apply to you. And maybe you are not. Itâs not the worst thing in the world to be in love and in happy and it not be a soul connection. As we have learned, those connections can be extremely painful. The one thing you can guarantee for sure is that no matter WHAT your soul connection destiny is for you in this lifetime, it is destined. Meaning, no matter what your experience is right now, it is going to happen. You chose that long ago. So sometimes when those things arenât happening in our lives right now, our test is to appreciate the lesson that IS in our life path right now and make the most of those tests and challenges. And that my friends, is how lessons turn into blessinâs.</p>

           <p>Thanks to the second quote by Richard Bach, I have now acquired the secret to immortality â laziness. Either that or in a twisted dark way heâs saying âAs your final reward for all your hard work and completing all your missions in life, the universe has decided to give you a prize. Death.â Reading this article is silly for me, because truth be told, right now I canât imagine any activity or turn of fate actually changing my life in a truly positive way. So if I canât even improve my own life by my own efforts in my own imagination, than how the heck could I do it in reality? I guess if you canât escape the Hell inside your head, you canât find Heaven on Earth. Funny that I have the motivation to whine here. You might wonder why I would waste time on this instead of doing what I came here to find the motivation to do and I know why. Itâs because this comment is literally more rewarding than anything else I can do right now. This might seem downright sad, but itâs true, because why else would I waste a half hour typing and rewriting this thing? I could draw, I could write, I could try and solve the most advanced mathematical problems in the known world, but all of it would be more lonely and ultimately more fruitless and futile than a petty online commentâ¦ one that might not even make it past moderation. I now feel satisfied with it, however, so now I will be rewarded by clicking that delightful little post button, a cheap reward for a cheap effort. The laziness of the internet saves the night once again.</p>

What did this help me achieve? Iâm a food blogger and needed to make a butternut squash recipe and take pictures of it. Itâs sounds so dumb but I had been avoiding it for days and just didnât want to do it. No, not the butternut squash! Ok I see this sounds ridiculous, haha. But itâs done finally!</p>
