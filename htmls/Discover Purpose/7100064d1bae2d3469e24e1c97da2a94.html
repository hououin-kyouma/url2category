             <span><p>Although the holiday of Ash Wednesday is never directly mentioned in the Bible, it is one of the most celebrated Christian events in church history. Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent, a 40 day season of fasting, reflection, and remembrance before the Holy Week and resurrection of Jesus on Easter Sunday. In churches on Ash Wednesday a minister recites Genesis 3:19 "for dust you are and to dust you shall return" - while applying ashes in the shape of a cross on the recipient's forehead. While the Catholic church traditionally carries on the tradition of Ash Wednesday, many other Christian denominations and evangelicals have begun to use this day to mark a time to remember how short life is and to begin preparing for Jesus's death, burial and resurrection. Read these Bible verses and Scriptures to grow your faith this Ash Wednesday.</p> <p>Learn more about the history and traditions behind Ash Wedesday at Crosswalk.com - <a href="http://www.crosswalk.com/faith/spiritual-life/what-is-ash-wednesday.html">What is Ash Wednesday?</a></p></span>

Dedicating your child to God shows that recognize your child as a gift from God and you are dedicating yourself to being a godly example to your child. Baby dedication does not secure salvation, rather it is a symbolic moment of entrusting the child's life to God's will. The below Bible verses help celebrate the joyous moments of birth and parenting. The Scriptures can also be using for reading at a baby dedication ceremony to speak God's truths and promises over the life of the precious child!</span>

We lose confidence in trusting God and begin to trust in ourselves and what we can accomplish. Pride and arrogance takes over quick and we find ourselves forgetting the goodness and grace of God.

It is important for us however, to remember that they are just humans too. Remember that our number one enemy is Satan. He takes form in many ways, and is everywhere in the world today- we cannot let him lead us to commit such sins. We must forgive and bless each other, and turn to God to strengthen our will against Satan.Turn to these Bible verses on enemies to help understand.</span>

God is the ultimate judge and when we seek revenge, we are taking His place. When we become overwhelmed with what others have done wrong, we become filled with anger and find ourselves focused on hate. God's love and forgiveness is seen in our ability to love and forgive.

There are several helpful examples of those who took their life and many reminders of hope throughout Scripture. Even though these stories from the Bible are of people overwhelmed by fear, guilt, heartache, illness, pride, disillusionment and hopelessness, no where in God's Word does it indicate that suicide is an unforgivable sin.

           <div class="row"> 
            <div class="col-xs-12"> 
             <span><p>As the popularity of tattoos continues to increase, many Christians wonder what the Bible has to say about tattoos. The short answer is, nothing, at least nothing definitive. The Bible makes no specific reference to tattoos as we understand them in modern times. Some Christians condemn all tattooing as immoral because God clearly forbids them in Leviticus 19:28. Since the word tattoo does appear in this verse in some popular English translations, this argument seems straightforward. For example, the NIV reads, “Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the Lord.” </p> <p>Leviticus 19:28 literally translates, “And a cutting for the dead you will not make in your flesh; and writing marks you will not make on you; I am the Lord.” The word writing refers to inscribed or engraved symbols/words, and is used only here. The word for marks, also used here alone, has an uncertain root, so we’re not really sure what the word means. Further, the word tattoo did not enter into the English language until the late 1700s. This is probably why the KJV, written in the early 1600s, is closer to the literal translation saying, “ye shall not...print marks upon you.” </p> <p> The background to this law was that Israel, after being rescued from slavery, was between Egypt and Canaan. Recent archeology indicates that, while Egypt did tattoo, it was limited to women. Evidence suggests that tattooing the body parts of women associated with fertility (breasts, thighs and abdomen) was believed to be a good luck charm to protect the birthing process. In Canaan, evidence indicates that instead of marking the body with ink, more extreme scarification measures, like branding, slashing or gashing the skin were used. Archeology, backed by biblical texts, indicates the Canaanites would customarily slash their bodies for ritualistic purposes (1 Kings 18:28), especially to mourn their dead and honor their gods. Leviticus 19:28 seems to imply this when it says, “you will not make cuttings in your flesh, for the dead, nor print marks on you.” In light of this information from Egypt and Canaan, it would seem God was forbidding scarification, not tattooing as we know it. (excerpt from <a href="http://www.crosswalk.com/family/singles/is-it-biblical-for-christians-to-get-tattoos.html"> 7 Questions to Answer When Considering a Tattoo"</a>, Crosswalk.com.)</p> <p>With this said, while there may be no clear passage in the Bible addressing tattoos, this is hardly a license for unrestrained tattooing. You still need to think before you ink, especially if you’re a Christian. The following Bible verses that can apply to getting a tattoo are guiding questions to help you think through your decision. Study the Bible, pray and ask God for wisdom, and seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p> </span>

             <span><p>The definition of compassion is a feeling of deep sympathy and sorrow for another who is hurting, in pain, or has misfortune and is accompanied by a strong desire to help the suffering. Jesus Christ is the greatest example of someone with true compassion. Not only did Jesus have compassion and heal people from physical suffering, he also showed the greatest compassion for mankind when died on the cross for our sins.</p> <p>It's not always easy to show compassion, especially when we feel like the person deserves their misfortune. These Bible verses about compassion teach us that it is a true mark of Christian character. Another great example of someone showing compassion and grace is that of the prodigal son. Read the Scripture below that includes how the father showed compassion on his son. Go and do likewise so that you can show the world how Jesus has changed you! </p> </span>

             <span><p>Communion began on the annual celebration of Passover when Jesus told his disciples to remember his sacrifice as they ate the bread and drank the wine. Just as Israel was celebrated the sacrifice of the Passover lamb when the angel of death passed over their homes, so believers in Jesus celebrate and remember his sacrifice of our sins when he died on the cross. </p> <p>Holy communion uses bread as a symbol of his body and wine as a symbol of his blood. The act of taking communion does not save us, it is an act of worship and remembrance. Many churches and denominations have different views of communion, and hopefully these Bible verses about communion will help you decide for yourself how to best observe and remember Christ's sacrifice.</p></span>

             <span>After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples, friends, and others. Forty days after his body was resurrected, Jesus and His disciples went up to Mount Olivet where Jesus promised them that the Holy Spirit would come to give them strength and power in being witnesses to all nations for God's glory. After saying these things, Jesus ascended into heaven, meaning a literal bodily return to heaven. Many onlookers saw and bore witness on that day of Jesus's ascension. As a cloud began to hid Jesus as he ascended, two angels appeared to the disciples and promised that Christ would "come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."</span>

             <span><p>God's Word makes it very clear that there is evil in the world today and we are in a battle for our souls. Revelation 12:12 says "says, "Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short." For this reason, Paul urges us to "put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes"</p><p>Paul goes on to encourage us to not fear evil because Jesus has already overcome Satan and the world. Let's stand strong then with the full armor of God so that we are able to defeat Satan's attempts to destroy us.

Love began with God when he created the world and us. Without Him, there would be no love in the world because it came from Him.<br> 2. God's primary nature is to love as shown by His rescue plan for us through His Son Jesus Christ. The cross of Jesus is the greatest demonstration of God's love for us.<br> 3. God's saving work of grace in the heart of the sinner is the true source of love. God sent his Holy Spirit to us to transform us and make us new in love.<br> 4.

             <span><p><strong>Bible Verses About Lent</strong> - The time of Lent developed as part of the historical Christian calendar and is typically celebrated by Catholics and some mainline Protestant churches that follow a liturgical calendar. Although its format has varied throughout the centuries and throughout different cultures, the basic concept remains the same: to open our hearts to God's refining grace through prayer, confession, fasting, and almsgiving as we anticipate Holy Week. Lent traditionally lasts forty days, modeled after Christ's forty day fast in the desert, and ends on Good Friday. In the Western Church, Lent officially begins with a reminder of our mortality on Ash Wednesday (this year, falling on March 1st). </p> <p>The below scriptures will help you focus on repentance and reflection during the season of Lent. Use this time to grow in your faith as you think upon all that Jesus Christ has done for you!</p> <p>Read the history and traditions behind Lent included when and how it started, and how many Christians celebrate it today - <a href="http://www.crosswalk.com/faith/spiritual-life/lent-101-honoring-the-sacrifice-of-jesus-1382259.html">What is Lent?</a></p> <p> Use our <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/topical-verses/">Bible verses by topic</a> page to quickly find scriptures about popular topics. </p></span>

             <span><p>The most common translation of "repent" is "turn" or "return". Two requisites of repentance included in sub are "to turn from evil, and to turn to the good." Most critical theologically is the idea of returning to God, or turning away from evil. If one turns away from God, apostasy is indicated. Three times Ezekiel included God's call to the people of Israel: "Repent! Turn from your idols and renounce all your detestable practices!" "Repent! Turn away from all your offenses", "Turn! Turn from your evil ways". Such a call was characteristic of the prophets.</p> <p>Confession of sins is both commanded and frequently illustrated. When one is guilty of various sins, "he must confess in what way he has sinned" in order to receive atonement and forgiveness. Thus, confession belongs to repentance, and is needed for divine forgiveness. A great prophecy/ promise is given in the Book of Isaiah: "The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who repent of their sins".</p> <p>In the New Testament, the key term for repentance is metanoia - It has two usual senses: a "change of mind" and "regret/remorse." In both books of Mark and Matthew Jesus began his public proclamation with the call "Repent." In addition, Paul is said to have preached to both Jews and Gentiles/Greeks to "turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus"</p> 
              <prepentance is only a condition of salvation and not its meritorious ground. the motives for repentance are chiefly found in goodness god, divine love, pleading desire to have sinners saved, inevitable consequences sin, universal demands gospel, hope spiritual life membership kingdom heaven.<> 
               <p>True repentance leads a person to say, "I have sinned" and prove it with a 180-degree change of their direction.<br> Repentance requires true brokenness.<br> Repentance is NOT asking the Lord for forgiveness with the intent to sin again.<br> Repentance is an honest, regretful acknowledgement of sin with commitment to change.<br> Repentance leads us to cultivate godliness while eradicating habits that lead into sin.</p> 
               <p><strong>A Prayer for Daily Repentance</strong><br> <em>Dear Lord, thank you for your forgiveness. Thank you for not abandoning us to our mistakes, but for reaching out instead to bring us home. Help convict me of sin and help me accept your mercy without shame. Thank you for the love you have poured out for me and all of your children. Help me live out of that love today. In Jesus' Name, Amen.</em></p>

             <span><p>As tattoos grow in popularity each year, it makes sense that most Christians wonder what the Bible has to say about tattoos. The short answer is that the Bible does not say anything clear and direct about tattoos. Many use Leviticus 19:28 as an argument against tattoos. This verse literally translates: "And a cutting for the dead you will not make in your flesh; and writing marks you will not make on you; I am the Lord.” The word writing refers to inscribed or engraved symbols/words, and is used only here. The word for marks, also used here alone, has an uncertain root, so we’re not really sure what the word means. Further, the word tattoo did not enter into the English language until the late 1700s. This is probably why the KJV, written in the early 1600s, is closer to the literal translation saying, “ye shall not...print marks upon you.” </p> <p>The background to this law was that Israel, after being rescued from slavery, was between Egypt and Canaan. Recent archeology indicates that, while Egypt did tattoo, it was limited to women. Evidence suggests that tattooing the body parts of women associated with fertility (breasts, thighs and abdomen) was believed to be a good luck charm to protect the birthing process. In Canaan, evidence indicates that instead of marking the body with ink, more extreme scarification measures, like branding, slashing or gashing the skin were used. Archeology, backed by biblical texts, indicates the Canaanites would customarily slash their bodies for ritualistic purposes (1 Kings 18:28), especially to mourn their dead and honor their gods. Leviticus 19:28 seems to imply this when it says, “you will not make cuttings in your flesh, for the dead, nor print marks on you.”</p> <p> In light of this information from Egypt and Canaan, it would seem God was forbidding scarification, not tattooing as we know it. With this said, while there may be no clear passage in the Bible addressing tattoos, this is hardly a license for unrestrained tattooing. You still need to think before you ink, especially if you’re a Christian. The following Bible verses should help you make a decision on your tattoo and your walk with Christ.</p> <p>Read through <a href="http://www.crosswalk.com/newsletters-only/today-on-crosswalk/is-it-biblical-for-christians-to-get-tattoos.html">7 Questions to Consider Before Getting a Tattoo</a> to further guide your decision making on tattoos. </p></span>
