The following <a href="http://www.roger-waters.com/candle.html">explanation for this song</a> appears at Mr. Waters' web site..."The first verse of "Each Small Candle" was written by a South American who'd been a victim of torture. An Italian journalist, active in the initiative against torture in Northern Italy, had given Waters the short poem years ago. The poem lay in a drawer in Waters' studio until, during the crisis in Kosovo, he read a piece in The London Times describing a Serbian soldier who saw an Albanian woman lying in a burned-out building. The soldier left his platoon to give aid to the woman, then rejoined his men and marched off. <a href="http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/rp/poems/dickn9c.html">The image</a> inspired Waters to set the short poem, "Each Small Candle," to music and pen additional lyrics." The song begins, "Not the torturer will scare me Nor the body's final fall Nor the barrels of death's rifles Nor the shadows on the wall Nor the night when to the ground The last dim star of pain, is held But the <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/142/83.html">blind indifference</a> Of a merciless unfeeling world..."</b> </p>
