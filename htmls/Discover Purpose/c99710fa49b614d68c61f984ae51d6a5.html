We may also ask to see a copy of your driver’s license or other identifying documents. In accordance with federal regulations, until it is activated and registered, a prepaid debit card is subject to an initial load limitation, may not be used for international transactions or account-to-account transfers, or be reloaded.</p>

     </dt> 
     <dd> 
      <p>Yes, you may use your Purpose Card to pay at the pump. However, paying at the pump may cause a hold of up to $75 on your account until the final amount is processed. Since this can sometimes be a few days later, we recommend that you consider paying inside to avoid this hold instead.</p>

     </dt> 
     <dd> 
      <p>Yes, you can use your card at car rental agencies that accept prepaid cards. However, they usually require a deposit of 15 percent more than the cost of renting the car. The rental agency will put an extra hold on the account for that amount of money and the hold could last for a couple of weeks. We suggest that you call the car rental agency to inquire about how much they require for a standard deposit if paying with a prepaid card and how long a typical authorization hold on a prepaid card will last. </p>

     <dd> 
      <p>It depends on the merchant. When you use your card at hotels and restaurants, or at other service-oriented merchants, it’s called an "open ended" transaction. That means the total amount due is unknown. The merchant has the right to estimate the final transaction amount. If this occurs, and the total amount authorized by the merchant exceeds the amount available on your Purpose Card, the transaction will be declined. The merchant also has the right to hold funds on your Purpose Card. In order to avoid these types of holds, we recommend you call hotels first to inquire about their prepaid card policy.</p>

To participate in the Savings Account program, Cardholder must consent to and continue receiving communications from us in electronic form. If Cardholder is subject to Internal Revenue Service backup withholding at the time of the request to open a Savings Account, the request will be declined. Interest is calculated on the Average Daily Balance(s) of the Savings Account and is paid quarterly. </p> 
      <p class="legal" style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; padding: 0 15px;"> • If the Average Daily Balance is <strong>$1,000.00 or less</strong>, the interest rate paid on the entire balance will be 4.91% with an annual percentage yield (APY) of 5.00%.<br> • If the Average Daily Balance is <strong>more than $1,000.00</strong>, the interest rate paid on the portion of the Average Daily Balance which exceeds $1,000.00 will be 0.49% with an APY of 0.50%, and the interest paid on the portion of the Average Daily Balance which is $1,000.00 or less will be 4.91%.

These are promotional rates and may change without notice pursuant to applicable law. No minimum balance necessary to open Savings Account or obtain the yield(s). Because Savings Account funds are withdrawn through the Card Account (maximum 6 such transfers per calendar month), Card Account transaction fees could reduce the interest earned on the Savings Account. Card Account and Savings Account funds are FDIC-insured through MetaBank, Member FDIC upon verification of Cardholder's identity. For purposes of FDIC coverage limit, all funds held on deposit by the Cardholder at MetaBank will be aggregated up to the coverage limit, currently $250,000.00. </p>
