The constellation of the goddess Ophiuchus, the snake handler, can clearly be seen emerging from Scorpio and leaping up to Vega. Astronomers recognize her. She is one of the eponymous (original) signs on the sun’s ecliptic, based on the 28 day, 13-month lunar calendar. Each of the 13 signs has a different size share of the 360 degree ecliptic, their natural portions. Ptolemy and the Romans kicked her out of the Zodiac in 118 ACE.

        <p>For a long time I was engaged with karma astrology, being sure to find an answer to the question: what for I was born and why I have all that that I inherit in this life. An attempt to answer these questions has resulted in a professional work not only in an astrological area, but also in other directions of mysticism. Modern society dictates the certain conditions of work in different fields of esoteric knowledge. In most cases people are interested in simple every day things such as money, love affaires, household, and personal things, but in my opinion it is necessary to look wider and search for something interesting in more serious aspects of live.</p> 
        <p>The main activity in mysticism to my mind is improvement of vital activity system of a human being. The basic astrological direction, which I see as perspective for improvement of energy of the world, is a choice of the correct period of conception of the future child and the help to a women who experience difficulties with conception, through drawing up a calendar of conception containing optimum dates for conception. It will show you the most probable time for conception and a right choice of childbirth date. You can always order such a calendar with a comment of a natal cards just calling or sending me an E-mail.</p> 
        <p>Next important direction in astrology is prevention of accidents and improvement of karmodial conditions. The main thing is to warn people about forthcoming misfortune so that a man is ready to work with adverse concatenation of circumstances if they can be seen-through a man’s birthchart. These are adverse prospects in different aspects of live, including personal security.</p> 
        <p>The third crucial factor that determines actual condition of karma and destiny is amulets. Amulets and things bearing protective power and correctly charged can not only remove negative influences of other systems but also transfer a correct, constructive pulse of protecting power field and destiny.</p> 
        <p>Everyone who wishes to take advantage of this service can order a special amulet as the Egyptian cross, and also as an open palm. Amulets of a dragon play special role in this question. Stylization is also an important question in a choice of the amulet. It’s one of serious medallions with the dragon image that I want to call your attention to. There is a particular stone in the centre of a medallion that suits its owner. There are used both precious and ornamental stones.</p> 
        <p>Amulets are made of silver and gold and go through a special ritual of purifying and charging against certain energetic parameters. A jeweler makes them in a certain day and time, chosen according to an astrological card of a customer.</p> 
        <p>Economy studies allow me to carry out astrological researches and give you a professional advise in different modern business activities at a highly professional level. A significant part of business world is still under strong influence of stars that is proven by astrological researches in fields of macro economy, business administration, the finance, and also management and marketing. Most of things that happen in the world of money are indicatively determined by stars in the sky and secrets of a human embodiment.</p> 
        <p>On the basis of the conducted researches in an astrology and collected knowledge in the world of business I’ve issued a training course of a business astrology that I’m pleased to offer to your attention. It’s purposed for those who fancies himself an astrologist in the world of business and wants to receive astrological fundamentals of business and the theory of money. You’re welcomed to pass through a training course at my school of business astrology.</p> 
        <p>The system of images and symbols has the big value in any human’s life. In esoteric creativity I find painting an opportunity to display all scale of existence and to penetrate into meditations in essence of a question, which is represented on a canvas or on paper. I invite you to see your present, past and future in pictures made according to my sketches. Those who closely read my secret forecasts, can understand, that space hides sometimes the information about our past, present and future. It’s intended for those people who are ready to meet and to look into the unknown.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.findastrologer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wp37ad2567_05.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-927" src="https://www.findastrologer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wp37ad2567_05-200x300.jpg" alt="wp37ad2567_05" width="100" height="150"></a>Time and again, metaphysics has played an important part in Ray’s existence and life’s experience. “My Spiritual knowing helps me to strip away all the excess so I see my life at its most basic,” Ray confesses. “Like a caterpillar creates a cocoon to transform itself into a butterfly, so I use metaphysics and spirituality to reinvent myself.”</p> 
        <p>Ray uses his spiritual and metaphysical knowing as a sort of guidepost on his journey through life. By understanding planetary energy and the aspects of planetary placement in the heavens, and our connection to Spirit, he is able to look into the past at the choices he made that were not necessarily choices that served him, understand why he made the choices he did, and understand what he could do to create a different situation for himself – a different life – that he might not have considered before but, he discovered, could serve him better and allow him to gain deeper insight into himself. He could more clearly discern opportunities – choices – ahead of him and then choose the path more befitting the individual he wanted to become.</p> 
        <p>By October of 2003, radio stations around the world were inviting Ray to be their guest, and he soon began guest appearances on various morning news and lifestyle television programs! And, in 2004, Ray ventured into another medium–print–with his writing appearing in consumer periodicals, including Dell Horoscope and other Spiritual and Metaphysical publications.</p> 
        <p>Ray has been heard in Cork, Ireland (on RedFM 104-106), London, England (BBC 94.9 FM), and across the United States. Since January 2006, he has appeared as a regular guest on the “Frank DeCaro Show” on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. His television appearances have included syndicated morning lifestyle shows such as “Daytime” and “Better TV,” and the popular New Jersey cable TV show “One On One with Steve Adubato.”</p> 
        <p>On why he enjoys radio and television interviews: “What I do is what I love to do, and having the opportunity to interact with others while sharing my expertise on such a grand scale is exciting and fulfilling.” Though Ray is often asked to discuss predictions ranging in topics from celebrities to political figures to the state of economy, he is most gratified to be able to impress on audiences how “Spirituality is really a means to help on one’s path through life.”</p> 
        <p>Ray’s web site continues to grow in popularity as the number of visitors frequenting the site each month rises. The visitors hail from places as close as his hometown to as far away as Australia. He’s able to provide frequent updates on astrological forecasts for the Full and New Moon. He also charts any current planetary movement, such as the Mercury retrograde. You can even check out the site to learn when he will next be a featured guest expert on a radio or television show!</p> 
        <p>Since going full time in his metaphysical and spiritual profession, he is no longer bogged down by the mental strain of work politics. In fact, Ray has become even more intuitive. His mind has opened and he is more receptive to messages given to him from the universe. Although he was aware of Spirit energy, specifically of those who have transitioned into the Spirit Realm since a very, very young age, Ray had not completely sharpened his ability to interact with those who have departed the physical realm and have transitioned into Spirit. Once he began delving into his metaphysical profession on a full-time basis, the spectral doors opened wide, and the lines of communication became abundantly clear. At this point, Ray was being invited into private homes, as well as public establishments, where he conducts his psychic/gallery events.</p> 
        <p>When asked how he came to write his book, The Planets Align so Rare: Twelve Dimensions to the Human Potential, Ray explained, “I was in a place of a high spirit vibration when Spirit bestowed upon me the inspiration for this book. This revelation came to me in part because of my desire to create something that would influence humanity through the realization of the human potential, which resides in each and every human being.”</p> 
        <p>In 2009, Ray became ordained and is now “Rev. Ray!” He performs and conducts non-denominational and spiritual wedding and funeral services.</p> 
        <p>Ray Sette makes his home in a quiet New Jersey town outside New York City. For more information about Ray, please visit his web site at www.astrologerray.com.</p>

After receiving his Master’s, he also received post-graduate training in Jungian theory and practice. After extensive social service experience in the fields of mental health, drug and alcohol treatment, domestic violence, and child abuse, he began working in private practice as a therapist and counselor, with an emphasis in family and relationship counseling. While he continues to practice as a therapist his practice is primarily in astrology specializing in individual, family, and relationship astrological counseling as well as in the fields of relocation, electional, and vocational astrology. His love of education and teaching began very early in life, so it is a great joy to be able to extend this love into the field of astrology. The philosophy of his School reflects the notion that astrology provides a model that allows a person to discover their own uniqueness and is a tool that enables one to become self-aware in a meaningful and profound way. He shares the view of Richard Tarnas that “astrology is archetypally predictive, not concretely predictive.” This viewpoint changes the way one thinks of the individual in relation to the Cosmos for we see that as we become more conscious, we become free to aspire to manifest the highest potential manifestation of the archetypal complex that is our birth chart. This is how we can move beyond the deterministic way astrology has often been used. The value of going beyond this way of approaching astrology is that it can enable the mind to cross over from a ‘dis’-enchanted soulless universe to one full of profound meaning and purpose. The classes of the School stress an interactive approach that encourages the student to discover ever-deeper ways in which astrology can describe the nature of the archetypal energies of their natal chart. We can then see that transits and progression reflect an unfolding of the potentials of the natal chart and how we can handle and even use these in a more intelligent, expansive, and fulfilling way. The student then is both learning astrology and being transformed by it. The potential depth of these changes can lead to an increase of one’s recognition of oneself as an autonomous being while simultaneously a totally connected participant in the much larger cosmic drama of Life.</p>

        <p>My quest<br> My theological life was an enlightening period in my life. I just did not study theology, but rambled into psychology, mysticism, spirituality, and philanthropy. Every day I learned new things about God and God’s spiritual realm. I understood that thefive planets sitting in my dharma house would never let me to have a desire for worldly pleasures. The planets warn me against superficial relations or worldly desires. The moment I set my eyes on worldly wisdom and pleasures, I am sure my life will go haywire. I have experienced it in my journey of life. I studied ‘The Bible’ from renowned Church leaders for more than 10 years.

When I was introduced to Astrology at a young age, I found that key. The confusion I felt when dealing with a family member that I loved but hadn’t understood in the past was no longer a problem because I had the insight I needed to help me decipher their motivation, emotional expression, and many other traits that eluded me in the past. Knowing Astrology helped me move beyond taking what others said or did personally. And it inspired me to learn from the different people that were in my life. As well as teaching me compassion and to flow with life’s experiences.</p>

When you feel a need for greater clarity or to make changes you can have a Progression which is a look into your future or a Life Purpose Reading or a Career Analysis and instantly see all the opportunities that lay before you! All of us, at one time or another, have needed answers to problems we were grappling with. Astrology is one proven way to discover those answers. An Astrologer can be an advisor throughout life’s journey.<br> I have been an Astrologer and Intuitive for thirty years receiving my certification from the Intellectual Society of Master Astrologers after a four year program. I have also been a certified Flower Essence counselor for twenty five years. I feel privileged to be able to do a work that so excites me and helps others in the process.

Watching the alchemy of astrology transform the lives of my clients and students has been one of my greatest pleasures. I believe that by listening to the wisdom of nature, the “wise stars”, we can align ourselves with our purpose and come to a greater understanding of our place in the universe.</p> 
        <p>I’ve benefited from the astrological wisdom of Steven Forrest (through his astrological apprenticeship program) and also the mentorship of Asata Gabriel, who has taught me over the years with great Aries verve about astrology, intuition and flower essences. My writing has appeared in The Mountain Astrologer, The Llewellyn Books Annuals, Well Being Magazine and Organic Spa Magazine (under the name Heather Vuchinich) and I have an M.A. from Sonoma State University. I’m a member of the San Francisco strological Association and also a founding partner in Galaxy Girls Events.</p> 
        <p>Based out of Fairfax, California, where I live with my fiancee and my dog Sweetie, I do n-person and long-distance readings (via the internet)”</p>

        <p>Ena Stanley has been nominated three times for the Regulus Award in Education. and was the first person to receive NCGR’s Level IV Certification in the field of education. She started her personal study of astrology in 1968 and started her formal study in the late 1970’s with Beverly Farrell, PMAFA. Her education went on through the first half of the 1980’s with several noted astrologers, including intense studies with, Ziporah Dobyns and Joan Negus.</p> 
        <p>In January of 1986, she began her career as a teacher and started her work building a curriculum to accommodate certification programs. She taught at Southern Oregon State College, 1986-1989; College of the Mainland (Galveston County, Texas), 1990-1993; Gulf Coast Chapter – NCGR, 1994-1995; CALCampus, an exclusively on-line community college, January 1995 – Spring, 1997. In July of 1997, she and Ed Perrone created and opened the first cyberspatial astrological school through an experimental contract with NCGR; but upon realizing the broad potential of this medium, they decided not to remain exclusive. Subsequently Online College of Astrology was born.</p> 
        <p>In Spring of 2008, Online College of Astrology, Inc. was dissolved and on March 31, 2008, at 12 noon (Richmond, Virginia), OCA, Corp. became a non-profit corporation. At UAC in Denver of that same year, a meeting was held consisting of staff, faculty and students, past and present. This was a very productive meeting with many discussions that ultimately brought about additional changes, it was noted that the word “online” was appropriate in 1997, but in 2008, it was passé. A contest was organized that fall to select a newer and more appropriate name for our school. The International Academy of Astrology was decided upon.</p>

Over the past decade I have had the honour of consulting with many people, using Astrology, Tasseomancy and the Tarot to help guide and offer insight at times of personal transition. I am genuine about my work, and enjoy it immensely – I consider it to be my specialcalling or vocation in life. All my work is undertaken in an ethical manner and with the utmost honesty and integrity. The results of an astrological consultation are often spookily accurate, and can provide answers to questions (horary), give insights into personality (natal), help you see the direction that your life is heading over the next year (solar return), narrow down the most auspicious time to begin something new (electional astrology) or even provide an indicationof ongoing or upcoming health issues (health analysis). My specialties are: Horary Astrology, Natal Assessment, Vocational/Career, Personalised Forecasting, Relocational Charts.</p> 
        <p>In order for you to get the most out of your consultation with me I encourage you to enter the consultation with an open mind and an open heart. My approach to Astrology has a mythic, psychological, archetypal and traditional perspective rather than a ‘fortune teller’ approach. Due to my background in ritual and ceremony, I am able to assist in the creation of talismans or amulets and isolate magically auspicious times should a client be open to this. It is my intention to provide insightful, accurate and helpful Astrological consults while keeping ‘do no harm’ in mind at all times.

Astrology was my first “fringe” study that opened me up to a world beyond the confines of mainstream thought and religion. I have been studying astrology for nearly 20yrs and practicing professionally for the past 4yrs. I have level I certification through the NCGR (National Council for Geocosmic Research) and professional medieval astrology certification through the New Library-London. I specialize and excel in humanistic &amp; evolutionary astrology. I offer natal chart/life potential (includes current transits and progressions), solar return/year ahead and relationship synastry/compatibility readings. I am first and foremost a “healer” (all healing is self-healing), and I use Astrology as a self-awareness, self-understanding and self-acceptance tool. If received in the proper light and applied to life, Astrology can be a knowledge-stream that helps us to see ourselves more objectively, without unnecessary judgment and criticism, helping us to greater and greater levels of self-acceptance and well-being.</p>
