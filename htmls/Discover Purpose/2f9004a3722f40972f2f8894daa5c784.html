        <p><b><u>Lena suffered from full-blown episodes of all these syndromes.</u></b> </p>
       </center> 
       <p>Some days just getting out of bed seemed too hard and she shut down when it came to making decisions. </p> 
       <p>With so many paths in front of her, she was terrified of taking the wrong one and blowing off the right one. She felt her Life Purpose mastery slipping away from her.</p> 
       <p><b><u>Lena realized, if something didn‘t give, her life would stay exactly where it was!</u></b> </p> 
       <p>After learning about my Life Purpose support, Lena went with her gut and asked for Baeth‘s help. </p> 
       <p>Baeth pulled back the curtain on Lena‘s Life Purpose, which is being a healer that works with other healers, as well as an author and speaker in the spotlight. </p> 
       <p>After hearing this, Lena thought…</p> 
       <p style="font-family: 'playfair'; padding-left: 25px ">… Yeah right! What is this woman talking about?&nbsp;Me? Write a book? Teach? Speak in public?!! So not going to happen. </p> 
       <p> Lena was filled with tons of doubt, but the more the idea bounced around in her head the more it called to her and gave her the courage to follow through. </p>
       <p>Finding her Life Purpose helps her stay focused on her authentic life… allows her to stay on track… and she avoids wasting precious time. </p>
       <p>Lena‘s now written two books. </p>
       <p>She‘s moved past her fear of public speaking and embraced her spotlight by teaching others to live a better life and has over 17,000 fans on Facebook. </p>
       <p>Lena now helps other “helpers” find their message and write books that people want to read! </p>
       <p>Lena knows in her heart, and believes, that trusting in the discovery process with Baeth and focusing on mastering her Life Purpose led to her phenomenal success. </p>
       <p>Is this ringing any bells? </p>

       <p><b><u>And what troubled her most was that she KNEW she was a black-belt — that mastery was and is a part of her path.</u></b> </p> 
       <p>She enjoyed acceptable success in her professional life and loved her work, <b>but there was something holding her back, she was just spinning her wheels.</b></p> 
       <p>Since she was young she knew she was powerful… intuitive… and skillful, but her family environment and conditioning collided… she hid her skills and never brought them out again.</p>
       <p> She went looking for her Life Purpose and found Baeth Davis.</p>
       <p> Baeth shared Lauren‘s Life Purpose and she realized her old beliefs were holding her back! She REQUIRED her hidden skills to grow!</p>
       <p> Now she‘s sharing her intuitive skills with her clients, and her schedule has never been fuller. </p>

       <p><b>Of course, you may have a less ‘action-oriented’ Life Purpose.</b> Your focus might be your inner spiritual pursuits and/or intimate relationships – rather than an outer-focused Life Purpose.</p> 
       <p><b>Your Life Purpose may not require you to be in the public eye. </b>Not all of the Life Purposes do. Following the path of your Life Purpose may demand you spend more time by yourself, perhaps learning about the master path of self-love or finding inner permission to be an out-of-the-box innovator.</p> 
       <p><b>When Lisa discovered that her Life Purpose is the “School of Love,” tears streamed down her face. </b> As a mother of three and twice divorced, Lisa felt a huge sense of relief to discover that her ONLY Life Purpose is LOVE. It helped her understand why relationships were the biggest source of pleasure and pain in her life. </p> 
       <p>This understanding gave her permission to take ownership of her “Love” Life Purpose – a career focus was not a priority. What matters most for Lisa is how she approaches EVERY relationship – with self-love, emotional authenticity and compassion – most importantly, for herself! Cultivating self-love became a CONSCIOUS journey – allowing her to choose more wisely the relationships she wishes to develop and those she wishes to complete and release.</p>

        <p class="p21">Each of your fingerprints has a bit of purpose in them and when your combination is de-coded, it's unique to you.</p> 
        <p class="p21">You might have one Life Purpose and or a mix up of several Life Purposes.</p>

     <p class="p19">I didn't yet know my own Life Purpose and couldn't understand WHY working alone was so devastating</p> 
     <p class="p19">Once I discovered my Life Purpose, I understood I was missing an audience to share my spiritual wisdom with.</p> 
     <p class="p19"><b><u>My insistence on doing it all alone, making all the decisions disappeared after I learned to RECEIVE.</u></b></p> 
     <p class="p19">The ability to RECEIVE was the tipping point in my career, the key to my success.</p> 
     <p class="p19">I have read over 25,000 pairs of hands in my 23 years as a mentor and hand analyst. I know what I'm talking about! And I have written 7 books and created over 60 audios to help inform people about Hand Analysis.</p> 
     <p class="p19">As you probably know, once you've activated your Life Purpose and start following its guidance, you're no longer guessing at the life-defining choices affecting your level of happiness. You know what makes you happy and it shows in all areas of your life!</p> 
     <p class="p19"><b>For example</b>, it's no longer a matter of “How can I make money?”</p> 
     <p class="p20" style="font-weight: 600">It's “<b>What do I love doing that I could offer to others and charge for?</b>”</p>

     <ul style="list-style: disc"> 
      <li>No more questioning what you're supposed to be doing with your creativity or what direction you should head in.</li> 
      <li>Clients MAGNETICALLY come forward and look to you for answers.</li> 
      <li>You no longer make excuses because the answer is right in your hands.</li> 
      <li>Clients pay what you ask… you no longer hesitate, feel awkward or embarrassed about asking for what your worth.</li> 
      <li>Intuitive messages come in and you're no longer afraid to follow up on the guidance you receive.</li> 
      <li>More health, wealth and love FLOW into your life.</li> 
      <li>You unlock your incredible power and start living the life you always wanted.</li> 
      <li>Your creativity is accessed much more easily and being ‘blocked’ becomes something of the past.</li> 
      <li>You DECIDE to achieve MASTERY Over The Course of Your Lifetime and BE a CONTRIBUTION to others.</li>

With the Blueprint and the wonderful journey with Baeth &amp; Pamelah through Purpose Mastery, I got a real “in the bones” understanding of what is meaningful to me in a soul-satisfying way.

        <p>"Hi Baeth, A few years ago you provided me with a Hand Analysis and I just recently listened to the recording again. OMG. I can't begin to tell you how spot on you were (are). Everything you mentioned in the call resonated with me at the time, but since I was in transition and my business was evolving, it is even more clear now just how accurate your analysis was. </p> 
        <p>At the time I was unsure of the direction I should go in my business because I was experiencing an awakening of spiritual gifts and so much was changing in my life. You told me my niche was "women in business who have special needs kids" and that the energy healing work I do would start with the children, and then be transferred to supporting entrepreneurs. </p> 
        <p>I just wanted to tell you that in fact the folks who are seeking me the most for services are mothers of children with autism who are in business for themselves, working as therapists, consultants and coaches for others. </p> 
        <p>You also predicted that I would have books and be known for developing this work, and I wanted to share that the story I told you on the audio file is one of the stories I have shared in a book describing some of my spiritual awakening. </p> 
        <p>The book is "Finding Fulfillment in the Spiritual Age", edited by Sheri Keys and Sheldon Ginsberg. </p> 
        <p>You also mentioned that one of my gifts was being able to see the 'hidden players' and use of visual communication. I channel images of energy fields and use them to show before and after effects of the work I do with my clients. </p> 
        <p> Because of your clarity and insight I have a greater understanding of how I make the invisible visible and can support my clients to understand issues of a spiritual nature for deeper healing. Thanks so much for that! xo” </p>

        <p>“I have been on a journey to find my soul's purpose for most of my adult life. </p> 
        <p>I moved around all over the U.S., trying to discover what I'm supposed to do “when I grow up”. </p> 
        <p>I've had many jobs just to “make ends meet,” but never a career. When I was 30, I decided to go back to school and get my degree, so I could go out and get “a real job” in the professional world. I put myself through college and got my undergraduate degree, but couldn't find a job in my field. Defeated, I took up a job in a health food store chain, once again, to make ends meet. </p> 
        <p>I very quickly rose to department manager and was making more money, but felt completely unfulfilled. </p> 
        <p>I searched for answers online and stumbled across Baeth Davis's life purpose website. After attending one of Baeth's intimate workshops, I <i>finally</i> discovered what I came here to do. I am meant to help other successful, entrepreneurial women find a spiritual meaning and purpose to their soul-sucking corporate jobs through luxury travel. </p> 
        <p>I discovered what I am meant to do is what I've always loved doing!</p> 
        <p>I have FINALLY discovered my life's purpose!”</p>
