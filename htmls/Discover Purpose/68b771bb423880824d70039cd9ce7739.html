I preferred to listen rather than to speak; to inquire, not crusade. As a noncombatant, I was welcomed at the tables of even bitterly divided foes. I came to recognize that I had my own compass and my own convictions, and if, at times, they took me in circles, at least they expanded outward. I had no wish for converts-where would I lead them? – Ted Gup, This I Believe</span>

Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and expose the country to danger. It works the same in every country. - Herman Goring, Nazi leader (though I disagree with him, he reveals the reality of political power over the masses)</span>
