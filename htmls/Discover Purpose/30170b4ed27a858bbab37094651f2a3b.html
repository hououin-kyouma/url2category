Baghoomian, Doctor of Metaphysical Sciences, D.Ms.</strong><br> In 1980, I earned my Diploma from The Armenian Catholicos (Universal Church) of the Great House of Cilicia in Beirut, Lebanon. In my twenties, I became very attached to the studies in humanities: religion, philosophy, metaphysics, history, literature, poetry, art, music, paintings, psychology and politics. <br> The curriculum in the academic circles could not provide answers to the on-going ontological, epistemological, teleological, and especially, metaphysical questions. <br> It has taken more than thirty years of self-introspection, meditation and self-study courses (i.e.; Great Books of the Western World) that have blossomed into a mature understanding of the self, the nature of the soul, the nature of God, the nature of spirit, ourselves as humans and the cosmos at large. <br> I&#x2019;m thankful to both UMS in California and UMS in Minnesota for having provided me with the opportunity to voice my thoughts in the domain of metaphysics so crucial especially in the New Age where humanity is faced with many challenges in their pursuit for spiritual growth, peace, love and happiness.<br> <br> <strong>Sharon Nitka, Philosopher of Metaphysics.

Ever since I have attended the UMS since August of 2008, you all have taught me that there is no fear in the balance of giving and receiving, only unconditional love." </font></font></em><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#330099" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#x2014; </font><font color="#330099">R.B., UMS Student</font></font></p> <p align="center"><img src="/Art/Pictures/NewPics/purple_rainbow.jpg" alt="metaphysics" width="169" height="231"></p> <p align="center"><em><font color="#330099" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm approaching to the end of the curriculum for my bachelor's,&nbsp; and I'm impressed by all the knowledge I've gained during this time.
