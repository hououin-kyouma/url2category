           <p>After years of being neglected by all the "Find Your True Work"-oriented books, courses, and career counselors, we "Renaissance souls" now seem to have an embarrassment of riches. I read this book and Barbara Sher's "Refuse to Choose" in succession. Both are well worth reading, and, while I prefer Sher's book for several reasons, I strongly urge anyone who recognizes themselves as a "Renaissance soul" to read both books. Lobenstine has had a typical "Renaissance soul" career herself, as well as working with many others, so she's able to recount many encouraging and helpful anecdotes. For those of us who have grown frustrated with the "follow your passion" approach to career planning because we can't pin ourselves down to only one passion, it's great to know that we're not alone. And as her title implies, throughout much of human history, having multiple interests was considered an asset rather than a sign of "immaturity" or "inability to focus." Her exercises (especially the "values" one) are very useful for self-understanding. She offers good advice about how to use your various skills and interests in the work world -- by finding (or creating) an "umbrella" job that covers a range of interests, or by being a serial monogamist in several fields, or by taking a J.O.B. that enables you to further your passions without locking you into an uncongenial career path. Finally, she provides a helpful reading list (although, having read many of the books on it, I've learned that most of them promote a "follow your bliss" viewpoint that assumes that everyone has a single passion in life). I have some quibbles: 1. Lobenstine seems to feel that all "Renaissance souls" are fundamentally alike, so they'll all find the same type(s) of job congenial. (Sher does better with this.) 2. Expecting your family to support your unconventional approach to jobs may or may not work, depending on your family. (My parents adhered to the Depression-era ethic of Never Quit a Good Job, Even If It's Destroying Your Soul -- which, by the way, literally killed my father -- so for me to expect their support would have been an exercise in frustration.) 3. The "reverse flow chart" approach was, as far as I'm aware, first laid out by Barbar Sher in *Wishcraft* in the 1980's. While Lobenstine mentions the book, she doesn't credit Sher specifically for this exercise. It's probably an innocent oversight, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. </p>

           <p>"Renaissance Souls love nothing better than to take on a new problem or situation and then dig into...until we master the challenge we've set for ourselves. And then, with fresh enthusiasm, we move on to another passion. We are lucky people who, if left to our own devices, are never bored for long." - Margaret Lobenstine Do you resist confining yourself to just one hobby or career? Are bookstore and libraries candy stores to you? Do friends suggest that you become a contestant on game shows because you know "something about everything"? Are you capable of becoming passionately excited about a wide variety of subjects? Do you find yourself interrupting yourself, dropping one task to pick up another before it's done? If any of these descriptions sound like you, then you're probably a Renaissance Soul. Unlike the Mozarts of the world who always knew what they wanted to do in life or enjoyed sticking to one discipline, Renaissance Souls are the Ben Franklins of the world. That is, we have many concurrent interests and the idea of settling on "just one" (or even two) makes us nervous and nauseous. Most of the world operates on the idea that "settling on a career" or "getting focused" by steadily climbing the corporate ladder over decades is the "right"-and secure-way to live. However, for a Renaissance Soul to attempt to squeeze in such a confining mindset is almost like a living death. Despite a long, proud history of inventiveness and cultural influence among the ranks of Renaissance Souls, parents, teachers, and the social climate at large insist that we are somehow defective. This often leaves us feeling discouraged, frustrated, and confused. Why are we like this? Why can't we be "normal", and limit our passions, hobbies, and career endeavors to "just one"? Fortunately for us, author and life-coach Margaret Lobenstine has written a book especially for Renaissance Souls, offering encouragement, validation, and practical tools for living a fulfilling, joyful life. The Renaissance Soul: Life Design for People with Too Many Passions to Pick Just One is an incredible resource that explains the difference between choice and focus, shows how to thrive on many interests without feeling scattered, and equips individuals with powerful life-design strategies. Lobenstine also illustrates how Renaissance Souls can transform a day job so that it carries dreams forward, learn a new field without going back to school, and get paid for your passions. However, even if money isn't your goal and you just want to be able to explore, engage, and enjoy your multitude of interests, the author provides wonderful exercises for getting the most out of your pursuits. The section called The Ice-Cream Sampler alone is worth the price of the book! Lobenstine-also a Renaissance Soul-can sympathize with the dilemma that "choosing has often meant losing". However, she helps her fellow Renaissance Souls learn an invaluable tool called Focal Point Strategy. By using the analogy of sampling dozens of ice cream flavors "four flavors at a time", the author demonstrates the mechanics and benefits of focusing your interests. Focusing, she asserts, brings more, not less, to a world of possibilities-offering variety with clarity and concentration. She writes: "I can't emphasize enough what a powerful difference it makes in a Renaissance Soul's life to feel free to focus on three or four or five things for now, and let others wait until later. We simply can't juggle dozens of interests at once. And yet, there is a kind of abundance that flows from establishing a tighter focus." As one who has had many interests throughout life-some of which I've explored in depth for years-I'm all too familiar with having *so* many interests, that paralysis sets in when trying to decide what to do next. I've been a minister, a teacher, a counselor, an interior decorator, a credit solicitor, a webmaster, and free-lance writer. I'm a stay at home Mom who home schools, am a professional Tarot reader, and pursue many intellectual and spiritual interests on the side. I was surprised and comforted to learn that there are many people out there like me and we have a name: Renaissance Souls. Another invaluable tool from the book is the "Five from Fifty" exercise where you decide your five main values right now. According to Lobenstine: "People who aren't fully committed to the values that their activities represent sputter through life, pulled in one direction by their commitments and in another by their spirits." Not only does she show Renaissance Souls how to choose their five most important values, but she also demonstrates how to run activities through the filter of "Whose values are these? Mine or someone else's?" One of my personal study projects, lasting years, has been personality systems. One of these systems-the Enneagram-demonizes Type 7's for not focusing, claiming that we have a multitude of interests because we're trying to run from or hide extreme emotional pain. Hogwash! I bought that silly lie for several years and finally realized it just isn't true. A Type 7's salvation isn't being like a Type 5, hunkering down and choosing "just one" focus to exhaust ad infinitum until we transform ourselves into a boring, single-minded geek. I came across The Renaissance Soul: Life Design for People with Too Many Passions to Pick Just One quite by accident while in large chain bookstore. In fact, I was on my way out of the bathroom-heading towards the coffee counter before leaving-when I saw this book on a display. After I read the dust jacket, I KNEW this was a book written for people just like me...and bought it immediately. While the entire book is a gold mine for Renaissance Souls, the Focal Point Strategy has been invaluable for me. I now realize that I can pursue all my interests-just not all at once. This strategy has freed up amazing amounts of time and energy, helping me to get the most out of what I've chosen to do and curing me of "analysis paralysis". If you're a Renaissance Soul or a Type 7 in the Enneagram, this book is an incredible resource for staying on track, sucking the marrow out of life (and your interests), using your unique personality to your advantage, and celebrating the spirit of the Renaissance Soul. -- Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot </p>

           <p>Are you one of those people with a large and shifting set of interests? Never quite took to heart those well-meaning admonitions to settle down and focus on one thing? Now you can shuck the dilettante label and become, in Margaret Lobenstine's inspired phrase, a Renaissance Soul. She's written a terrific book, practical, useful, easy to read. It identifies and serves people who refuse to be slotted by what they do to pick up a paycheck. After reassuring us that it's not aberrant or self-destructive to be among the multi-focused, Lobenstine shows us how to hone our many interests into four or so major Focal Points. But which four? you ask. Use the Ice Cream Sampler exercise to get past the fear of making forever commitments or the overwhelmed feeling that you have too many options. Once you've identified your Focal Point pursuits, Lobenstine shows you how to link up with people who can help you move forward. She's especially good on turning your day job from a soul-numbing slog into a springboard to advance your interests, and on networking your way to the knowledge you need to pursue your passions. The book lays out proven techniques for organizing your time and juggling multiple interests. I particularly liked the reverse flowchart, which disassembles potentially overwhelming goals - starting an import/export business, for example - into smaller, actionable steps. The chapter devoted to younger Renaissance Souls contains useful ideas on managing college course loads and breaking into the work world. The final chapters include a sensitive look at psychological obstacles that can slow us up, and strategies for climbing over these self-created walls. Margaret Lobenstine is the new patron saint of those whose life jounney compels them to wander down many different paths. </p>

           <p>Do you dream of being a successful teacher, writer, world traveler, and parent, all at the same time? Maybe you dream of being an artist and an organic farmer? If you are having trouble figuring out how to wear all the hats of your interests and remain productive, happy and sane - then this book is for you. Although you will find a few soul-searching exercises in Margaret Lobenstine's book, you will find much more practical advice and concrete examples of how to start living a life of many passions without feeling overwhelmed. My personal favorite from this book has to do with focal point calendar blocks, where you block out a set amount of time each week on your calendar to do one of your *focal points*, or current passions that you are focusing on. This blocked out time is not specifically assigned to any project -- you choose which project to work based on how you feel at that time. What a freeing thought! You don't have to work on project A right now if project B is calling. Each project gets worked on in due time, and each gets the proper amount of energy from you that it deserves. This is just one of many easily applicable bits of advice you will find in this book. I also do recommend that you read Barbara Sher's book *Refuse to Choose* on this same topic. Barbara's book does have many soul-searching exercises that complement the practical advice in Margaret Lobenstine's book. </p>

           <p>This is a book that is definitely geared toward those in the market for answers. While the author provides good information and some of the exercises were helpful, I felt the anecdotes became tedious as did her spectrum markers of Mozart and Ben Franklin. A lot of her work is an adaptation of Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity (GTD) principles (which are themselves consolidations of other work). For example, what Lobenstine calls "intention markers," GTDers will know as "next actions." The "Focal Points Worksheet" serves the same purpose as GTD's "Weekly Review" I do think it will be a helpful book for anyone feeling guilty about having multiple career paths or life goals...or for those who just don't know what it is they want to do. Lobenstine's "PRISM Test" is a good basic set of questions to ask oneself when embarking upon a professional or personal goal: Price, Reality, Integrity, Specificity, and Measurability. The basic point of the book is to free "Renaissance Souls" from the fetters of career rigidity. </p>

           <p>I have spent quite some time trying to decide on one "forever" career and pick between my numerous intrests and hobbies becasue I just didn't have time for them all. I have read several standard time management books, and set up SMART goals and five year plans, only to change my mind or be unable to follow through till the end, mostly because I either lost interest or couldn't imagine doing this thing or that "forever." The last few months I have been unable to do much of anything; I have finally earned my Master's and have tons of new-found spare time, but couldn't decide what to fill it with, mostly because there were so many interesting things to fill it with! So I had been stuck in indecision and been extremely "unproductive." Then I found this book!!! This book has been helpful in so many ways, none the least because I finally know there isn't anything wrong with me! There are plenty of others like me who have so many interests that we just don't know where to begin. If this sounds like you, I would highly reccommend this book. Everything else I have to say has been covered by other reviewers, but I do want to add that after figuring out my focal points, I have been able to come up with much more creative and enjoyable ways of meeting my goals then I ever did trying to make everything a SMART goal. Enjoy- I did! </p>

           <p>Anyone who has three books going at the same time, who hates the thought of constraining him- or herself to just one "thing," or who gets swallowed up for hours in a bookstore will find themselves in this book. Lobenstine does an excellent job of describing the "renaissance" personality and helping people who fall in this category to accept and embrace their "diagnosis." She offers concrete ways of working with -- instead of against -- our personality traits. I love feeling like I'm not alone, and I appreciated some of the concrete suggestions, but I finished this book feeling a little lost as to what my next steps should be. How do I select my four (or five) focal areas when it's nearly impossible for me to choose ANYTHING? I would have appreciated a more structured approach to winnowing -- rather than narrowing -- my choices. Overall, though, full of tons of great inspiration, if a little light on the practical side. </p>

           <p>This is a must-read for anyone who thinks they may be a renaissance soul, and possibly even if you're not! It answered all the questions I had about my future, and now, rather than dreading it, I'm actually looking forward to the many exciting experiences and opportunities it will bring. Margaret offers many creative tips and tools for pursuing all our interests, and getting where we want to be, while remaining focused and energised. She likens the renaissance soul's interests to an ice cream shop full of hundreds of flavours. It's so hard to choose: they'll either close before you finally pick one, or else you'll get sick trying them all. Yet, if the shop offered a four-flavour sampler, and you could mix and match the flavours every day, it would be no problem. So she suggests that renaissance souls choose four, or at most five, interests to focus on at a particular time, and set up a focal point notebook. One of her tools is called a J-O-B, which is a temporary job or volunteer position that furthers one or more of your focal points. For example, if one of your focal points involves travel, find a job at a place that offers free or discounted airline tickets (perhaps with an airline.) If you want to produce documentaries, perhaps even an entry-level job at a place that deals with video equipment would be helpful. Or if one of them is knitting or sewing or reading, find a job that offers a lot of down-time (a box-office attendant, for example). Or you might choose a job where you could network with the people who could help you further your focal points, or give you recommendations for the position you want. You can feel energised knowing that your J-O-B is furthering your focal points, and if you wish, eventually, making your focal points and your income source one and the same. She offers many other creative tools in this book: advice on how to solve problems when you don't know how to get from A to B, training without going to grad school, finding a career that encompasses all your interests, time management tips geared to renaissance souls, and others that let us pursue our many interests without being condemned to a life of poverty. She offers advice on how to solve problems when you don't know how to get from A to B, how to get training without going to grad school, time management tips for renaissance souls, and many creative ideas for pursuing our many interests while not being condemned to a life of poverty. She offers many real-life examples and role models, which for me was one of the best parts, since there are so few role models in this world for people like us. I've read a couple career-oriented books -- including Barbara Scher's Wishcraft -- but they didn't quite cater to people with more than one single bliss. This is a wonderful and unique book that does just that, and what's more, clearly makes the case that you don't have to choose, and the journey can be FUN! Very good bibliography, too -- I always like that. </p>

           <p>The term "Renaissance Soul" dates back to the 15th and 16th century when the ideal person was expected to have knowledge and skill in many areas. Life Coach Margaret Lobenstine reclaims that idea for today in "The Renaissance Soul: Life Design for People with Too Many Passions to Pick Just One." Renaissance Souls are those whose interests run to many areas. In our world which seems to value specialization above all else, such people can feel lost. The idea of committing to one career path for life, or even five years (think of the ubiquitous 'five year plan' of career manuals) is suffocating. The fear of choosing the wrong path can keep them from making any choice at all. Lobestine asserts, however, that a Renaissance spirit is actually something to be valued and celebrated. She states that "not only do Renaissance Souls have loads of interests; they are often capable of bringing a passionate level of intensity to several of them at once." She suggests that instead of trying to choose one area to focus on, Renaissance Souls should try to choose four. That way, there is enough variety to keep a multi-interest person happy. There is also the opporunity to evolve as a person. If one focal point no longer holds the allure it once did, it can be phased out and another interest put in its place. A Renaissance personality can be both an asset and a challenge in the workplace. In today's ever-changing marketplace, the ability to adapt to change is highly valued. On the other hand, many Renaissance Souls find that they function better as entrepreneurs in charge of their own destinies. Others find they do best disassociating themselves from what they do for a living and insteading concentrating on their focal points as outside interests. Lobenstine also suggests ways for Renaissance Souls to make the most of their day jobs or volunteer opportunities, using them as a steeping stone to greater opportunities in a career one can love. "The Renaissance Soul" is a very useful book for well-rounded people who have difficulty fitting into the single-focus structure the world seems to expect.

           <p>I really enjoyed this book. It is well written and the exercises are valuable. I usually cringe when I have a book I cannot just read through, but the exercises were easy to do and were progressive and logical. I found the exercises about creating four focal points for your life was very valuable. I have used this exercise to narrow down the things in my life that are important to me now. Having many interests, I decided to go after my MBA. The school I go to has a flexible MBA and an Executive MBA - and as a typical renaissance soul, I picked the flexible MBA program. Another focal point is incorporating exercise in my life. The third is to become a great public speaker - and I joined Toastmasters and am taking a class this summer. My fourth focal point is to get back into my music - as a singer, guitarist and learn piano. Now in these four focal areas there are lots of subsets, so four seemed to me like a reasonable number to excel at. It is important not to think you have ADHD or that something is wrong with you. Margaret points out that Ben Franklin was a renaissance soul and that Mozart was his antithesis. Mozart knew what he wanted to do from the age of three. Franklin was an inventor, politician, statesman, etc. IN the mid-20th century being a renaissance type peson sort of lost its glow and everyone has been taught to pick one thing for a living and be happy with it. For renaissance souls, this is not acceptable. In this day of rapid changes in the world and in businesses, there are lots of opportunities for renaissance souls to blossom. I urge everyone to read it, even if you are not a renaissance soul. It will help you understand those who are. </p>

           <p>This is a nice piece of work. The book does spend far more time than I wanted justifying the multitude-of-interests person. But it was quick reading at the beginning so not much of a burden. There are some exceptional insights here, and some wonderful tactics for dealing with your range of interests. The introductory exercises (Five from Fifty = prioritizing, Many Circles = weighting, Birthday Party = accomplishments) can help clarify things for those caught in the mire of doing. Clarifying your interest, no matter how many there are, is an important aspect of this work. I particularly like the idea of Focal Points - temporary assignments you give yourself in order to have the freedom to learn or accomplish. Reverse flowcharts are great in that they force you to see what you are doing that gets in your way. Basically think of how you can ensure something will not happen - there you go, many times that's what you're doing. I think the concept of Four Frames - which is applied to volunteering - can be used in a far greater sense as well. Not simply limited to convincing a potential volunteering opportunity, but if you look at your larger goals, and your place in your journey - this approach can be used to convince your spiritual self what it is you want to contribute, and why that would be a good thing for all. The crux of the entire message of the book is "I'd love to help you feel fulfilled rather than overwhelmed." The author states "Renaissance Souls work best when we can match our activities to our energy flow." I think this is true for everyone, but it isn't something we value in the US all that much (instead we're told to bang our heads for 14 hours and meet that deadline, many times producing a lower quality result). So, without having a specific prescription for each moment of your day, the approach here allows you flexiblity in choice based on your motivations at that time. Yes, balanced planning - I've been waiting for someone else to say it. My favorite story in the entire book is the one on Mozart, and his pursuing his purpose, becoming what he could be in the midst of all else going on. The author weaves an intricate connection about how this benefited so many others than if he were to try and be something he were not. Very nice... "One of the best things you can do for other Renaissance Souls is to keep growing." And I would add, the best thing we can do for all beings. Toward the end of the book I felt the work there was less inspired. It focused on examples, whereas I think a book works much better if at the end it brings us back up to that higher-purpose and leaves us with lofty placement. We end on a real high then. </p>

           <p>For years, I thought I was just a failure. Everyone around me seemed to be able to figure out what they wanted to do with their lives. Why couldn't I? I took every test I could get my hands on. I bought endless books. I started all of them and finished almost none of them. None seemed to resonate. And then a friend mentioned "The Renaissance Soul." I was intrigued, but told myself that I couldn't buy another book, that I'd bought too many and it was folly to buy another. But I read a good sheaf of virtual pages with Amazon's Look Inside! feature, and I was sold. Labels can be limiting, of course, but I'm happy to identify myself as a Renaissance Soul. It's comforting to know that the phenomenon exists, that I am not a lone person who can't seem to find direction, but rather that I am part of a vast community of people who have many interests aren't wired to pursue life in a linear fashion. This book offers camaraderie but also some practical approaches to focusing our energies and interests. I highly recommend it for those who continue to strive to find their place. </p>

           <p>If you are someone with a great many interests, and you have trouble getting them all done (or even worse, becoming stuck and not getting anything done at all), this book provides a good famework, as well as case studies, for approaching these goals in a way that only a renaissance soul could really appreciate. It provides a handflul of exercises, as well as theory and explanations on why are are as we are. The book, as with many books, could have been shorter. The beginning and end are filled with great strategies and information; the dead center/middle is hit-or-miss, oscillating between some useful thoughts-out-loud and some redundant, less-than-important information that read more like filler. Overall, though, I found this bok to be helpful; it provides novel exercises and best practices to get you moving toward change, but doesn't overload you with so much of this stuff that you never take out your notebook to make any notes so it ends all saying right the book instead of in your head, etc. So, I recommend when/if tit slows down for you in the middle, start skim-reading and move towards the end; if that were an official edit of it. It's tough being a renaissance soul; this book is compassionate to that and does its bst to help. Better than most others I have seen the category (it goes more in depth and more creative than simply "do what love; everything else will be okay"--it touches on that but gives realistic paradigms for achieving dreams while having a real life before that happens and, i don't mean just have a day job; she goes beyond that into creative solutions in that regard. Nicely done. </p>

           <p>I absolutely loved this book! I cannot recall any book I have read that I have identified so strongly with. The author's empathy and clarity about the topic was evident throughout the book. Plus, she addressed her readers with respect, realizing they were an intelligent group, and she somehow knew that they needed her to be genuine. I always thought there was something inherently wrong with me because of my insatiable interest in so many things. I need to read the book again and implement the exercises. I also contacted the author (although it was very difficult finding her contact info) because I wanted to see if she still did coaching. I did speak with her and we had a time set for a session. She seemed very nice. Unfortunately, she had a family crisis and said whe was unable to coach me. Not sure if I should contact her again or not. This was months ago all this happened. </p>

I still struggle. But after reading this i understand my problem better, and I have followed (albeit in a fairly slack, lazy fashion) the advice herein, and it has been immensely helpful. I now focus my energy better and make better use of my time and I have stopped panicking on what i'm missing out on or what choice I made that was wrong. I have also been recommending this book to high school kids that sound the same as I did at that age - "I like everything / what if i pick wrong?" Incredibly helpful. </p>

           <p>Renaissance Soul is one of the best how-to/self-awareness books I've read in a long time. Margaret Lobenstine provides clarity for those who have wondered why or worried about having more than one passion, which is contrary to the commonplace but misguided advice to "find your passion". She upends the belief, with specific examples, that everyone has a (one) passion and anyone with more than one is unfocused. The book provides insight into behaviors and motivations of those who identify as a Renaissance Soul. It offers strategies for managing and balancing multiple interests. It helps anyone who reads the book get a better understanding of themselves, loved ones, employees or colleagues. </p>

           <p>Are you a Renaissance Soul? To find out, answer the following questions with a "Yes" or a "No": Do you find a lot of different things interesting/worthwhile? When you really understand how something works, where it fits, &amp;/or how to do it, do you lose interest? Do you hate that there's an expectation for just one answer to the question, "What do you want to do when you grow up?" Do you find it almost impossible to describe what you're going to be doing in 5 years in singular? Do you have a tough time choosing? After a year or two at working in one place, do you get the itch to move on? Answered "Yes" to at least 4 of these questions? Then you're a Renaissance Soul - just like me &amp; a ton of other Creatives! I give The Renassiance Soul: Life Design for People with Too Many Passions to Pick Just One by Margaret Lobenstine an A+ and a smiley face sticker. It was so refreshing to finally find someone who accepts - no, encourages! - those with many passions to incorporate them all into their life on their own terms. That's one of the foundations of my coaching practice, so I obviously ate this book right up, and subsequently have recommended it to almost every one of my creative clients. Ms. Lobenstine starts the book off by acknowledging the fact, from the time we're young, most of us have had the message of "get a stable, steady, singular job" drilled into our heads over &amp; over &amp; over again by our parents, our teachers, our mentors &amp; even our friends. It's the norm, the status quo, the end all &amp; be all to a "successful" life. Even if you come from a family that supports hoofing it to Broadway or opening a virtual store to sell the dog sweaters you knit, there's usually still a voice in our ear telling us to find "something to fall back on" or to "find a plan &amp; stick with it." The consensus is that you'll be a failure if you decide to split your focus, or you don't pursue one straight path. But what if the dog sweater knitter was also a great art teacher? Or loved yoga? Or had a super green thumb? Should she, because she decided to open her own Etsy shop, cut off the other passions in her life? Or should she close up shop &amp; pursue the passion that would provide the biggest, most stable income? The author says, "No", &amp; to that I say, "Amen"! But what rocks is that she doesn't say it in an idealistic way - thus encouraging this particular woman to be a dog sweater knitter/art teacher/yogi/botanist all at the same damn time. Instead, she leads you through exercises to see what you might want to enjoy as a hobby and what you might want to pursue for financial value. She offers time management suggestions, like picking only four Focal Points so you don't get overwhelmed or scattered or bored. She explores many different career options for Creative Souls, like an umbrella job that encompasses your many interests, or two jobs that can be pursued simultaneously but compliment each other. Possible roadblocks are acknowledged (perfectionism anyone?) &amp; then knocked down. There are also exercises for you to differentiate your values to the ones that have been bestowed on you, to set your intentions, to figure out your Focal Points &amp; manage your schedule, etc. </p>

           <p>I recently bought this book because I was laid off in December, and thought this would be a great time to re-think my career path. The problem I've had my whole life, is that I have SO many interests and SO many passions, I' haven't been able to choose just one - this in turn has left me feeling paralyzed and stuck in a stagnant "career" that has nothing to do with what I'm passionate about. At the end of the day I would go home drained of all my energy and unhappy....dreading getting up the next morning and doing it all over again. The good news is that I don't feel alone in this respect any more. I've learned that there are other people out there just like me, who have struggled with education and career direction. This isn't because we are not smart enough or sharp enough or driven enough...but because we want to do it all!!! I'm only about 1/3 of the way through the book, and already I feel relief coming my way! I think this is the book I have been looking for my whole life. Please, do yourself a favor if you feel a lack of direction due to a fear of committing yourself in just ONE direction, and get this book! It focuses on acknowledging what's really important to you, identifying your most important values, addressing financial concerns, time management and so much more. </p>
