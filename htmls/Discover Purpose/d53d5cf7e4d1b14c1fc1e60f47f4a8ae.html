    <h3>Well-being</h3> 
    <p>An excellent survey on the well-being of Plymouth University students and graduates by Dr. Glen Crust and Dr. Helen Hicks found that<strong> students with the highest well-being</strong> were those on medical, nursing, pharmacy and teaching courses whereas <strong>students with the lowest well-being</strong> were those on finance, law, management and economics courses. You can find the full survey results <a href="http://issuu.com/glencrust/docs/graduate_wellbeing_initial_results__8c57ebe7c945bc/1">here</a>. Well-being was measured by amalgamating scores for: "how satisfied you are with your life"; "the extent you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile"; "how happy you felt yesterday" and how anxious you felt yesterday (inverse).</p> 
    <p><strong>Occupations with the highest well-being</strong> included health professionals such as physiotherapists, nurses, midwives, podiatrists and paramedics, further education teachers, surveyors, accountants and management consultants. As you might expect, graduates who got the type of work they wanted were happier than those who only had one job offer which they had to accept.<br> <br> <strong>Graduates with first class degrees </strong> have on average a higher well-being than those with 2:1s, who have a higher well-being than those with 2:2s and thirds. This may well be because graduates with higher degree classes tend to be in better or more appropriate jobs. <strong>Women graduates</strong> report slightly higher levels of well-being on average and <strong>white graduates</strong> were found to have higher well-being scores than Black/African/Caribbean/Black British respondents.</p> 
    <h3><a name="small" id="small"></a>Are employees of small businesses and the self-employed more or less satisfied?</h3> 
    <p>A survey by the TUC found that <strong>employees in small businesses are more satisfied at work</strong>. They were also found to be the most committed and loyal to their organisations. They also felt most engaged by their employer and <strong>had the most freedom to choose their working patterns</strong>. There were far fewer reports of bullying, <strong>lower stress levels</strong> and <strong>less complaints about long working hours</strong>. <br> <br> The Chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses said "In terms of the way they treat their staff, small businesses consistently out perform their bigger competitors. Small business owners know that the greatest asset is their staff and they are more likely to treat them as individuals and recognise their needs. By having a committed and loyal workforce that has a say in how the organisation is run, the smallest business has a bigger advantage."<br> <br> Having said this <strong>larger organisations</strong> do tend to offer higher initial salaries, better training and more chance to specialise. See our page on <a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/sme.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Working in smaller organisations </strong></a></p> 
    <p><strong>People who have set up their own business tend to be happier.</strong> They take responsibility for their own future, and take control of their own destiny. Self employed people are happier about their work-life balance even though they work the longest hours - because they have <strong>more control </strong>over their time.

    <p>Research by Sonya Lyubomirsky (University of California) using data for over 250,000 people found that being happy lead to higher incomes, greater productivity and quality of work, more satisfying and longer marriages, more friends, stronger social support, and richer social interactions, more activity, energy, and <a href="#flow">flow</a>, and better physical health.</p> 
    <p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.006973147316739592">A study in 2007 by <a href="http://www.unisi.it/eventi/happiness/curriculum/nattavudh.pdf">Nattavudh Powdthavee</a></span> found that <strong>meeting regularly with friends, relatives and neighbours had the same effect on your happiness as a large increase in salary</strong>. Being married or living together was also highly beneficial.</p> 
    <h3><a name="commute" id="commute"></a>Commuting<span id="internal-source-marker_0.3"><br> </span> </h3> 
    <p>Some new research by the Office of National Statistics (ONS).has found that people who spend between an hour and 90 minutes getting to work each day are more miserable than their colleagues. and people travelling by bus are even more unhappy.</p> 
    <p>Commuters have on average lower life satisfaction, a lower sense that daily activities are worthwhile, lower levels of happiness and higher anxiety than non-commuters. People who worked from home had higher personal well-being even compared to those who commute for less than a quarter of an hour.</p> 
    <p><a href="http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2014/september/active-commuting-benefits">A study at the University of East Anglia</a> found that most commuters prefer taking public transport to driving due to the stress caused from driving to work. ‘Active commuters’ who switch from driving to work to walking or cycling are under less strain, and therefore perform better in the workplace reinforcing the idea that there are positive psychological effects of exercise, plus the physical health benefits. Lead researcher Adam Martin said: <em>“Commuters reported feeling better when travelling by public transport, compared to driving. You might think that things like disruption to services or crowds of commuters might have been a cause of considerable stress. But as buses or trains also give people time to relax, read, socialise, and there is usually an associated walk to the bus stop or railway station, it appears to cheer people up.”</em></p>

    <h3>The Easterlin Paradox</h3> 
    <p>The economist Richard Easterlin found a paradox: high incomes do correlate with happiness, but <strong>long term, increased income doesn’t correlate with increased happiness. </strong></p> 
    <p>Researchers examined 37 countries over the long term (measurements were made over 22 years) and found that happiness ratings within a country didn't increase with income. In China, S. Korea, and Chile, per capita<strong> income doubled is less than two decades yet all these countries showed slight declines in happiness. </strong><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/12/08/1015962107.full.pdf+html">Easterlin said</a> "We may need to focus policy on urgent personal concerns such as health and family life, rather than on the mere escalation of material goods." </p>

    <p><strong>Money is surprisingly not particularly important once you have enough to meet all your basic requirements. </strong>Extra money doesn't make you much happier. <span id="internal-source-marker_0.">A pay rise does make you happy but only for a short while as you quickly become adapted to it. This</span> is because we rapidly get used to what we have (see the <a href="#hedonic">hedonic treadmill</a> below). </p> 
    <p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.4">In the UK, life satisfaction has decreased since the 1970’s </span>despite a 60% rise in Gross Domestic Product in that time, again showing that buying and <img src="../pics/value-of-something.png" alt="THe value of something" width="491" height="262" align="right">owning consumer goods makes no difference to well being. In <span id="internal-source-marker_0.5">1998 Bhutan allowed in </span>television and the Internet into the country for the first time (previously they had been banned).

    <p>A new job, house or car gives a short term boost, but quickly get accustomed to it. Having your finances under control (e.g. not being in debt) is more important than a large wage, although earning less than most of the people you know also affects your happiness (keeping up with the Joneses). There is a higher occurrence of depression in those who think happiness comes via money, fame, and beauty. People are more motivated by the fear of losing something than the hope of gaining something.</p>

    <h3>Bonuses<a name="bonus" id="bonus"></a></h3> 
    <p><strong>Rewards such as bonuses</strong> provide a short term boost to performance but ultimately <strong>reduce long term motivation</strong>. Performance related pay and the carrot and stick approach have <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/184767769X/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1292324315&amp;sr=1-4">little or no long term value in motivating staff</a>. </p> 
    <p><a href="https://www.i-l-m.com/Why-ILM/Research-reports/Beyond-the-bonus">Research from&nbsp;the Institute of Leadership &amp; Management</a> found that few employees said that bonuses motivated them to work harder.</p> According to those surveyed the most important motivators were: 
    <ul> 
     <li>59% felt <strong>enjoyment of the job</strong> was the most important motivator </li> 
     <li>49% <strong>how much they are paid.</strong></li> 
     <li>42% <strong>getting on with colleagues</strong> was the best motivator</li> 
     <li>22% <strong>being treated fairly by their managers</strong></li> 
     <li>22% <strong>autonomy: how much control they have over their work </strong></li> 
     <li>Only 13% of employees said that <strong>bonuses</strong> motivated them to work harder.</li>

    <p>&nbsp;</p> 
    <p> <strong><a name="feed" id="feed"></a>Getting regular feedback, allowing staff autonomy in their role, the opportunity to innovate and improved office environments</strong> also helped</p> 
    <p> Good managers are key motivators who can make a real difference to their teams. The ‘five fundamentals’ of good management: <strong>coaching, giving feedback, listening, rewarding and recognising success and performance management</strong>. Something as simple as hearing ‘you've done a really good job on ....’ can strongly boost to an employee’s confidence, deliver a sense of pride and satisfaction and encourage them to put more into their work.</p> 
    <p><strong>Part-time workers</strong> are more motivated (76%) at work than full-time workers (68%), despite being paid less pro rata (£10,793 a year, less than half of the average salary for a full time employee at £22,328). They are more likely to have a higher level of respect for their manager (57%) than full time colleagues (52%) and a more positive attitude towards their employer (57%) than full time staff (49%).</p> 
    <p><strong>Women were significantly more motivated than men.</strong><strong> </strong>For women, enjoying their job is the most important motivator (64% chose it as one of their top three), followed by ‘how well I get on with people’ (44%) and base salary (41%), while men chose base salary and benefits (58%) as the most important factor, then enjoying their job (53%) and how well they get on with colleagues (41%).</p> 
    <p><strong>Those under 30 are more financially motivated</strong> than their older colleagues, and are more likely to currently be in a job where they receive financial incentives for work. Some 55% of under 30’s indicated that money was either very or pretty important to them, compared to 43% of over 30’s. 12% of under 30s said that money is the root of all happiness compared to 9% of over 30s.&nbsp;</p> 
    <p>Two thirds (61%) of employees said their workplace had an <strong>appraisal system,</strong> but a quarter of respondents (25%) think that appraisals are performed poorly by their manager. Appraisals are less effective at driving the performance and motivation&nbsp;among female employees.</p> 
    <h2><strong><a name="sensual" id="sensual"></a>Sensory pleasures</strong></h2> 
    <p><strong>Many people confuse happiness with sensual or sensory pleasures:</strong> those obtained from alcohol, food, sex, drugs, money and sun drenched beaches! Sensual pleasures are highly enjoyable whilst they last but tend to be short lived. They are a quick hit. They produce a <strong>temporary, ephemeral lift: instant but transient and superficial gratification.</strong> The high doesn't last and eventually becomes unfulfilling: rather like eating chocolate but nothing else: wonderful at first, but ultimately unsustainable. It has also been called "Hollywood happiness".</p>

    <p><em>“Well," said Pooh, "what I like best," and then he had to stop and think. Because although Eating Honey was a very good thing to do, there was a moment just before you began to eat it which was better than when you were, but he didn't know what it was called.</em></p> 
    <p> The problem with sensual pleasures is something called the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">Hedonic treadmill</a>.</strong> <strong>The high you get via sensual pleasures is produced by dopamine; a brain neurotransmitter associated with addiction</strong>: the pleasure you get is rapid but unfortunately doesn't last long - you <strong>need more and bigger hits to achieve same effect</strong>: more alcohol, drugs or whatever. It's called this because it's similar to a treadmill where you have to keep running just to stay in the same place. If you experience a constant sound, smell or image it eventually disappears from your awareness. <strong>We quickly become familiar with new sources of pleasure and so the pleasure lessens:</strong> enjoyment quickly fades as we get same experience every day. </p> 
    <p><img src="../pics/hedonic-treadmill.JPG" alt="hedonic treadmill" width="366" height="266" hspace="8" align="left"></p> 
    <p>This leads to a <strong>vicious circle of desire</strong> with a negative comedown afterwards: the bigger stomach you get or the increased bills can lead to you despising yourself. You therefore need to increase the dose or move to a new source. </p> 
    <p><strong>Advertisers have a vested interest in keeping the treadmill in place.</strong> We are constantly bombarded with adverts telling us we can "save money" by buying something new, which is nonsensical if you think about it! Our consumer society constantly encourages us to spend leading to increased materialism and we have been turned into "desiring machines". We keep comparing ourselves with others to reinforce our identity.</p> 
    <p>A new study by <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nn.2726.html">researchers at McGill University</a> found that <strong>dopamine is also released when you listen to music </strong>you enjoy.

    <p><span><strong>Studies have suggested that autonomy is twenty times better at predicting happiness than income.</strong> People with high income but little autonomy are usually much less happy than people with a low income but control over what they do, so if you can find ways of controlling your life, you can be happy even on a low income. </span> Autonomy is also related to health: <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/whitehallII/pdf/Whitehallbooklet_1_.pdf">the Whitehall Study</a> study found that Civil Servants at lower grades had much poorer health than those at higher grades who had more control over their work.</p>

    <p><a href="http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/GettingMostOutGiving.pdf">Researchers at Stanford University</a> found that setting goals to help others that are achievable gives you a greater sense of satisfaction that having an abstract concept of helping others. Givers experience greater happiness if they have concrete, specific goals of benevolence: making someone smile or increasing recycling rather than similar but abstract goals such as like making someone happy or saving the environment. This is because when you pursue concrete goals, your expectations of success are more likely to be met. Jennifer Aaker, the lead researcher said:<em> 'A prosocial act can not only boost the happiness of the recipient, but it can boost the happiness of the giver as well.'</em> Pursuing happiness without clearly defined goals can actually make us more unhappy due to unrealistic expectations. </p> 
    <p>We want to feel that we matter and that we make a difference, that we are contributing to something worthwhile and doing what is "right". There is a direct brain-based link between helping others and happiness. Finding meaning in what you do gives<strong> long term inner satisfaction</strong>. When we think what we do matters we feel that we are being productive and useful. </p>

    <p><strong>Flow is the state reached when we are so immersed in an activity that we cease to notice the passage of time and have deep, effortless involvement.</strong> Time seems to stop. Our happiness is greatest at such times. Sports people call this "being in the zone" and mystics as being in an ecstatic state. It is the full involvement in flow, rather than happiness achieved from sensory pleasures that makes for excellence in life.

    <p>Flow is often experienced in games such as chess or football because they have<strong> goals and rules that make it possible for the player to act without questioning what should be done, and how.</strong> For the duration of the game the player lives in a self-contained universe where everything is black and white. </p> 
    <p> <strong>Flow is rarely experienced in passive leisure activities</strong>, such as watching television or relaxing. <strong>Reading books</strong> leads to a lot of flow experiences whereas watching television rarely produces flow. </p> 
    <p><strong>Flow activities need an initial investment of effort before they start to become enjoyable</strong>. If you are tired, anxious, or lack the self discipline to overcome that hurdle, you may go for relaxation rather than flow activities. You need some time to do nothing; relax on a sunny beach reading a novel, or just watching TV but it should be in proportion. </p> 
    <p><strong>Holidays</strong> can help to clear your mind &amp; to look at your situation from a new perspective. Getting rid of all the unused junk in your home to produce a tidy, uncluttered environment, can also help.</p> 
    <p><strong>Relationships</strong> can of course also have a profound effect on your happiness but this is dependent on the whims of your partner. Flow happiness is of our own making.</p> 
    <p>Flow can also be achieved via prayer or meditation - <strong>being in the moment</strong>. Flow can even be achieved when doing routine tasks: doing the washing up or peeling potatoes, if we approach these tasks with a state of <strong>mindfulness</strong> (total absorption in the task to do it as well as we possibly can). See the Zen saying "<strong><a href="http://www.interluderetreat.com/meditate/chop.htm">Chop wood, carry water!</a></strong>" (see box on right.)</p> 
    <p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.6"> <strong>Lower</strong></span><strong> blood pressure which is related to your state of relaxation</strong> is also correlated with happiness. There is increasing evidence that Vitamin D helps to lower blood pressure.

    <h3>What can you do if you can't change your job?</h3> 
    <p>Sometimes you can't change your job, especially in the short term and with fewer jobs available due to the economy, so how do you make it more meaningful? Sometimes our jobs have an impact on others, but we’re too distant from the customers or end users to see this. For example when <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597806000641">university telephone callers responsible for getting donations from alumni</a> spent 10&nbsp;minutes talking to just one beneficiary of their work they increased their weekly revenue by over 400%. When we see the direct consequences of our jobs for other people,&nbsp;we find more meaning in our work. </p> 
    <p><strong><a href="http://hbr.org/2010/06/managing-yourself-turn-the-job-you-have-into-the-job-you-want/ar/1"></a></strong> An exercise called <strong>job crafting</strong> can help to reenergise your work. It involves redefining your job to incorporate your motives, strengths, and passions. You to visualize the job, map its elements, and reorganize them to better suit you. You can put personal touches on how you see and do your job, and you’ll gain a greater sense of control at work becoming happier and more effective.</p> 
    <p>You can change the boundaries of your job by taking on more or fewer <strong>tasks</strong>, expanding or diminishing their scope, or changing how they are performed. A graduate in sales for example might take on additional event planning because he likes the challenge of organizing people and logistics. You can also change the nature or extent of your <strong>interactions with others, </strong>for example hospital cleaners who lacked patient contact&nbsp;<a href="http://amr.aom.org/content/26/2/179.short" target="_blank">provided emotional support to patients and their families</a> and <strong>how you think about the purpose of certain aspects of your job</strong>. For more about job crafting, see<strong> </strong><a href="http://hbr.org/2010/06/managing-yourself-turn-the-job-you-have-into-the-job-you-want/ar/1">"Turn the Job You Have into the Job You Want".</a></p> 
    <p>If you can't change your work in the above ways, another solution is to find meaning outside your work by <a href="../workin/voluntaryWork.htm"><strong>volunteering</strong></a> in evenings or weekends or <a href="http://www.hotcourses.com">taking an evening or online course</a>. I remember one drama graduate who wasn't talented enough to become an actress and eventually ended up in a rather boring job as an administrator for an airline, but she gained great satisfaction by becoming a leading light in her local amateur theatre company.</p>

It is simply made of human desire.”</em></td>
