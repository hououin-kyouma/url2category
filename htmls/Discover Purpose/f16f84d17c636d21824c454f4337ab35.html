       <h2 class="tq"><img src="http://www.ThinkTQ.com/images/fluff/tqarrows.gif" align="bottom" alt="TQ"> The TWO Great Tragedies In Life...</h2> 
       <p> It has been said that the two great tragedies in life are these: Not knowing your purpose—not knowing why you are here on Earth... and once you know your purpose—not LIVING it with passion and dedication... every single day you are alive. </p>
       <p> Pastor Rick Warren, in his thought-provoking book, <i>The Purpose-Driven Life</i>, posed the question of the ages... </p>
       <p> </p>
       <blockquote class="shout" style="color:#088A29;">
        "What on Earth Am I Here For?"
       </blockquote> 
       <p> However, once you know the answer to this question—once you understand the Divine reason for your existence—there's an even bigger question to be answered... </p>
       <p> </p>
       <blockquote class="shout" style="color:#088A29;">
        "How in the world am I going 
        <br>to make this happen?!"
       </blockquote> 
       <p> Just HOW can I live a life of passion and purpose? What, exactly, am I expected to do? How can I transform my life's purpose into an unstoppable mission... and ultimately achieve the success I desire, personally and professionally? </p>
       <p> <a href="/order/index.cfm?pc=SOPCOACHINGBUNDLEDOWNLOAD" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.thinktq.com/images/products/SOP_3DShadCD_Sm3e.jpg" border="0" width="100" align="right" style="margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:25px"></a> You may have struggled with clarity of purpose and direction for your entire life. By the time you complete Success On Purpose, this will no longer be an issue. You will—maybe for the first time ever—discover your Natural Mission in life. </p>
       <p> The good news is that there is a simple formula for determining your life's Natural Mission—a formula that contains only 3 variables. </p>
       <p> Plug in your unique Visions, Values and Roles, and you will have the starting point for living your dreams and goals... the foundation for achieving Purpose-Driven Success. </p>
       <p> You will discover how your values, vision, and roles combine in your life... giving you inherent direction and purpose for every choice you make and every action you take... permitting you to create the life you were intended to live. </p>
       <p> By the time you finish reading this simple to understand book — and complete the personal exercises — you will understand your unique Purpose... exactly how your Natural Mission forms... and find Inherent Direction for your life. </p>
       <p> You will become a Purpose-Driven Success. </p>
       <p> You will discover—and achieve—your life's Natural Mission. </p>
       <p> Guaranteed. </p>

This is the Starting Point for not only improving your TQ, but also for <i>immediately</i> improving your life. </p><p> </p><h2> A Simple Truth...</h2> <p> </p><p>The truth is, understanding your purpose in life is not just a good idea.

Understand the WHY of your existence, then living your purpose becomes much easier—and far more rewarding. </p><p> Without a clear sense of "Who Am I, and Why Am I Here," there is no need to improve your performance. You don't know where you are going, so there is no real need to help you get there any faster. </p><p> However, once you truly understand your unique purpose, your performance is everything. Why? Because you want to actually LIVE your purpose—rather than just passively watch your life go by. </p><p> Why is this a serious issue? </p><p> <a href="/order/index.cfm?pc=SOPCOACHINGBUNDLEDOWNLOAD" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.thinktq.com/images/products/SOP_3DShadCD_Sm3e.jpg" border="0" width="100" align="right" style="margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:15px"></a> <b>Without a strong sense of purpose and direction, people...</b> </p><p></p>

        <blockquote class="important">
         It should be noted that Success On Purpose is not at all "theological" in nature, but helps people understand the importance of actually LIVING the "Purpose-Driven Life" Rick Warren so beautifully described.
         <p>In a way, Success On Purpose is the performance-oriented followup to his inspiring and life-changing book. Where his book is about the big WHY of life... our book is all about the HOW... and was designed to give you the starting-point to get going and keep growing.</p>
        </blockquote> <p> Our point is well served by these select testimonials: To LIVE a life of passion and purpose... to LIVE a purpose-driven life... requires you to not just talk about it... think about it... or feel the inner-calling.</p><p>No, to LIVE your Purpose requires you to PERFORM on Purpose.</p><p>After all, when God tells me to do something, I have no other choice but to DO it.

Thus High Expectations and Brilliant Execution results in seemingly no time at all. This is what doing, being and contributing our best at any given time and in the least amount of time necessary, is all about. Congratulations to you and the TQ TEAM."<p></p> <p>— GG</p> <h2 class="tq"><img src="http://www.ThinkTQ.com/images/fluff/tqarrows.gif" align="bottom" alt="TQ"> From Pastor Paul Early...</h2> <p> "When I finished reading Success On Purpose for the first time, I was astonished at how well (and how simply) you nailed the notion of Natural Mission and Authentic Direction!</p><p>We are all on a Mission as Rick Warren says. No question, we all have a Divine Purpose guiding our lives and the multiple Missions we take on in this one life we have to live." </p><p> "I was a little taken back when I came across St. Teresa of Avila's quote you used on page 62.

"No Hands But Yours." </p><p>But somehow, when I came across it as you were discussing how your Natural Mission forms when you "triangulate" your Visions, Values and Roles, it jumped out at me as if Christ was saying to me, "Pay attention Paul...

Recently I found myself gravely injured, empty handed, almost literally with nothing but the clothes on my back, my dreams, and my values. Turning as soon as I was able to Success on Purpose, I find myself just six months later with a reinvented life. Each day is filled with hard work and commitment, but is exciting, guided by principles and values, some of which I discredited much of my life." </p><p></p> "If TQ and Success on Purpose were a boat leaving a desert island, every other self-help book I've ever read might be usefully bound up for use only as ballast." <p></p> "Success on Purpose is a masterpiece of living, working, growing and flourishing—with, through, and among people. Use this book; consume it as though your life depended upon it—because it does. It's not about you; it's about everyone you will ever meet or love.

Two of the enemies I identified were lack of self-discipline and busyness." </p><p></p> "Personally speaking, I believe that anyone who identifies with these 'enemies'—regardless of their particular focus in life—will discover in Success on Purpose something extremely valuable: they will be given a practical, hands-on tool for identifying and capitalizing on their own major reasons for winning any challenge they may face in terms of their own self development." <p></p> "While I approach life from a faith-based background and don't believe anything in print can replace an ongoing, intimate relationship with Jesus, I do consider Success On Purpose to be one of the finest resources available for assisting people in their pursuit of living a full and meaningful life." <p></p> "Having served most of my life in one form or another in what might be termed a coaching capacity—including serving over twenty years as the Director of Internships in a seminary setting—I quite naturally gravitate to anything that provides people with concrete steps of action to help them become better persons. In fact, that's one reason I ended up requiring my student interns to acquire and use The Power Of TQ as a part of their internship training and why I recommend Success On Purpose: simply put, it is filled with those concrete steps of action!" <p></p> "On a more personal note, I appreciate it when I can get to know a person well enough to sense their heartbeat regarding a particular endeavor, and I can say from my experience that E. R. Haas has reflected to me a consistent, passionate desire to help others discover their purpose and live a life of personal fulfillment." <p></p> "Many thanks to E. R., Kent and the entire Success On Purpose team for not only the privilege of working with you on this project in a small way, but also for being a very positive influence to me personally, way before I was able to do so!" <p></p> — Lee Wise, Director of Internships Baptist Bible Seminary (1987-2009) <p> </p><h2 class="tq"><img src="http://www.ThinkTQ.com/images/fluff/tqarrows.gif" align="bottom" alt="TQ"> From Pastor Esther Chambers...</h2> <p> "One of my favorite sayings is, 'Life is a journey not a destination.'

Or, will I arise and allow life's circumstances to control me like a dandelion seed caught in crosswinds?" </p><p> "How does one develop a crystal-clear vision of a spiritual calling or any calling, be it entrepreneurial, academic, or otherwise? Then, how does one move from a place of vision into action and follow-through?" </p><p> <b>"ThinkTQ's Success on Purpose is the best success-creation system I've ever come across.

It has easy-to-follow diagrams and methods which anyone can use to move from a place of confusion to a place of clarity, power and execution."</b> </p><p> "ThinkTQ's Success on Purpose is a compass, a tool box and a teacher presented in the form of a success book. </p><p> Success on Purpose empowers me daily to follow my dreams, but more importantly, using ThinkTQ's success system, I combined three important roles in my life to guarantee that I will not only live MY best life... but to help others do so as well." </p><p> Most Sincerely, </p><p> Pastor Esther Chambers </p><p> </p><p> </p><h2 class="tq"><img src="http://www.ThinkTQ.com/images/fluff/tqarrows.gif" align="bottom" alt="TQ"> From Annie Armen, Producer/Director...</h2> <p> "Here is how I can best describe ThinkTQ, Inc. ThinkTQ is like a treasure island. If you dig in deep enough, you will locate their global well rich in resources and nutrients for the human mind, heart, body, and soul.

R. Haas always says." </p><p></p> "I am a walking testament to you both after producing Legends in Excellenceª, and walking proof of how Success on Purpose rolls! Thank you E. R. Haas and Kent Madson, not only for creating a starting point, but for scientifically proving where one must PRO-actively begin to apply your provided fountain of knowledge consistently over time, in order to achieve brilliant results!" <p></p> "Here's the bottom line: Success on Purpose—MORE than a Book, MORE than a Success Map, MORE than a Directional Performance Guide—it is your Starting Point to your Mission on Demand™ now, it is your key to unlock the greatest doors of your life, of your destiny, to fulfill your legacy in Intentional Excellence! So don't just read Success on Purpose, use it, turn it, open your success door, Expect More, Execute Better, and win, because you CAN!" <p> </p><p>— Hurricane Annie</p> <p> </p><h2 class="tq"><img src="http://www.ThinkTQ.com/images/fluff/tqarrows.gif" align="bottom" alt="TQ"> From Tim McFadden...</h2> <p> Here is my blurb: "This book was a vehicle of revelation for me." </p><p> That is so true. But there is much more... </p><p> I consider myself just an average guy, but if you put a blurb like that and say "Tim McFadden, Attorney and Doctoral Candidate in Theology, Oxford", it might carry more weight—I mean if you want to add mine to whatever else you've got, which I won't presume is worth it. But I do want to help! </p><p> <b>I see you guys working in a sort of Proverbs of Solomon space, yes? It's good practical wisdom about how things actually do work, regardless of how much noise one is making about "religion."</b> </p><p> There was that ancient Solomonic sense of Wisdom being the warp and woof of reality; and now we have the Logos of John 1 as the full revelation of this reality. </p><p> So I think it glorifies God (who meets us <i>everywhere</i> certainly in daily life: it says he cares about how the stones in the trader's bags are weighted) as you just keep diligently, prayerfully pumping out true stuff about how life actually works. </p><p> </p>
        <blockquote class="important">
         It really has been part of an improvement in my life (though I backslide from time-to-time!) just by the presence of reality in your work, which seems to me grace from God — who, Incarnate, spent more years nailing, cutting and sanding than he did preaching.
        </blockquote> <p> Anyway, keep it going, E.R. Fight the good fight. </p><p> And thanks, </p><p> Tim </p><p> </p>
        <center>
         * * *
        </center><p> Tim -- </p><p> Thank you so much for the wonderful thoughts and the encouragement it represents. </p><p> I too am a man of faith, and strongly -- actually with 100% of my body, mind and soul -- right down to the DNA strands believe that James was right: there is no faith without works. </p><p> Here's what the Holy Bible says about Faith and Deeds... </p><p> </p>
        <blockquote class="important">
         James 14: What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? 15: Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. 16: If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? 17: In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. 18: But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds."
         <p>Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.</p>
        </blockquote> <p> I know that Paul and Peter had a "time" with James, arguing if faith is all we need, but if we do not ACT on our faith... take ACTION to right the wrongs, help the poor, feed the sick (all verbs) -- then what we have in the end are words that are not true expressions of our faith -- to serve -- to love -- to help -- to, as I like to put it, live the law with love. </p><p> <b>While TQ is in no way a theological undertaking, it does help people become more efficient, effective and powerful at delivering on their "good intentions".</b> </p><p> No question, we are saved by Grace... but leave a legacy of works/results that derive from our faith in action. </p><p> </p>
        <blockquote class="important">
         This is why Success On Purpose is so important. It connects our Divine Purpose with Personal Performance. The only way we can LIVE our Purpose... is to PERFORM on Purpose.
        </blockquote> <p> If we get this right, we will help millions of people help billions of people throughout the world! </p><p> God bless and thank you Tim! </p><p> E. R. </p><p> </p>
