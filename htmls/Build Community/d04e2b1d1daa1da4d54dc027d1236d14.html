Like a lot of people my age, I was unprepared for the challenge of forging new friendships without the built-in social network of a school environment.&nbsp;It’s hard to put down roots when you’re living a nomadic lifestyle.  And worst of all, it’s lonely. I spent many nights by myself, just me and my movie collection.<\/p><p>But I’m proud to say that in each new home, I have been able to make friends—great friends—even if I was there for a short time. It wasn’t as easy as moving into a shared dorm or chumming it up over a class project, but the basic principles are the same. Making friends requires community and an open and welcoming disposition. But where should you start, and where can you find like-minded people? Here are some tips.<\/p><h2>01. Join a professional organization.<\/h2><p>You have your diploma and, if you’re lucky, a shiny new job, but that doesn’t mean you have it all figured out. And that’s <em>OK<\/em>. Tap into a professional organization that will help you figure out what direction to take your career and connect you with people in your industry. Advance your career? Make connections? Possibly make a new best friend? Sign me up!<\/p><p>Betsy Hays, APR, M.A., coauthor of the book <em><\/em><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Life-after-College-Steps-Build/dp/1442225971/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\">Life After College: Ten Steps to Build a Life You Love<\/a>&nbsp;<\/em>(cowritten by Tori Randolph Terhune),&nbsp;says that tapping into professional networks is a great way to&nbsp;meet new people.&nbsp;“Most cities have committees or small groups you can become a part of, giving you an opportunity to get to know others more quickly and also perhaps learn something new or expand on a current skill set,”&nbsp;Hays says.&nbsp;“Chambers of Commerce are great and found in most cities, and many professions have industry-related organizations as well—either exclusive to a community or as a chapter of a national organization.”&nbsp;Ask your boss and coworkers about possible networks to join.<\/p><h2>02. Get active.<\/h2><p>When I first moved, I found a local running group, where I met my current marathon training partner. I stuck with something I already had a passion for, but Hays suggests getting into something a little more out of the box.&nbsp;“Perhaps try bowling or Ultimate Frisbee; be creative to expand your horizons,”&nbsp;she says. Joining a site such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/\">MeetUp.com<\/a> is a great way to connect.&nbsp;“These groups cover everything from pet-lovers to hiking to business networking. There really is something for everyone,”&nbsp;Hays says. I have absolutely done this, in particular for hiking groups. (I am no navigator!) There are film enthusiasts, book clubs, dance groups—you name it. Besides exploring different hobbies, learning something new is a great way to create solid bonds with people.<\/p><h2>03. Get a roommate.<\/h2><p>My first job out of college found me in a one-bedroom apartment completely by myself because I had moved to a new city and knew <em>no one.<\/em> Looking back, I wish I had branched out and taken a chance with a roommate. Sharing your living space with another person creates instant community. Maybe you won’t become BFFs, but maybe you will. There are <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/18/business/la-fi-tn-roommate-finding-apps-20130816\">several apps<\/a>&nbsp;available to screen possible roomies, so you don’t have to go the Craigslist route if you don’t want to.<\/p><h2>04. Volunteer.<\/h2><p>It’s time to reach out. As Hays says, volunteering doesn’t have to be a serious commitment.&nbsp;“Volunteer for either a one-time event or a committee for a cause you deeply believe in,”&nbsp;she says.&nbsp;“You’ll meet people with similar values and interests, and you’ll feel more purposeful, [which is] always a good thing.”&nbsp;Check with churches, or register for a volunteer network such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.volunteermatch.org/?creative=59149192097&amp;keyword=volunteer%20match&amp;matchtype=e&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;gclid=CPGVkIj30MYCFYMYHwodpbsMtA\">VolunteerMatch<\/a>, which has thousands of opportunities for all kinds of interests and passions.<\/p><h2>05. Be an initiator.<\/h2><p>A great way to feel more social is to be the person who rallies everyone together. Start a book club with coworkers (and tell them to bring a friend), or a suggest a brunch outing for foodies via MeetUp.com. It doesn’t have to be a club; being a leader means not waiting around for acquaintances to invite you. Ask your family and friends to&nbsp;“set you up”&nbsp;with people they know in your city. I met my mom’s second cousin and her husband (hey, they’re&nbsp;family!) for a meal when I first moved to a new area, and it helped make the move a lot less overwhelming. These friends of friends or extended relatives can offer great advice about where the locals eat, shop, and hang out—and don’t forget to ask them to think of you next time they do anything social.<\/p><p>Thinking back to childhood best friends, it all seemed so easy and natural. As an adult, however, the quest to be social can seem daunting and scary.&nbsp;No matter how you look at it, making friends as an adult can be hard. Just remind yourself that the great people are out there—you just have to put in a little more effort to find them.<\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202400125ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202400125ce","createdTimestamp":"2015-07-14T07:02:48Z","versionId":"9","primaryImageId":"ci01d36e34c001c80a","path":"/2015/07/how-to-make-friends-as-an-adult-life-after-college-friendship-relationships","associatedRichTerms":[{"isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-05-23T16:30:28Z","createdPrincipalId":"up01cda93f200099de","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci020b7202400125ce","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Relationships","authoringStatusCode":"complete","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b8226d860f","height":796,"cloudinaryVersionId":1446480286,"id":"ci01dca46210009512","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Relationships Section Heading","primaryPhotoId":"ci01dca46210009512","hasFaces":true,"width":1410,"publicId":"assets/MTM0MTYyODI5MTkxMTkxMDA2","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2015-11-02T16:04:49Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01cb70fb90009512","bytes":182372,"primarySiteId":"cs01cb70fb90009512","migrationId":"f23163ede834f17dfdab0c005b3abc0227f632eb"},"vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:sections","editedByPrincipalId":"up01cda93f200099de","editedTimestamp":"2017-08-29T15:17:16Z","disqusId":"2124d5eb-3fd5-11e7-af36-06e903dde794","alternateUrls":["/category/relationships","/category/relationships/"],"originalPublicationTimestamp":"2017-05-23T16:30:28Z","createdTimestamp":"2017-08-29T15:17:16Z","versionId":"3","primaryImageId":"ci01dca46210009512","path":"/relationships","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"relationships","displayName":"Relationships","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01cb70fb90009512","primarySiteId":"cs01cb70fb90009512","migrationId":"section-transition-ci01db2dc6f0049512","statusCode":"complete"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:27:52Z","createdPrincipalId":"up017cc6ed8d32860e","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0aa700499de","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"friendship","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedByPrincipalId":"up017cc6ed8d32860e","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:27:52Z","disqusId":"7bb0061c-fd05-11e4-8c77-001ec9b40b46","originalPublicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:27:52Z","createdTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:27:52Z","versionId":"1","path":"/tag/friendship/","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"friendship","displayName":"friendship","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01cb70fb90009512","primarySiteId":"cs01cb70fb90009512","statusCode":"complete"}],"isWorkInProgress":false,"socialPopularity":535,"slug":"how-to-make-friends-as-an-adult-life-after-college-friendship-relationships","contentNodeId":"cn01d313052000efe2","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01cb70fb90009512","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2015-09-29T13:48:48Z","publicationTimestamp":"2015-09-29T13:48:48Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b8227b860f","id":"ci01cec0ca300099de","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","title":"Emily Mitchell","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","slug":"emitchell","editedByPrincipalId":"up016bb0b8227b860f","disqusId":"861b3e64-66eb-11e5-be2e-0022195fd05d","email":"emitchell@verilymag.com","originalPublicationTimestamp":"2015-09-29T13:48:48Z","bio":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Emily Mitchell is a Junior Web Producer for&nbsp;Prevention&nbsp;magazine and EatClean.com.

             <p>Since graduating from college three years ago, I have had four different jobs and moved cross-country three times. Like a lot of people my age, I was unprepared for the challenge of forging new friendships without the built-in social network of a school environment.&nbsp;It’s hard to put down roots when you’re living a nomadic lifestyle. And worst of all, it’s lonely. I spent many nights by myself, just me and my movie collection.</p>

             <p>But I’m proud to say that in each new home, I have been able to make friends—great friends—even if I was there for a short time. It wasn’t as easy as moving into a shared dorm or chumming it up over a class project, but the basic principles are the same. Making friends requires community and an open and welcoming disposition. But where should you start, and where can you find like-minded people? Here are some tips.</p>
             <h2>01. Join a professional organization.</h2>
             <p>You have your diploma and, if you’re lucky, a shiny new job, but that doesn’t mean you have it all figured out. And that’s <em>OK</em>. Tap into a professional organization that will help you figure out what direction to take your career and connect you with people in your industry. Advance your career? Make connections? Possibly make a new best friend? Sign me up!</p>
             <p>Betsy Hays, APR, M.A., coauthor of the book <em></em><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-after-College-Steps-Build/dp/1442225971/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8">Life After College: Ten Steps to Build a Life You Love</a>&nbsp;</em>(cowritten by Tori Randolph Terhune),&nbsp;says that tapping into professional networks is a great way to&nbsp;meet new people.&nbsp;“Most cities have committees or small groups you can become a part of, giving you an opportunity to get to know others more quickly and also perhaps learn something new or expand on a current skill set,”&nbsp;Hays says.&nbsp;“Chambers of Commerce are great and found in most cities, and many professions have industry-related organizations as well—either exclusive to a community or as a chapter of a national organization.”&nbsp;Ask your boss and coworkers about possible networks to join.</p>

             <h2>02. Get active.</h2>
             <p>When I first moved, I found a local running group, where I met my current marathon training partner. I stuck with something I already had a passion for, but Hays suggests getting into something a little more out of the box.&nbsp;“Perhaps try bowling or Ultimate Frisbee; be creative to expand your horizons,”&nbsp;she says. Joining a site such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/">MeetUp.com</a> is a great way to connect.&nbsp;“These groups cover everything from pet-lovers to hiking to business networking. There really is something for everyone,”&nbsp;Hays says. I have absolutely done this, in particular for hiking groups. (I am no navigator!) There are film enthusiasts, book clubs, dance groups—you name it. Besides exploring different hobbies, learning something new is a great way to create solid bonds with people.</p>
             <h2>03. Get a roommate.</h2>
             <p>My first job out of college found me in a one-bedroom apartment completely by myself because I had moved to a new city and knew <em>no one.</em> Looking back, I wish I had branched out and taken a chance with a roommate. Sharing your living space with another person creates instant community. Maybe you won’t become BFFs, but maybe you will. There are <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/18/business/la-fi-tn-roommate-finding-apps-20130816">several apps</a>&nbsp;available to screen possible roomies, so you don’t have to go the Craigslist route if you don’t want to.</p>
             <h2>04. Volunteer.</h2>
             <p>It’s time to reach out. As Hays says, volunteering doesn’t have to be a serious commitment.&nbsp;“Volunteer for either a one-time event or a committee for a cause you deeply believe in,”&nbsp;she says.&nbsp;“You’ll meet people with similar values and interests, and you’ll feel more purposeful, [which is] always a good thing.”&nbsp;Check with churches, or register for a volunteer network such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.volunteermatch.org/?creative=59149192097&amp;keyword=volunteer%20match&amp;matchtype=e&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;gclid=CPGVkIj30MYCFYMYHwodpbsMtA">VolunteerMatch</a>, which has thousands of opportunities for all kinds of interests and passions.</p>

             <h2>05. Be an initiator.</h2>
             <p>A great way to feel more social is to be the person who rallies everyone together. Start a book club with coworkers (and tell them to bring a friend), or a suggest a brunch outing for foodies via MeetUp.com. It doesn’t have to be a club; being a leader means not waiting around for acquaintances to invite you. Ask your family and friends to&nbsp;“set you up”&nbsp;with people they know in your city. I met my mom’s second cousin and her husband (hey, they’re&nbsp;family!) for a meal when I first moved to a new area, and it helped make the move a lot less overwhelming. These friends of friends or extended relatives can offer great advice about where the locals eat, shop, and hang out—and don’t forget to ask them to think of you next time they do anything social.</p>
             <p>Thinking back to childhood best friends, it all seemed so easy and natural. As an adult, however, the quest to be social can seem daunting and scary.&nbsp;No matter how you look at it, making friends as an adult can be hard. Just remind yourself that the great people are out there—you just have to put in a little more effort to find them.</p>

Even when it's a friend and you're just there for emotional support, no one likes to watch their friend&nbsp;&nbsp;suffering. And while you clearly get props for bringing on a steady stream of Starbucks Frappuccinos and pedicures, once the creamy concoction is gone and the paint is dry, there is some emotional work left to do. Here are five&nbsp;things to remember when supporting your friend through her breakup.<\/p><p><strong>Cut him off.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p><p><a href=\"http://www.match.com/magazine/article/12126/How-To-Mend-Your-Broken-Heart/\">A study<\/a> published in the <em>Journal of Neurophysiology<\/em> found that when you go through a breakup, your body responds similarly to an addict going through withdrawal. Allow her to freely express herself—whether it is anger, sadness, or numbness. But then she&nbsp;should 'quit' her ex. “Don’t call. Throw out the cards and letters, and don’t write. Don’t be near the other person,\" suggests study author Helen Fischer, Ph.D. Another coping mechanism? Suggesting she unfriend her ex on Facebook. A <a href=\"http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/getting-over-a-break-up\">study<\/a> published in <em>Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking <\/em>found that&nbsp;“staying connected to an ex on Facebook can halt your recovery from the breakup and stunt your&nbsp;personal growth.\"<\/p><p><strong>Allow her to bash—briefly<strong>—and then let go<\/strong>.<\/strong><\/p><p> She probably has some choice words for her ex, and while you may be tempted to chime in, don't.&nbsp;Instead, help her get out of the habit of speaking about the person,&nbsp;suggests <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/collections/201309/the-good-breakup/how-act-after-break%20\">Gina Barreca, Ph.D<\/a>. Encourage her to let go. The past cannot be changed, and she now has the choice to no longer dwell in all the awful things he did to her. Encourage her to make a clean break, and check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trWgx7YoZyk\">this helpful video from SoulPancake<\/a> that may help her heal.<\/p><p><strong>Prepare yourself for changes in your friendship.<\/strong><\/p><p> Your friend is experiencing a major life transition, and this is likely to effect other aspects of her life—including your friendship. As Suzanne Lachmann, Psy.D., points out in her article titled <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/me-we/201402/4-ways-be-good-friend-during-friends-breakup%20\">\"4 Ways to Be a Good Friend During a Friend's Breakup,\"<\/a>&nbsp;\"Your friend is grieving … it might not be possible right now for them to be as good a friend to you as you are used to. This is not indicative of how the rest of your lives will be … be ready for them to be flaky, distant, insensitive, even dismissive. It's easy to be friends when you both feel good about life, yourselves, and each other—it's harder with someone who seems to need you desperately one minute and hate you the next. You are experiencing your friend's fear, despair, disappointment, and shame turned outward.\" And that&nbsp;leads to the next point.<\/p><p><strong>Don't fully take on her emotions.<\/strong><\/p><p> Being a shoulder to cry on or an open ear to listen during this time is an essential part of being a supportive (and loving) friend. Empathy is a vital part of showing comfort. But taking on her feelings, or overwhelming yourself with trying to figure out how to make her feel better or move on faster,&nbsp;is a boundary you don't need to cross. Take the pressure off your shoulders of feeling responsible for her healing. You don't need to have the perfect advice. She most likely needs you to listen, and if you are not present (that is, solving her problems in your head or looking for the right words), you'll fail to actually listen to her.<\/p><p><strong>Suggest professional help.<\/strong><\/p><p> Major life changes can often be traumatic. So why suffer alone? If you notice your friend withdrawing or becoming depressed, don't be afraid to suggest she seek extra help, guidance, or counsel from a professional, whether a therapist or a general doctor. You are close with her, and you know when something isn't right. It may be hard for her to hear, but your love for her should surpass any stigma or judgment.<\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202400125ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202400125ce","primaryImageId":"ci01cec0d0a002c80a","path":"/2014/08/5-ways-to-help-a-friend-heal-after-a-breakup","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa70009512"},{"isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-05-23T16:30:28Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci020b7202400125ce","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Relationships","primaryImage":{"height":796,"cloudinaryVersionId":1446480286,"id":"ci01dca46210009512","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Relationships Section Heading","primaryPhotoId":"ci01dca46210009512","hasFaces":true,"width":1410,"publicId":"assets/MTM0MTYyODI5MTkxMTkxMDA2","format":"jpg","bytes":182372,"migrationId":"f23163ede834f17dfdab0c005b3abc0227f632eb"},"vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:sections","editedTimestamp":"2017-08-29T15:17:16Z","disqusId":"2124d5eb-3fd5-11e7-af36-06e903dde794","primaryImageId":"ci01dca46210009512","path":"/relationships","slug":"relationships","displayName":"Relationships","migrationId":"section-transition-ci01db2dc6f0049512"}],"socialPopularity":89,"cardTypeCode":"","slug":"5-ways-to-help-a-friend-heal-after-a-breakup","contentNodeId":"cn01cec0d0b002c80a","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2015-09-29T13:48:48Z","publicationTimestamp":"2015-09-29T13:48:48Z","id":"ci01cec0ca300099de","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","title":"Emily Mitchell","slug":"emitchell","disqusId":"861b3e64-66eb-11e5-be2e-0022195fd05d","email":"emitchell@verilymag.com","bio":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Emily Mitchell is a Junior Web Producer for&nbsp;Prevention&nbsp;magazine and EatClean.com.

She lives in Iowa and I in New York; she works full time, and I’m pursuing my master’s.&nbsp;We’re both busy, but I don't think that's the only reason we sometimes struggle to prioritize our friendship. Besides our lack of proximity, I suspect our friendship growing pains have something to do with our respective relationship status: She's married, and I'm single.<\/p><p>It’s naive to think that relationships will not evolve over time. People change; circumstances change. But when I think about us, I sometimes feel burdened by the lack of details we’ve shared with each other over the last year. The lack of calls, the lack of updates or heart-to-hearts. As the single friend, I’m sometimes unsure how to navigate initiating this new friendship on new terms and perhaps even new boundaries. Can I still come over unannounced? Is anytime still a good time to talk? Are you still my go-to wing-woman?<\/p><p>It takes two people to make a friendship last and,&nbsp;as I contemplate my own situation, I realize that&nbsp;there are things I wish my married friends knew they could do to help make this shift in our friendship easier for us both. This is the beginning of a new phase of friendship. I'm up for the challenge, are you?<\/p><h2>01. Keep Me in Your Calendar<\/h2><p>One of the first things my married friends have expressed about the first months of marriage is that there’s so much newness it’s overwhelming to consider someone else apart from their spouse. But as you’re forging through all this novelty, you are going to want to keep your good friends closer than ever.<\/p><p>Zach Brittle,&nbsp;Certified Gottman Therapist and <em><\/em><a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/11/tools-for-an-intentional-marriage-friendship-community\"><em>Verily<\/em>'s go-to intentional marriage guy<\/a>, explains that every married couple needs to have a \"band,\" or group of friends you can have to yourself.&nbsp;\"This is where you blow off steam—something each person needs. Get loud. Play,\" Brittle explains.<\/p><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p>\"[...]My “band” is an over-40 soccer team. We’re terrible, but we run around each week forgetting for an hour that we’re mortal. My wife’s “band” is totally different. It almost doesn’t matter what it is; you just need a place strictly to enjoy and be enjoyed. Relationships are hard. Period. Add the stress and strain of the daily grind, and a little release becomes imperative. The Band is a critical outlet for couples seeking to reduce stress and build enjoyment in one another.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Even through all the changes, keep your friend in your plans. Make an active effort to have one-on-one quality time, as I’m sure you used to. Doesn't your husband want a guys' night every so often, too? Plan one night a month where you get drinks with your single friend, and he meets up with his old pals.<\/p><p>You can hang out with your single friends as a couple too. Invite us along even when you’ll be out with your spouse’s friends, or when you planned a game night and only couples may be showing up. Invite more than one of your single friends, or ask your married friends if they have any single friends they would like to invite. There’s no need for married people to couple off and leave their single friends outside the clique.<\/p><h2>02. Make Sure Your Husband Knows That Your Friends Are Important<\/h2><p>Nothing is more reassuring than a spouse who supports all your relationships. If your spouse knows the importance of the other relationships in your life, he’ll give you the space to nurture them. Because one of my best friends is really inclusive and open with her husband about her plans with friends, I’ve built a really positive relationship with him as well.<\/p><p>Zach Brittle also explains <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/11/tools-for-an-intentional-marriage-friendship-community\">in his article<\/a> that having a close friend who you can talk to about your marriage and who wants your marriage to succeed is critical to a healthy marriage. Brittle calls this friend \"The Best-Kept Secret.\" \"This is the friend who just plain gets it,\" he explains.<\/p><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p>\"You can tell this friend anything. Ideally this friend is the same sex as you . . . at the very least, he or she isn’t a possible alternative to your spouse. The “secret” is that this person will always, always be on your side. He’s in your corner no matter what. She’s the wind at your back. In the best-case scenario, this friend is a friend of the marriage so that when things get tough, you know you can count on this person to protect both you and your relationship.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Don’t be afraid to discuss with your spouse the value of your friendships outside the marriage and the shared joys in your friend’s lives. If a friend is in need, and your husband knows how important she is to you, he shouldn't mind letting you devote some time to her.&nbsp;He’ll appreciate your keeping him current in the other facets of your life, and ultimately give you the emotional freedom to be a more prominent figure in your friend’s lives.<\/p><h2>03. Know That We Rely on You<\/h2><p>Thankfully, I’m still able to call my married friend when all hell breaks loose and I need help making important life decisions or have to gab about my own love life. As much as you needed us when you wanted to dissect your first date with your current husband, you can bet your friends will continue to need you to share in their joys and sorrows—to be that person we can dissect our budding relationships with.<\/p><p>Be intentional about knowing your friend’s hearts. It will rarely just be about showing up for the scheduled coffee date, shopping date, or movie night—it will be about being able to provide that unconditional support and listening ears that are essential to healthy relationships.<\/p><h2>04. We Don’t Need Pity, Just Friendship<\/h2><p>There have been several times in my friendships with married friends where I’ve felt a certain sense of sadness or disappointment—like they think the pace I live my life and the decisions I make aren’t necessarily conducive to “meeting someone.” This pressure to be married, like she is, can be frustrating and unhelpful.<\/p><p>I know you are happily married and you want your single friends to be happy too. But it’s hard on a friendship when you feel like your friends wish you would stop being single already. Trust that we can be and very likely <em>are<\/em> happy with the stage of life we are in now. Help us to be patient by being patient with us. We may join you as a fellow married woman or we may not, but our lives have worth and purpose now.<\/p><p>You <em>will<\/em> change; your single friends <em>will<\/em> change. Still, the people that really love each other stick around. Every single stage in life that challenges you and your relationships, often strengthens your relationship, too.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"http://brittrenephoto.com/\">Britt Rene

tml-version=\"2\" --><div tml-image=\"ci01cec0d300012a83\" tml-image-caption=\"Art Credit: Laurence Philomene\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><p> Loyalty is perhaps the most prized quality in any kind of relationship. Those who can claim this virtue are often blessed with <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304887904576397801582783690\">better health<\/a> and overall relationship satisfaction and happiness—professionally, personally, and romantically. &nbsp;Even something as small as continuing to root for your hometown sports team when you make a big move is good for your psyche!<\/p><p> So what does it really mean to be loyal?&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ambigamy/201309/loyalty-paradoxical-faith-not-ok-is-ok\">Researchers<\/a>&nbsp;define loyalty:<\/p><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p>\"We love each other’s loyalty to us. Nothing would please us more than carte blanche freedom to do what we want, without risk to the security of other people's support. We dream of a loyal fan base, a loyal readership, a loyal spouse, a high plateau we could reach and stay on securely forever.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p> So when it comes to friendships, are you the loyal one who makes your friends feel secure? Keep reading to find out how you can create and utilize the virtue of loyalty.<\/p><p><strong>1. A loyal friend is honest.<\/strong><\/p><p>A good rule to remember: Don't expect loyalty if you can't provide honesty. \"A loyal friend might not agree with you all the time and they won’t always have the same opinions as yours, but they still want you to know the truth,\" says writer <a href=\"http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/12616/1/Difference-Between-an-Ordinary-and-a-Loyal-Friend.html\">Stan Tian<\/a>. You&nbsp;may not feed her pity party with platitudes, but that is exactly what she needs in&nbsp;a loyal friend. You want&nbsp;the best for her, and the truth should be a benefit.<\/p><p><strong>2. Loyal friends are impartial.<\/strong><\/p><p> That might&nbsp;sound blasé, but it is not an apathetic attribute. Being impartial means you are accepting, non-discriminatory, and view others' lives objectively based on their life experiences. It's rare that you and your friend will come from the exact same background, family upbringing, or culture. So understanding baseline differences—and accepting them—is key for offering support and learning more about the people around you. It will help strengthen other friendships, too. New studies have shown that women especially have needs for other women in their lives: A University of Michigan <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/our-gender-ourselves/201404/friendships-between-women-have-health-benefits\">study<\/a>&nbsp;found that when women feel emotionally close to other women, their bodies produce more progesterone, boosting mood and alleviating stress—a handy survival kit if ever there was one.<\/p><p><strong>3. Loyal friends do not do 'conditional' friendships.<\/strong><\/p><p> Conditional, the opposite of unconditional, is based on contractual interaction. You read that right. A contract states, 'I do this for you, if you do this for me.' This does not apply in loyal friendships. Payback is not necessary, nor expected. If you are&nbsp;willing to sacrifice, that should be&nbsp;your decision—one you have&nbsp;willfully chosen to give unconditionally, without expectation.<\/p><p><strong>4. Loyal friends have boundaries.<\/strong><\/p><p> Loyalty is not equivalent to becoming a wet blanket. Abuse and misuse of loyalty for one's gain over another is a clear red flag that your loyalty might&nbsp;be hurtful rather than helpful. A loyal friend might be a friend through any circumstance, but personal responsibility and self-care should always come first.<\/p><p> \"Loyalty is seen as a virtue—albeit a problematic one,\" defines the <em><a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/loyalty/\">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/em>What makes it problematic? lf a friend is so loyal that she'll stop at nothing to tell you how she feels. For example, it's one thing for your best friend to express concerns about your new boyfriend. But if she completely trashes the guy without even getting to know him, she may have crossed a line—even if she had the best intentions at heart.<\/p><p> If you feel like boundaries have been crossed, \"You need to explicitly let her know when she has overstepped them,\" says&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-friendship-doctor/201201/shes-too-much-friend-without-boundaries\">Irene S. Levine<\/a>, Ph.D. \"It is perfectly appropriate to remind her that you have responsibilities to others and to yourself. Clarify how much contact and what type of contact feels comfortable for you to have with her.\"<\/p><p> If you feel like you didn't quite measure up to these, don't be discouraged. Like all virtues, loyalty is a practiced trait. Striving each day to be a loyal friend is worth the effort, for both you and those whom you love.<\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202400125ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202400125ce","primaryImageId":"ci01cec0d300012a83","path":"/2014/09/loyal-friend","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01cec0cca00099de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d3300699de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d11000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa70009512"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202400125ce"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d3300199de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d1d0012a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa700499de"}],"socialPopularity":222,"cardTypeCode":"","slug":"loyal-friend","contentNodeId":"cn01cec0d32000efe2","authorProfile":{"$ref":"ci01cec0ca300099de"},"teaser":"Make the great virtue of loyalty a part of your own life.","promoTitle":"4 Traits of a Loyal Friend We Could All Learn From","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":18.4584,"lastCount":15},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"facebook":{"acceleration":7.4147e-13,"velocity":0.0000106663,"estimate":216.65199248720296,"lastCount":204},"disqus":{"acceleration":1.14899e-28,"velocity":2.11524e-21,"estimate":3.0000000000005107,"lastCount":3}},"dek":"Make the great virtue of loyalty a part of your own life.","migrationId":"21683","ownerId":null},{"isPromoted":false,"authorProfileId":"ci01cec0a990042a83","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2015-11-24T10:00:00Z","sectionIds":[["ci020b7202400125ce"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01de3b509000efe2","objectType":"ContentArticle","isNoindex":false,"title":"Advice from Women Who Have Mastered the Art of Meeting New People","primaryImage":{"height":600,"cloudinaryVersionId":1448310421,"defaultCaption":"","id":"ci01de63315001c80a","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"GetOutThere.jpg","primaryPhotoId":"ci01de63315001c80a","width":900,"publicId":"MTM0NjU0MTAyMDQ1OTkzNjAz","format":"jpg","bytes":91458},"isSponsored":false,"editedTimestamp":"2015-11-24T16:59:35Z","disqusId":"3f11983c-90a4-11e5-b038-001ec9b40b46","autoSaved":false,"tmlEmbeds":[],"sectionsLeafNode":["ci020b7202400125ce"],"bodyTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>I’ve moved a fair number of times in my life, which means the hardest of transitions: finding new friends. It also means that I’ve come to despise one of the most annoying bits of advice:&nbsp;“Get out there.”&nbsp;(Second only to the all-time obnoxious winner,&nbsp;“When&nbsp;you know, you know,”&nbsp;but that’s another article altogether.) When it comes to&nbsp;“getting out there,”&nbsp;I’m not exactly a hermit. I take the train to work, go out on the weekends, grab brunch with friends—still, the art of meeting new people remains elusive to me.<\/p><p>I’m certainly not alone in this struggle. It can be so much easier to invite my BF over and binge watch Netflix on a cold winter night. The good news is, I know plenty of women who are pros at putting themselves out there and have reaped the rewards. Whether you are in that weird post-college, post-move, post-marriage, post-baby, or post-breakup transition or are simply prone to becoming a wintertime recluse, stop wondering how in the world to meet new people, and just start doing it! Here are tips from women who know a thing or two about “getting out there.”<\/p><h2>01. Take risks<\/h2><p>“When I moved out to Colorado, I didn’t know anyone,” Katherine tells me. “I assumed that because I work in a hospital, and there are usually young people working there, I’d have no trouble making friends. But that’s not how things worked out. I was surprised by how isolated you can be in a city,” she says.<\/p><p>Four years later, however, Katherine loves Colorado and has a vibrant social life. How? For starters, she is constantly looking for ways to meet new people. From <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/\">Meetups<\/a> and volunteering to travel, Denver (and the world) provide endless horizons for forging new connections.<\/p><p>“I think the first key to my making friends was just taking the risk of reaching out to people I didn’t know,” Katherine says. “One day I decided that if I saw anyone that looked slightly normal and nice at church, I was going to introduce myself. It was one of the hardest things I have done but also the most rewarding.”<\/p><p>For my friend Erica, travel taught her a lot about talking to new people. She got good at it while backpacking through Europe for six weeks. Now Erica makes conversation—and new friends—everywhere she goes.<\/p><p>“I made an effort to talk to people in line wherever I was standing,” Erica explains. “I found that most people were excited to talk once the ice was broken. You could talk about anything: what croissant they were going to get, how the weather was outside, where they were from. The options are endless.”<\/p><p>Katherine says that it takes a bit of vulnerability to let the person know that you would like to make friends. Katherine says that after the church ceremony she spotted a friendly-looking girl and introduced herself. “I told her I was new and didn’t know anybody and asked her a few questions,” Katherine recalls. “She got my number and invited me to a few group things. From there, I met a lot of people, who four years later, I’m still friends with.”<\/p><p>Speaking of risks, according to Katherine, “getting out there” often means showing up solo, which is intimidating for anyone.<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">“I said yes to events, house parties, etc. where I didn’t know anybody,”&nbsp;she says.&nbsp;“Sometimes I didn’t even know the host. It was hard and awkward at times, and I had to force myself to go, but you just have to embrace the awkwardness!”<\/p><h2>02. Pursue Your Interests<\/h2><p>Every time I talk to my friend Meg, she is doing something exciting and new. It’s truly an inspiration for a routine-loving person like me. Most recently she ran a marathon in Alaska. She says:&nbsp;“Ask yourself: <em>D<\/em><em>o I enjoy what I do on the weekend? Or am I just clinging to what is comfortable? <\/em>It might be that you need to change that and really figure out what you want to do with your time. You only live once, so make the most of it!”<\/p><p>Volunteering is a great way to meet people, and Katherine says she does a lot of it in order to feel more a part of her community. “I stalked the Craigslist volunteer section when I first moved to Denver and still sign up to volunteer frequently, hoping to meet fun people.” <\/p><p>But volunteering doesn’t have to mean donning a hairnet and hitting the soup kitchens. “It’s nice if you’re volunteering for something that you’re interested in because you are more likely to meet people with common interests,” Katherine explains. “For example, this weekend I’m volunteering at a ski camp. I love skiing, so I figure there will be other volunteers who like skiing, too.”<\/p><p>Trying new things keeps you active and enthusiastic about life, but it also puts you in front of new people with similar interests. Meg suggests making a list of new things you want to try.&nbsp;“Set a deadline for your list,”&nbsp;Meg urges.&nbsp;“You’ll meet new people that way.”<\/p><p>At the beginning of each month, search the Internet for cool classes, volunteer opportunities, and destinations you would like to visit, and then lay out a plan for making it happen. My fiancé and I have made a commitment to learn one new thing every year after we are married, in an effort to stay&nbsp;“out there.”&nbsp;This will mean taking&nbsp;classes and hopefully meeting new people in the process.<\/p><h2>03. Be Approachable<\/h2><p>Having a&nbsp;“<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2014/11/resting-b-face\">bitchy resting face<\/a>”&nbsp;is not an excuse when it comes to getting out there. Don’t let your unintentional habits keep you from seeming like a great person to get to know.<\/p><p>Living in eight different places within the span of three years--from Virginia to Tennessee to Afghanistan to D.C., just to name a few--Megan knows what it feels like to be in need of companionship.&nbsp;“Be approachable,”&nbsp;she advises.&nbsp;“Being new is&nbsp;already&nbsp;awkward and uncomfortable; it’s easy to come across as reserved/shy or guarded, but it’s OK to make eye contact and smile.”&nbsp;It takes effort to  resist the urge to withdraw or appear disinterested in an uncomfortable situation, but this is the key to making conversation and friends with people you might not otherwise meet.<\/p><p>Katherine also chimes in here, encouraging us not to&nbsp;“hide behind our phones.”&nbsp;There is nothing that conveys disinterest in others like scrolling through Facebook in a social setting.&nbsp;If you’re feeling out of place at an event, don’t use technology as a crutch. Branch off, and strike up a conversation. “It’s good to force yourself to talk to new people,”&nbsp;she says.<\/p><h2>04. Follow Up<\/h2><p>According to Katherine, the key to making new friends is to follow up. Taking the risk of introducing yourself is not enough. “If you meet someone new, and they seem nice, follow up with them, and plan something sooner [rather] than later,” she says. If your new acquaintance is not on the hunt for friends, you may fall off their radar when they are planning events or outings. It’s not personal.<\/p><p>Sometimes the timing is bad, and your schedule makes it difficult to get together soon after first making someone’s acquaintance. That’s OK, but you still need to make a point to follow up. “If I exchange contact info, I’ll send a message that says something like:&nbsp;‘It was great to meet you. My next week is really busy, but I’d love to get together when things settle down,’”&nbsp;Katherine says. “That way it’s not weird if you message them two weeks later.”<\/p><p>Erica once found that a little follow-through goes a long way. “I was feeling really sleepy on this particular day, so I asked the guy next to me on the train if he wouldn’t mind making sure that I didn’t fall asleep past my stop. That turned into us talking the whole trip. I found out he had just moved to the U.S. from Russia and was a jazz musician. I wasn’t interested in him romantically after our conversation, but I could tell that he was a really nice human. We exchanged numbers, and a few weeks later it dawned on me that he might not have anywhere to spend his first Thanksgiving. I invited him to my <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/11/thanksgiving-friendsgiving-festive-foods-potluck-healthy-recipes\">Friendsgiving<\/a> where we had a progressive dinner in our apartment building.

Fast-forward to adulthood—and making new friends (while keeping the old ones) is, well, hard. You no longer live in a dorm where you can socialize nightly. You’ve most likely moved to a new city with no roots. Piles of&nbsp;laundry, meals to cook, and an apartment to keep clean are all part of the balancing&nbsp;act. Fit in a significant other, family obligations, and working overtime, and&nbsp;it's no wonder&nbsp;your social life may slack.<\/p><p> You are not alone if you've felt difficulty (and frustration) when it comes to making friends. How&nbsp;do you even begin? Friendships, like any relationship, take time, effort, and investment&nbsp;you might not have. But forming friendships&nbsp;is an integral part of human existence and identity. In fact, our biology makes it easy for us! Our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://news.virginia.edu/content/human-brains-are-hardwired-empathy-friendship-study-shows\">brains<\/a> are hardwired for empathy and friendship, and our identity as humans is largely based on who we know and feel close to.<\/p><p> More good news: All that day-to-day&nbsp;stress actually helps your friendships.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.anapsid.org/cnd/gender/tendfend.html\">Stress<\/a> triggers a higher release of oxytocin (the bonding hormone) in women than men,&nbsp;and it triggers them to draw nearer to other women rather than a flight-or-fight response.&nbsp;You can thank your primal ancestors for this coping mechanism.<\/p><p> While making friends in the adult world is difficult, it is not impossible. Try these&nbsp;tips and strategies to help you connect with your girlfriends, old and new alike.<\/p><p><strong>01. Connect with old friends—in new ways.<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n Spending time in person just might not be an option for you (or her) these days.&nbsp;Distance or dating may be to blame, but that doesn't mean your friendship can't evolve,&nbsp;says Irene Levine, Ph.D., the \"friendship doctor\" for <em>Psychology Today<\/em>. (She&nbsp;also runs a popular blog on female friendships called <a href=\"http://www.thefriendshipblog.com\">The Friendship Blog<\/a>.) Moving can be <a href=\"http://www.thefriendshipblog.com/why-do-some-women-have-such-hard-time-making-friends-nature-or-nurture/\">detrimental<\/a>, if you let it. Develop rituals with your friends utilizing technology, like&nbsp;G-chat or a quick FaceTime while you’re both watching \"Say Yes to the Dress.\" Or try&nbsp;online shopping together, especially if it's an activity you would do in person: Talk on&nbsp;the phone while spending time on the same site, and send links to each other before you buy anything.<\/p><p><strong>02. Friends at work, works.<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n Office friendships can be tricky, but if you spend more than eight hours a day with your coworkers, there are benefits to befriending some of them. <a href=\"http://getlifeboat.com/goodies/report2013/\">One in three<\/a> American adults have met one of their closest friends at work. And this correlates with job satisfaction. A&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/strategicconsulting/163007/state-american-%20workplace.aspx\">2012 Gallup poll<\/a> found that 50 percent of respondents who said to have a best friend at work&nbsp;felt more connected to their company, compared to only 10 percent who claimed to not have&nbsp;a best friend.<\/p><p><strong>03. Go on a double date.<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n In a relationship? Utilize date night to strengthen your romantic relationship as well&nbsp;as your friendships. A new study from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology&nbsp;found that being on a double date—whether it's dinner out or at home—allows for&nbsp;more intimate conversation. An added bonus: Couples reported an increase in passion in their relationship because they learned more about each other.<\/p><p><strong>04. Be positive.<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n Attraction and friendship go hand in hand. You have to get someone interested in&nbsp;you to develop a relationship, says Judith Orloff, MD, author of<em><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/judith-orloff-md/positive-attitude_b_1948718.html \">Emotional&nbsp;Freedom: Liberate Yourself from Negative Emotions and Transform Your Life<\/a><\/em>. Positive&nbsp;people attract positive people. So what does it mean to be positive? According to&nbsp;Orloff, these traits include:<\/p><p>-Commitment to developing compassion towards themselves and others, and having an&nbsp;open heart<br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n -Courage about following their dreams<br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n -Authenticity&nbsp;and believing in themselves, even when externals are crumbling<br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n -Awareness of their flaws and&nbsp;trying to work on them<br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n -Willing to learn from mistakes<\/p><p> So take heart! With a little time and extra effort, you can make new—and lasting—friendships, no matter your age.<\/p><p> Photo by Shannon Lee Miller<\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202400125ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202400125ce","primaryImageId":"ci01cec0ca5002efe2","path":"/2014/07/the-art-of-friendship-in-the-adult-world","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa10022a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa700499de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa70009512"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202400125ce"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0ae600299de"}],"socialPopularity":243,"cardTypeCode":"","slug":"the-art-of-friendship-in-the-adult-world","contentNodeId":"cn01cec0ca7000efe2","authorProfile":{"$ref":"ci01cec0ca300099de"},"teaser":"It's harder to make friends in the adult world, but these strategies will help.","promoTitle":"4 Tips For Making New Friends (and Keeping the Old Ones) As An Adult","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":-7.6576e-15,"velocity":3.37052e-7,"estimate":129.97446449325818,"lastCount":129},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"facebook":{"acceleration":7.56719e-15,"velocity":8.32004e-8,"estimate":169.109,"lastCount":113},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":1.52769,"lastCount":1}},"dek":"It's harder to make friends in the adult world, but these strategies will help.","migrationId":"18885","ownerId":null},{"authorProfileId":"ci01cec0ca300099de","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2014-08-26T08:30:41Z","sectionIds":[["ci020b7202400125ce"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0d1900199de","objectType":"ContentArticle","terms":[{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa70009512"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0cca00099de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d1d0012a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d11000efe2"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:38:18Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0d190022a83","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"ask advice","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:38:18Z","disqusId":"f0c59de4-fd06-11e4-8a5a-001ec9b1277e","path":"/tag/ask-advice/","slug":"ask-advice","displayName":"ask advice"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa700499de"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:27:38Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0a9a00199de","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"advice","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:27:38Z","disqusId":"7381603a-fd05-11e4-acb1-001ec9b11f53","path":"/tag/advice/","slug":"advice","displayName":"advice"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:38:21Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0d1d0009512","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"asking advice","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:38:21Z","disqusId":"f2b5ae96-fd06-11e4-9201-001ec9b1277e","path":"/tag/asking-advice/","slug":"asking-advice","displayName":"asking advice"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:38:22Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0d1e000c80a","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"giving advice","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:38:22Z","disqusId":"f3997220-fd06-11e4-a06f-002219604568","path":"/tag/giving-advice/","slug":"giving-advice","displayName":"giving advice"}],"isNoindex":false,"title":"Should You Seek a Friend’s Guidance?

According to a Purdue University <a href=\"http://faculty1.coloradocollege.edu/~afenn/web/EC303_8_04/FALL07/READINGS/Bonaccio%20Dalal%20Literature%20Review%20Advice%20taking.pdf\">study<\/a>, there are serious benefits to getting a second opinion. Friends can help you understand your options more clearly and provide helpful&nbsp;perspective when you're making a difficult decision. But, as we sometimes learn the hard way, just because she is your&nbsp;friend doesn't mean that she is the perfect pick for guidance about your issue.&nbsp;So how do you choose who to go to for guidance?<\/p><h3>01. She has been through something similar.<\/h3><p> Who better to talk to than someone who has been through exactly what you are dealing with? She can offer advice on what you could do—and what you shouldn't do—based solely on her firsthand experience (and mistakes). So if your friend is open to divulging, take her up on it. According to <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/do-the-right-thing/201407/giving-people-advice-rarely-works-does\">one psychologist<\/a>,\"Research suggests that while people will resist unsolicited advice and instruction, they will follow the behaviors of others—especially when there appear to be good and reinforcing outcomes from these behaviors (or beliefs).\" Translation:&nbsp;You can learn a lot&nbsp;from your friend's past behavior.<\/p><h3>02. She has the same values.<\/h3><p> Do your life philosophies match up? If you see the world the same way, then it's more likely that this&nbsp;person can offer relevant advice. Seek counsel&nbsp;from someone who sees things eye-to-eye, whether that be spiritually, morally, or emotionally. \"Good advice is true,\" writes Heidi Grant Halvorson, Ph.D. And&nbsp;if the advice rings true to your core beliefs, this friend is probably a&nbsp;secure and solid source.<\/p><h3>03. She asks you questions.<\/h3><p> This first would require your friend to listen—intently. A friend who completely agrees with everything you are saying might not want to ruffle your feathers or fears making you upset—but if you make it clear you want her honest opinion, she should spill. Your friend should offer challenging or thought-provoking questions—ones that, you guessed it, aren't&nbsp;sugar-coated. Sometimes a friend <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/201004/what-is-the-best-way-give-advice\">is the most helpful<\/a> when she&nbsp;tells you about options you might not have thought about already.<\/p><h3>04. She doesn't tell you what to do.<\/h3><p> Your friend should offer advice based on her opinion. She knows that by telling you her thoughts, you have the choice to do (or not do) what she suggests. Such&nbsp;is the joy of advice: You can choose to take it or leave it. If your friend gets&nbsp;upset with you for questioning or even (gasp!) choosing to go against her input, this should be a red flag. As Joni E. Johnston, Psy.D., <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-equation/201005/hey-dear-abbies-three-things-consider-you-give-advice\">explains<\/a>:<\/p><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p>\"Let go of the outcome. Reassure your friend that you’ll be there for her no matter what she decides. If she makes a bad decision, let it go. Trying to rescue her would just be offering unsolicited advice and will likely do your relationship more harm than good.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><h3>05. She trusts you—because ultimately you must trust yourself.<\/h3><p> It's up to&nbsp;you to make the final call and accept&nbsp;the outcomes of your decision. Own your power—you are your best judge! Your friend should know and encourage you in this. We often ask for advice from others because it takes some of the pressure off of ourselves. But&nbsp;playing the martyr or victim card will only stunt your personal growth. Regardless of how close you are with this friend, you are two different people. And that's a good thing.<\/p><p> So reach out to friends, but always remember&nbsp;that you are your best judge. Believe you can make the right call for yourself. And if not, wait. Trust that you will know when to make your move.<\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202400125ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202400125ce","primaryImageId":"ci01cec0d170029512","path":"/2014/08/how-to-know-whether-to-seek-your-friends-guidance","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa70009512"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0cca00099de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d1d0012a83"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202400125ce"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d11000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d190022a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa700499de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0a9a00199de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d1d0009512"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d1e000c80a"}],"socialPopularity":25,"cardTypeCode":"","slug":"how-to-know-whether-to-seek-your-friends-guidance","contentNodeId":"cn01cec0d1900199de","authorProfile":{"$ref":"ci01cec0ca300099de"},"teaser":"There can be some serious benefits to seeking a second opinion.","promoTitle":"Should You Seek a Friend’s Guidance?

I couldn't decide -- was this idea<em> absolutely brilliant<\/em>, or really cheesy?<\/p><p>It's a question that came to mind again while I was listening to Pandora Radio the other day. My work-friendly Chopin station threw me a <a href=\"http://www.pandora.com/christopher-oriley/hold-me-to-this-christopher-oriley-plays-radiohead/no-surprises?shareImp=true\">curveball<\/a>. Is that Radiohead I hear, or have I been drinking too much coffee? It's Radiohead alright; those chiming sounds of \"No Surprises\" are unmistakable.<\/p><p>The song came and went, and days passed. But I couldn't get it out of my head: How can I hear that Chopin-esque 90s classic again? Poking around for it online, I found another Chopin Pandora listener who chanced across the song and was <a href=\"http://twitter.com/andrewasalways/statuses/205767555418304512\">not as amused<\/a>:<\/p><blockquote><p><\/p><p>No alarms and no surprises, please.

Out of every female in the bride's life, she chose you. And you want to help her big day go as smoothly as possible. Follow these tips to become the best maid of honor she could ask for.<\/p><p><strong>01. Talk to the bride up front about what she wants you to do pre-wedding.<\/strong><\/p><p> Modern weddings don't necessarily follow standardized rules of etiquette about specific maid of honor responsibilities. So go ahead and be a straight shooter when it comes to what she expects from you. Would she like you to plan the bachelorette party? Host a bridal shower? Just show up to the wedding? Knowing what the bride thinks of your maid of honor duties will put both your mind and the bride-to-be's at ease. Talk it out.<\/p><p><strong>02. Make checklists with her.<\/strong><\/p><p> She probably already has a huge to-do list started for her wedding planning, but she needs an outlet for the billions of ideas flying around in her mind. Having someone to bounce ideas off of falls to you, so help her organize her thoughts and check things off from that long list. Take the time to think of the little things that will probably slip her mind. For example, if you know the bride can be a bit forgetful on a normal day, you can go so far as creating a packing checklist for her honeymoon—she is probably too busy to remember she'll need her toothbrush.<\/p><p><strong>03. Prep an emergency pack for the wedding day.<\/strong><\/p><p> What could go wrong? Oh, just about anything. Be prepared with a few essentials: sewing kit, mints, deodorant, double-sided tape, ibuprofen, tissues, water bottles, Band-Aids, scissors and snacks. One of the biggest wedding-day emergencies is her blood sugar crashing. Pack easy snacks, like granola bars or a bottle of orange juice. Think no-mess, no-fuss.<\/p><p><strong>04. Calm her nerves.<\/strong><\/p><p> The wedding day is go time. Minutes before the ceremony, you're often tucked into a back room for hiding. Take this time to reassure her that you're confident in your ceremonial duties—you will make sure her gown is adjusted, you'll grab her bouquet when needed, etc. Pray with her. Make her laugh. Reminisce.<\/p><p><strong>05. Draft a killer speech.<\/strong><\/p><p> There are many philosophies about giving a good MOH speech; ultimately you have to find a style where you feel comfortable. We've heard our fair share of disaster speeches over the years, but there have been some real winners as well. The best ones seem to remember that this is not the time to be a comedian. Hold off on any embarrassing stories (no one needs to remember all the boys the bride dated before!), and keep the focus squarely on the couple. Talk about what an amazing person the bride is, draw in a great story about the couple and why you're excited for their future together, and end on a happy note.<\/p><p><strong>06. Snap pictures.<\/strong><\/p><p> Sure, she probably has a photographer capturing her every move. But you may have insight, access, and angles that the professional does not. As long as it isn't distracting, taking discreet pictures can be a sweet way to help document the bride's special day. And you can use these photos for a sweet post-wedding gift.<\/p><p><strong>07. Be the first on the dance floor.<\/strong><\/p><p> Shy wedding guests? Break the ice, and bust a move. This small gesture will reassure the bride that her guests are enjoying themselves and that the DJ was not a colossal waste of money. When the guests see you on the floor (you may want to drag someone else out, too), they will pick up on the cue.<\/p><p><strong>08. Plan to be her runner post-wedding.<\/strong><\/p><p> The wedding is over, and she's off on her honeymoon! But wait, what about her dress? Shoes? The groom's tux? They won't be needing those items on their honeymoon. Most often the bride and groom will have a night before they jet off, so be prepared to pick up her possessions the next day. Discuss where she would like you to drop everything off.<\/p><p> Yes, being a maid of honor is a big deal for you, but at the end of the day, it is so much more than that. Being maid of honor is an opportunity for you to serve your friend in a unique and selfless way. If your attention is focused on your friend, any maid of honor business is bound to be a success.<\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202400125ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202400125ce","primaryImageId":"ci01cec0f590022a83","path":"/2015/04/traits-of-a-good-maid-of-honor-weddings-marriage-planning","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01cec0f5c000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0f5b000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202400125ce"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa70009512"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa700499de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0c440012a83"}],"socialPopularity":257,"cardTypeCode":"","slug":"traits-of-a-good-maid-of-honor-weddings-marriage-planning","contentNodeId":"cn01cec0f5a004efe2","authorProfile":{"$ref":"ci01cec0ca300099de"},"teaser":"Being maid of honor is an opportunity for you to serve your friend in a unique and selfless way.","promoTitle":"8 Tips to Be the Best Maid of Honor Your Friend Could Ask For","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":1.17141e-14,"velocity":1.07013e-7,"estimate":165.381,"lastCount":115},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":2.89241,"lastCount":2},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"facebook":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":830.954,"lastCount":140},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0}},"dek":"Being maid of honor is an opportunity for you to serve your friend in a unique and selfless way.","migrationId":"31876","ownerId":null},{"authorProfileId":"ci01cec0b600009512","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2012-07-25T13:55:25Z","sectionIds":[["ci020b7202400125ce"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0cca001c80a","objectType":"ContentArticle","terms":[{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:27:40Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0a9c0022a83","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"marriage","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:27:40Z","disqusId":"74bcf068-fd05-11e4-bed0-00221960550f","path":"/tag/marriage/","slug":"marriage","displayName":"marriage"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-07T19:17:27Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cde76c7000c80a","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Motherhood","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-07T19:17:27Z","disqusId":"b2d4fb90-f4ed-11e4-83b1-001ec9b1277e","path":"/tag/motherhood/","slug":"motherhood","displayName":"Motherhood","promoTitle":"Motherhood"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa700499de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa70009512"}],"isNoindex":false,"title":"Expert Tips to Help You Be There For Your New Mom Friend","primaryImage":{"height":331,"cloudinaryVersionId":1431916615,"id":"ci01cec0cc8005c80a","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"phpGLEkBlAM","primaryPhotoId":"ci01cec0cc8005c80a","hasFaces":false,"width":500,"publicId":"MTMwMjUzNDIzMjU2OTY3NjQ2","format":"jpg","bytes":27420,"migrationId":"075e6503148dbcbbb7413c256507d1b620605fb3"},"isSponsored":false,"editedTimestamp":"2016-12-28T16:07:56Z","disqusId":"7b8894ad-8c47-5b30-9561-3af5a51cab2d","autoSaved":false,"tmlEmbeds":[{"$ref":"ci01cec0cc8005c80a"},{"altText":"chill out music","height":14,"cloudinaryVersionId":1431916261,"defaultCaption":"chill out music","id":"ci01cec0b6600299de","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"guestpost_by","primaryPhotoId":"ci01cec0b6600299de","hasFaces":false,"width":24,"publicId":"MTMwMjUzMzI4NDk5MTQyNjI2","format":"png","bytes":343,"migrationId":"8c88346e7b80630af6e150361084a67439b48db7"},{"altText":"chill out music","height":46,"cloudinaryVersionId":1431916263,"defaultCaption":"chill out music","id":"ci01cec0b68001efe2","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"guestbio","primaryPhotoId":"ci01cec0b68001efe2","hasFaces":false,"width":500,"publicId":"MTMwMjUzMzI4NzY3NTU0ODM0","format":"jpg","bytes":16196,"migrationId":"6512195e510705223b607a5635dc3c064700f035"}],"sectionsLeafNode":["ci020b7202400125ce"],"bodyTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n Our bestie.

What's a single girl to do?<\/p><p> New moms need their girlfriends like never before. Friendship makes pregnancy and motherhood more fun and a strong support network is one of the best ways to protect the mother and baby’s health by helping to prevent post-partum depression.<\/p><p> So, although it can be tricky to navigate friendship during big life transitions, Kathleen Kendall-Tackett, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Depression-New-Mothers-Consequences-Alternatives/dp/0415778395/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343164882&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=depression+in+new+mothers\">Depression in New Mothers<\/a>, outlines the important ways a community of friends can support new moms:<\/p><p><strong>Value the weeks after the baby is born as much as the pregnancy<\/strong>. Pregnant women spend months being pampered, but that first-class treatment often ends after the baby is born. Rally to her side and help the new mom set aside these first few weeks as distinct and special. Make sure someone is at home with her during the day or try setting up a schedule for other friends to come for a visit.<\/p><p><strong>Make sure she’s important, too<\/strong>. No matter how excited you are to see the baby, always greet your friend first. When you bring the baby a gift, bring something small for her too — even if it’s just grocery store flowers or a gourmet cupcake. Baby blues or post-partum depression may be aggravated by feeling ignored.<\/p><p><strong>Lend a helping hand<\/strong>. Don’t play with the baby and leave your friend washing the dishes! Clear up after dinner. Water her plants. Offer the gift of time to your friend so she can focus on her newborn.<\/p><p><strong>Don’t ask<\/strong>. Most new moms are desperate for help, but reluctant to ask for it or even accept it when you offer. Instead of asking, “What can I do?” bring over a dinner to share. Do her laundry. Here's where those years of friendship can help - you know what she likes!<\/p><p> It might seem like a new mom is moving to a new stage of her life, but she won’t want to leave her girlfriends behind. Sharing in the joys and trials of pregnancy and new motherhood is just another step in a meaningful friendship between mature, adult women. Be there for her as a best friend on whom she can truly rely.<\/p><p><strong>How have you been able to help your friends through major life changes?
