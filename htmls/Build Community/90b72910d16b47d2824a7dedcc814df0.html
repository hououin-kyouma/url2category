      <p><strong>“Always be mindful of the kindness and not the faults of others.” ~Buddha</strong></p> 
      <p>Would you like to have more friends? I mean true friends—people who laugh and cry with you.</p> 
      <p>My close friends mean the world to me. They are there for me when I need them. When they’re on a high, I celebrate with them; when they fall, I help them up again. My life is so much richer because of my friends.</p> 
      <p>But it hasn’t all been an easy ride. For example, one of my best friends is my ex-husband. It took years of work to move through heart-ache, anger, grief, and resentment in order to find the strong friendship we have now. To create a true friendship takes a lot of effort and dedication.</p> 
      <p><em>A friend is one to whom one may pour out all the contents of one’s heart, chaff and grain together, knowing that the gentlest of hands will take and sift it, keep what is worth keeping and with a breath of kindness blow the rest away. ~Arabian Proverb</em></p> 
      <h3>How I Lost a Heap of Fake Friends (and Gained a Few True Ones)</h3> 
      <p>In the past, I learned a hard lesson about friends. I was a professional musician at the time and Director of one of the oldest and most renowned music schools in Australasia. My life seemed to be going fine: I was in a good marriage, had great job with a high public profile,&nbsp; and was a popular friend of many.</p> 
      <p>Or so I thought. Then things disintegrated: I lost my job, and my husband and I separated.<span id="more-11076"></span></p> 
      <p>Suddenly, I had no social standing, and all the people who I thought were my friends disappeared overnight. It was a dark time. Then a couple of people rang me and said they wanted to spend time with me. I asked them, “Why now?”</p> 
      <p>One of them said, “Oh, I’ve wanted to be your friend for a long time now. But I had to wait until you got knocked off your pedestal and came down to earth again!” These people are still staunch friends today.</p> 
      <p>What I learned from that difficult time is that you can miss out on real friendships if you just focus on success. When we are vulnerable, down-to-earth, and modest, it’s easier to attract real friends.</p> 
      <h3>But what is the secret of attracting friends?</h3> 
      <p>It’s not what we <em>do </em>that attracts friends, it’s how we <em>think</em>. If we change how we think about others, we can become a magnet for new friends.</p> 
      <p>It’s seductive to focus on the faults of others. That’s because we often put other people down in the hope of elevating ourselves. But when we focus on what is lovely about others, something magical happens: We begin to feel different about them, and they in turn respond to us in a new, positive way.</p> 
      <p>Here are seven simple tips that will help you to attract new friends:</p> 
      <h4>1. Focus on the good in people.</h4> 
      <p>None of us is perfect. We all have traits that make us difficult to live with. It’s easy to focus on what is difficult. Instead, look for what is good and strong. If you do catch yourself focusing on negative aspects, remind yourself that you too have faults.</p> 
      <h4>2. Smile.</h4> 
      <p>If you look at ancient Buddha figures, they usually show a serene smile. It’s a kind of visual teaching, because when we smile, we become mindful and step out of our preoccupation. No matter how you connect with others, remember to smile. Whether you’re connecting face-to-face, or via Twitter, email, chat, Skype, or phone,&nbsp; your inner and outer smile will be felt by the person you are connecting with.</p> 
      <h4>3. Let go of grudges.</h4> 
      <p>Do you stew over how others have treated you? It can be difficult to release yourself from negative thoughts about how someone harmed you or made you unhappy. Such negative thoughts are corrosive and will harden your heart. So let them go and focus on the beauty of the present moment instead.</p> 
      <h4>4. Be a positive mirror for others.</h4> 
      <p>I you want to be a friend to someone, make sure you let them know all the wonderful things you can see in them. There is a lovely poem by Galway Kinnell that talks about this:</p> 
      <p><em>… sometimes it is necessary<br> to reteach a thing its loveliness,<br> to put a hand on its brow<br> of the flower<br> and retell it in words and in touch<br> it is lovely<br> until it flowers again from within, of self-blessing.</em></p> 
      <p>This poem shows us what it is to be a good friend. We need to reteach our friends their loveliness, in words and in touch.</p> 
      <h4>5. Be helpful.</h4> 
      <p>The key to creating lasting friendships is to think about what you can do for friends. They key question is: what do they need? For example, a friend of mine recently lost her father. At a time like that, help is important. So I’ve been cooking meals for her, just to make things easier and to let her know that I care.</p> 
      <h4>6. Be kind.</h4> 
      <p>My aspiration in life is this: kindness is never out of place<em>. </em>Mind you, I don’t always manage to live up to it. But that’s the nature of aspirations—they are the stars by which we navigate our lives. Though they light up our path, we can never reach them.</p> 
      <h4>7. Be grateful.</h4> 
      <p>It’s easy to take friends for granted. But if you want to strengthen your friendships, do the opposite. Think of your friends with gratitude. And then express your gratitude to them in words and deeds. Everyone loves being valued.</p> 
      <h3>The Six Magic Words That Make Friendships Happen</h3> 
      <p>There are six magic words that make friendships happen. And it doesn’t matter whether the friendships are online or face-to-face. These six words are:</p> 
      <p><strong>“What can I do for you?”</strong></p> 
      <p>Yes, they are magic words. Because they not only touch the heart of others, they also transform our own heart. We begin to let go of an ego-centric view of the world where the main words are <em>I</em>, <em>me</em>, and <em>mine</em>. Instead, we start to appreciate the needs, wants, and hopes of others.</p> 
      <p>Can you think of someone right away who would benefit from the six magic words?</p>

          <p>I’ve one simple way to make friends, even if it’s a stranger. It’s simple. You make friends when your souls meet. Even if it’s a stranger, I talk about things I love. I ask for their opinion. I ask for their help and I appreciate that help. We make friends when we open ourselves to people and let the hearts connect.</p>

          <p>So very applicable! Friends are so commonly taking advantage of because they are always there. They are a cornerstone of life, so as you wrote, when they are not there, those are truly dark times. </p> 
          <p>Focusing on people’s bright spots is such a good practice. You control your awareness – you control your focus. So it comes down to the simple question of what you choose to see in other people?</p>

          <p>What a wonderful and important post. Especially in today’s world, where “friends” have taken on a new and almost insignificant meaning through social media. We can so easily forget to embrace and develop our Real friendships; those that encompass mutuality, intimacy, trust, genuine concern for another.<br> Thank you for this beautiful reminder. </p>

          <p>Great post but what if you’re doing everything you can as a good friend and you repeatedly get friends that bail on you when you needed them most.&nbsp; I have met a lot of people from many paths (free spirits, altruists in every other sense, etc) who have become those type of friends that took advantage of me the most. As I analyze these relationships, I cannot put a finger on even one thing I’ve done wrong except always be there for them and say nice things about them.&nbsp; It seems like most of my now ex-friends were just jealous of my success and popularity and once I hit hard times, they scrambled to take my spot. I used to be open to all kinds of friends and now my experience has just taught me to be wary of friends and to trust enemies more … because at least they are upfront.</p>

          <p>Haha, good point. You really have to connect with the people around you in an organic way or else it won’t work. I think as we get older, we develop a sense for who we can be friends with. The best frienships I’ve had have developed naturally without much effort. Like all relationships, if you have to force it, it probably wasn’t meant to be.</p>

          <p>Really enjoyed this post but the very one thing that I think will transform my life after reading it is this: “Focus on the good in people” it seems simple but I find difficult due to many hurt and disappointments from past friends and experiences. However, this is going to be my new thing, as already thinking of all the good things in those I thought I disliked is already changing my feelings towards them.</p>

          <p>HELLO I just wanted to say thank you so much for doing this for me and many others. At the beginning of the break up I felt like I would never love again and that my life has ended. Thanks to all your advice, I now have the courage to face every new day. My heart has healed tremendously and I feel like I can now really move on. If it wasn’t for your words then I would probably still be in that dark place of my life. Thank you, thank you!”drlawrencespelltemple@hotmail. com</p>

          <p>My suggestion would also to be playful, nothing more attracts people than open minded, happy people. 🙂 I say it from experience of mine, because most of my friends I made here- <a href="http://kur.lt/naktinis-gyvenimas">šokiai</a> and they are the best ones in my life. Try to do the same, maybe it will be strongest friendship of all times 🙂</p>

          <p>My Husband has returned home after many months. No one thought that there was hope. My friends and family urged me to move on and get a divorce. Every time I was close to giving up, I did not feel releasing me from my marriage until when my cousin traduced me to great one baba who helped her when she had problem with her lover. great one baba made the impossible possible within 48hours after I did all that he told me to do. Anytime I feel myself getting frustrated and offended I always contacted great one baba for help. Here is his contact e-mail if you need help too;oselovespelltemple@gmail.com</p>

          <p>It’s best just to find another who appreciates it, where it doesn’t seem like your chasing them anymore. If the friend was really close I could be fine to tell them you misunderstood where your friendship was with them (implying the imbalance, but not making it a big deal). And making new friends to be close with, and having awesome time with them (no need to try showing it online through social media). And if their not completely not selfish and self centered, they will eventually come back. Just don’t completely let them back in, do it slowly if their worth it. </p> 
          <p>But I agree with main article in finding the positives in close friends. But everyone’s circumstances can be quite different. This really can become hard when your striving for more financial success, and already make way more than your friends combined. I’ve learned not to talk about any goods things in my path. And get them talking about themselves while providing good feedback, while enjoying their company.</p>

          <p>What do you do if all your friends left you and you’re not that successful anyway? You don’t earn much and you’re socially isolated? Your co workers are not interested in you because you are 20 years younger than all of them. What would you recommend? </p>

          <p>The main point about this article is to do with offering value to people.This is great, however, there is a big difference between offering value and giving out ‘core’ value. To illustrate, for the average single heterosexual 25 year old guy, one of the things they will want most of all is to find a girlfriend. If I were to introduce him or connect him with someone that would become his girlfriend, you will have given him his ‘core’ value – and consequently he would most likely want to include me in his social life and introduce me to other friends etc. There are loads of other ways I might offer to help him that we would all regard as offering value, but they may not be perceived as valuable to him. Everyone’s core value is different, and it is by each of us understanding what it is we have to offer to people, and finding the people who will highly value our time and resources and offering them to those people, that is what will help us find an abundance of great friends.</p>

          <p>I reckon it is indeed a natural process. i’ve read somewhere that physical contact between good friends creates hormones similar to those created during contact between mother and child. A sense of trust, secracy and safety. Myself i’ve been blessed with quite a few lifetime friends whom i grew up with and know for over 25 years now. The relationship i have with one, truly my best friend can still be a mystery to me. He has a very high EQ, is a visual thinker and is socialy very strong would explain alot. Both having a girlfriend we have less time but we truly miss eachother when we haven’t seen eachother in a while and spending time togheter, giving eachother a hug, holding on for a longer time just because we want sets in motion a certain proces which is benefitial to both as we really feel better, like a battery that gets charged up again. Truly nothing sexual, both going towards 30 and just having shared so many experiences togheter, both joy and painful and always being there for one another has created a almost indestructable bond. Even now we are older, the phsycial contact between friends; those hugs really do give a sense of trust, safety and love which we have been providing each other with for all these years.</p>

          <p>Your comment resonated with me. It’s true you know who your true friends are when you are down. My now ex-friends were anything but friends when I had my share of life struggles. They were worse than enemies. After I got back on my feet, I had no desire to remain friends with them. I only give my time and energy to friends who are sincere and real. If I can say something about being a magnet for friends, it is to be a true friend yourself.</p>

          <p>I have learned that balancing kindness and tolerance with fairness is hard, but also the key. If you always find yourself being told what you all are doing, feeling like you get stiffed on the bill/booze/ or only see them if you have something they want then you are likely not with true friends. If they take the time to ensure you are ok with the plans, and would rather adjust them than have you not included, then they are true friends. Things don’t have to be equal in order to be fair, and seeing the positive in people will enable you to have fair, if not equal, friendships.</p>

          <p>Being kind, helpful, and having a ‘what can I do for you’ attitude is what got me a whole load of fake friends in the first place. In my experience, which has been humbling, being helpful and kind to others attracts users into your life by the bucket load, and they sure as hell won’t be returning that attitude during your hard times.</p>

          <p>I swear to God I’m doing all of this.<br> Ever since I started reading articles on tinybuddha, I’ve become a very grateful, kind person.<br> I’m always happy(at least I try) and I take happiness in life’s smallest pleasures and I would literally run to a friend’s house if they ever needed me, yet I always find friends who seem to disrespect me.</p> 
          <p>I’m friends with none of my friends from school because they always put me down, made me feel worthless and humiliated me. Now I’m almost afraid of making new friends. So even in college, I made a limited number of friends And didn’t put myself out there much.</p> 
          <p>Although, I made a few amazing friends in college I feel like I’m not good enough compared to them when it comes to looks(I feel ugly all the time)and confidence. They make friends so easily and most of them stick. But with me, I feel like I’m replacable. Like I’m not important enough to my friends. I feel like I’ll never fit in perfectly with their new friends. How do I stop myself from being so insecure. </p> 
          <p>Yes, I have been replaced in the past, but whats in the past is in the past. How do I move past that, be more confident and comfortable around my friends and other people and how do I feel secure about my friendships??</p> 
          <p>Thank you in advance 🙂 </p>

          <p>ever since I moved to the USA it has been 3 years without friends or family. I feel so lonely, sometimes I meet new people or even classmates and I meet with them to do HW and school stuff but other than that we don’t do anything and they just ignore me especially when the semester is over. I used to be happy but not anymore. when I see other people having good friends I get jealous. I think the reason why I don’t have friends is because I have never really have friends. I have read some books and lots of articles about how to make friends but they don’t work. I am just afraid that one day I will lost hope in life. more than 7 billion people on earth and no one cares about me.</p>

          <p>Unless you are a part of todays narcississtic world of selfies and trying to attain overnight fame on YouTube, its not easy to find decent normal people to have as friends. Watching Dateline and 20/20 shows how many trusting people become victims of todays self-centered “look at me” society. I personally choose to keep my circle small for safety. I fill my life with hobbies I love to do, music, rescued pets, volunteering – doing things that bring me peace and happiness. </p>

          <p>Have done absolutely all of these tactics with multiple people. Hell, I even tried the positive mirror and refused to let my grudges bother me. Number of friends I lost this year: exactly 1, and it seems like her posse followed after. Number of friends I have left: 0. So yeah, thanks for the help.

          <p>Recently I’ve lost my health and therefore my job (medically retired!) and subsequently my friends! They have either moved away to easier parts of UK or they are too busy living their lives. I rarely have energy to go out in the evenings and everyone is at work on the good days. Because of my health I can never make definite plans. I was there for any person when I was well but now no-one has the time for me! I have friends on line through support groups but I don’ want to talk about my health etc all the time! I need someone who will bring me back to ‘normality’ make me laugh but also be supportive when my illnesses take over my life! So far I’m not having much luck!!</p>

          <p>Life is very, very hard, and very, very lonely. You can believe you have a friend, but when it stops serving their needs and you need something from them, they disappear. I have met a few people who will show up for me when I need them, but they disappear and don’t allow me to be an equal friend to them. Everyone is selfish wanting their own needs met whether it is to be virtuous and admired, or to have sympathy and comfort. But nobody is thinking about anybody but themselves. When it comes down to it human beings are entirely self serving. If it is not convenient or pleasing to them they will be gone. And you don’t get to say anything about it. Love is a fantasy that does not exist in this realm. Mutuality is required for love and humans seem to be incapable of mutuality. Everyhing is competition for power, and control. Being who you are in the presence of another is the surest way to be abandoned and left to handle your own problems, because when you have real problems, you are not focusing all your attention on the other person and their needs, so they have no interest anymore.</p>

          <p> Saying that you care from a distance is utterly meaningless and oh so easy. How can it make any difference in a persons life that some stranger declares “I care,” without that person having any recourse to reach out to you again. Caring is an active thing not just a word. It is sickening in this cold, heartless world to be surrounded by billions of hateful people who misuse words of care and concern to puff themselves up and make themselves feel important, while kicking to the curb a person who is hurting and in need. The world is in the sorry shape it’s in at least in part because self-important people have become commonplace, and think it’s easy to use words to brush people off. Fantasizing about kindness does not create kindness. It creates hate and hurt. Being kind is difficult and requires effort. And saying “I care” in a virtually anonymous Internet post does harm, not good. It is the metaphorical nail in the coffin for human relationships. </p>

          <p>It hurts how right you are. I used to be so positive, always hopeful and seeing the good in others…but the truth of the situation is that people don’t stick around unless they need something from you. If they see you as “superior” to them they cling to you, but if you’re having an off day bye bye they go. It’s a shame we cannot be authentic and we have to put on a brave face and act like everything super duper amazing. I’ve been feeling very lonely and depressed, but of course I cannot tell anyone about it because I know they will shame me for it or act nice and then disappear.</p>

          <p>The pain is real with this one. I’m already losing hope, but post like yours make me realize those of us who feel lonely need to reach out more. There may be many lonely people in your environment, but you would never know because everyone’s ashamed and trying to hide it.</p>

          <p>Friends remain close so long as you things are status quo. If you start getting successful and you are still humble and loving, they start feeling jealous for your achievements and successes. This shows they are not genuine as it should be for better or worse. Jealous is a very power element, to be avoided, when a friend is successful or sorrowful embrace them.</p>

          <p>May work or may not. You open your heart to someone and you may be hurt very badly, when they expose you. Farmiliarity brings contempt at times. So as you open your heart, do it gradually once you have learned the other person and carefully.</p>

          <p>Among the 7 million, I care and I feel your pain. I have gone through it, banking so much on people but after the purpose is fulfilled they go on with life and ignore you. It is very difficult, do not lose hope. My advice is smile a lot when you meet people and engage them in talk and extend your wings to several people, visit several social places, like worship places, gymn, shopping area to widen your social territory, exposure and chances of meeting people. Take contacts, keep in touch, retain some as acquintance, others closer depending on their value. Do not go to them with your problems just be easy with what it going around till you are closer, do not brag if you make success and exercise a free spirit. Find a common interest like a game or sports and chances are that will be the attraction point.</p>

          <p>I know that feeling. I believe it’s important to be a good friend of ourselves BEFORE we start making friendships with others.<br> The steps above are great but I see it as “phase 2”.<br> We can certainly make many people happy many times. But we can NEVER make even a single person happy ALL THE TIME. And we all know what happens when we try to give others more than we give ourselves. In my experience, Practicing to say “no, I won’t do it” , No man, thanks” or “Not me buddy, you are on your own there” are life preserving.<br> I still find it hard to practice with my lover cuz I try to be unconditional and ever forgiving, but I now know what’s better in the long run, for both of us and for our love.</p>

          <p>My practical tips:</p> 
          <p>1) Give priority to long term friends or family who are really close to you “now”.<br> I do not build friendship on kindness (I used to) but on Loyalty.<br> I asked myself “If I have a “true” friend, what would be the single quality in him that I always appreciate?” And my answer was “Loyalty”. He/she will be loyal to me always, will always stand with me, will always do their very best for me and my happiness, because they love me.</p> 
          <p>And I realized I already have few people in my life who matched that description:<br> (that include my cousins, my sister, 3 of my best friends).</p> 
          <p>So they are my priority now. They are family for me. </p> 
          <p>But I wasn’t being the best friend when I had this realization. So I decided to be loyal back to them. I started meeting “their expectations” ( I still try..) and they love me more and more. I give them surprise visits and talk with them every week, ask them how they are and ask about their problems, I use my connections and money to help them in different things, I share fun with them, go for outings with them, encourage them, love them etc etc etc</p> 
          <p>The thing is that these people “already” loved me so much. I just started being more “loyal” to them and their life.</p> 
          <p>And I learned lesson number 2 in friendship: “Loyalty is the only thing matters in real world relationships”.<br> My idea of Loyalty = Make them priority+Be willing to do more than you can to help them+Be proactive in caring+Surprise them by sharing happiness+ No matter what happens, never ever stop caring (apathy is not an option)</p> 
          <p>Mental cue: Think Dominic Toretto. I think of Dominic Toretto whenever I think of being loyal to my friends and family. I also think of one my humble friend who is a very loyal and genuine guy. I learn from both.</p> 
          <p>Btw, lesson number 1 is :”Stay in touch with your internal world and body. And nurture and protect both”</p> 
          <p>I realize that I can’t be loyal to anyone if I’m not being loyal to my own needs. So I take care of my needs. I can write a “WHOLE” another essay on how to take care of ourselves. But I believe it’s better we learn that lesson the hard way ie from feedback from life.</p> 
          <p>This is it. Build loyalty.<br> so my Q: Are you being loyal to anyone now? How loyal are you?<br> Can you become more loyal to anyone who truly loves you?<br> How can you practice loyalty to friends? Who do you want to be loyal to in your life?</p> 
          <p>So when I meet a new person, instead of being good to them, I focus on being loyal to them and their whole life. I give them my honest answers, my ego less self, my emotional strength and my time, my resources.. Ofcourse I can’t do it with everyone I meet. I don’t “need” to do this with everyone I meet. When it comes to friendship and love what matters is quality not quantity. </p> 
          <p>Practical lesson:<br> Try going broke, if you haven’t already, and you’ll learn everything you need to know about friendship.</p>

          <p>Do the hard thing:<br> Tell your coworkers how you feel awkward in that setting. And ask for their advise or suggestions.</p> 
          <p>Example:</p> 
          <p>“Can I be honest about something…? I don’t how to say this. Or what it will make you guys think. Anyway.. I.. I trust you guys.. ok…<br> You know I feel kinda isolated in our office. I don’t know why.. I find it hard to connect with everyone. I want to.. but I find it hard. I think not having many things in common with our guys is a challenge for me. You guys have a lot in common and can talk a lot with each other but I am stuck there..</p> 
          <p>(sigh)<br> What do I do ?! (look down &amp; wonder.)</p> 
          <p>What do I do man?? (look at them and give an embarrassed laugh)</p> 
          <p>My understanding of connection: Don’t try to more than who you are and make you life look more than it is, be open and invite others to see what you are going through, embrace your vulnerabilities and share it and ask for advise and be humble enough to listen to good words and above all “be loyal to good people”.</p>

          <p>hmmm I understand it better now. Thanks for explaining it Kyle.<br> I think I know what you mean. I have also tried to make friends that way. But they were more like “give and take” friendships. (I have nothing against it though). But it’s still wasn’t good enough. So I gave up that strategy.<br> you know.. I have only few close friends but we are really close. But when I think about it I see that life gave me those people. I pretty much did nothing to find them. I just “kept” them with me..<br> And you are right, friendship has new meanings these days. Just staying in contact has become friendship now. And it’s sad.. </p> 
          <p>but I still wanna try and make more friends.. I hope that one day I will be able to create that good old fashioned companionship with many people, not just few.. Maybe it’s a longshot.. but we gotta try,right?</p>

          <p>I think this way of approaching friendship is good for an intuitive person. (IN, EN types if you are familiar with personality types). I’m one.. I totally know how to make connection with other intuitive people. But I “suck” with rational individuals. And I also believe rational people find it hard to use this strategy. If they follow this strategy that’s like a child driving a car on a highway. They would easily get into relationships that’s less than what they deserve.<br> Not everyone resonates with the word “soul”… So I really believe it’s all about learning a lot about ourselves and seeing what kinda people and relationships works for us..</p>

          <p>🙂<br> yeah I can relate to that too. Whenever the “getting old” thought comes into my mind I think about people who are REALLY OLD who would treat me like I’m a child. And I would imagine they telling me “Kid, you have too many years to live on this earth. So stop acting like you are dead. Now get on with your life.. and… visit us sometimes when you have time.:)”</p> 
          <p>Personally I’m in search of a right path for me. I do have a day job but I wanna do something which I’m damn inspired about. So that’s my major “project” right now. And I hope that as I do it, I will come across the kinda people I’m looking for. Also the kinda relationships. “Cliche” I know.. 😛 But what if it works?! 🙂</p> 
          <p>Until then we have atleast mediocre things to enjoy, right Benni? 😀</p>

          <p>What if you do all this anyway, be a good kind happy person, like I am, but then they take advantage of your nature. I thought I had lots of friends, but I don’t not now. I have always reached out to them, they just don’t bother themselves anymore. I’m in my mid 40’s, and its tough meeting new friends. I work part time, have a husband and teenage kids. The friends I thought I had never reach out to me! It makes you feeling like crap. Seems to be out of sight, out of mine for a lot of these friends. They just don’t miss me enough to get in touch, even though I am a kind, thoughtful person. I feel I can’t keep reaching out to them, I don’t know what the answer is, other then we need to find new friends from somewhere, friends who appreciate us for who we are. It shouldn’t be one sided!</p>

          <p>First I met a group of good people. We became friends. But slowly they started ignoring me and when asked they scolded me. Others say move. But is that so easy to do? I’m really hurt too much with their acts. When I’m not suitable among them they could have told me earlier but after one year of our friendship they started pushing me away like a trash.

          <p>I know the feeling that you are talking about. Recently I went out off station. When I came back I asked my friends what happened in school as my exams were going to start. None of them told me anything properly. When the day of exam came they told me this chapter is replaced by this. I asked them why didn’t they told me this before. They said that they thought I knew. I was speechless I thought these people are my friends. When they go out off station or took leave from school I would tell them everything that happen in their absence.<br> Because of them I didn’t get good marks in my tests.<br> I even noticed that they ignored me, even when I didn’t scolded them for telling me the syllabus at last the last moment.<br> I always thought that I have tgw best friends in the world but didn’t thought that they would be the worst.<br> If I ever get a chance I would teach them a class. </p>

          <p>My name is<br> sophy and I am a fashion designer..i want to testify about what prophet odogboo<br> did for me. I have been into serious relationship with a guy and we promised to<br> get married…his family loves me very much especially his mom …and I do support<br> him and his family from my business. 2yrs ago, he came to ask me to lend him<br> 3000. 296 .89 usd to invest into his business I gave him but before I gave it<br> to him I make him sign some undertaken for the money and my lawyer was<br> involved. After the business was progressive I can’t believe Steve changed. He<br> no longer call me or text me.. and when I called, at times, I asked why he<br> didn’t pick ? he finds one excuse to another to tell..8months ago, he told me<br> that he just can’t move on with our relationship again. It’s was like a dream<br> that I’d wish to wake up from but it’s was so real. i informed his mom and when<br> his mom tried to talk to him , he yelled<br> and said to his mom that he has found the love of his life that he wants to<br> marry; she couldn’t help. Some of his friends I knew tried to talk to him but<br> he won’t listen. wife of one of his closest friend has been my friend and she<br> was the one who God use to tell me about prophet odogboo because God knows that<br> I can’t live without him. 3months ago she called me and she gave me this email <a href="mailto:odogboospell@gmail.com">odogboospell@gmail.com</a> to contact. So I contacted him without my problems…he<br> replied and asked of his name and ask me of some things, and again, he mailed<br> back and tell me what to do. As I did what he said everything worked out like<br> magic that I couldn’t explain. And now we are happily married. I am so very<br> happy for this great work of prophet odogboo keep it on sir God bless you…if<br> you need his help pls don’t hesitate you can also contact the above email and his service is very okay…and it’s affordable</p>

          <p>no one actually cares about being friends when you’re an adult unless you can do something for them. that’s not friendship, that’s selfishness. if you don’t make good lifelong friends by 25 through school or work; you’re doomed to be alone forever. i’m 39 now; haven’t gone out with friends in 20 years because i was the child/teen most people picked on and didn’t like. i’ve tried to reach out; mend friendships and leave the past behind… but people don’t care anymore. they make excuses like they don’t have the time…. but then they’ll post about going out with good friends for a weekend, or just hanging out. liars, bullshit spouting liars. I would love to have a small social circle of friends to hang out with and do things with. I don’t; because i’m worthless. There are alot of blogs and articles like this; while all good meaning and well intentioned; they’re worthless.</p>

          <p>hahaha Im still waiting. When I treat others in this way, they run for the hills. When you read through the lines few want genuinity but most want security. The reasons for superficial behaviour is because their realities are too painful and its safer not to divulge truths in case that is seen as a weakness that could go against them. When you are genuine to another, they seek that as a weakness and use you as a stepping stone to climb higher up the hierarchy. You question “whats wrong with me” but in reality, they are the insecure one missing out on a genuine friendship. But you too, are missing out on that quality friendship because it can become a painful waiting game to wait for that one person that you can trust. Its very lonely in such a social world. Im happier being solo because I don’t have to deal with the grief of not knowing who to trust, but it is also lonely and you can’t help feel disappointed that others are too scared to let their guard down to enjoy life and to smell the roses, not worrying about other’s judgemental opinion. Its such a 1st world problem. Poorer country people have to work together as a community, every day, to ensure survival of their loved ones, and to survive for their loved ones. Where the richer countries isolate themselves and have never been more lonelier, they are never happy with what they have got, always wanting to know if the grass is greener on the other side, breaking trust of their loved ones for their own selfish pleasures. Why cant we be happy with what we’ve got and enjoy the people we have in our circle? Life is here to be enjoyed, it goes too quickly to be bubble wrapped from the rest of the world. It can be a beautiful place if we want it to be!</p>
