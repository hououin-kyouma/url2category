               <p><em>By John Lugo-Trebble</em></p> 
               <p>I say this with the love and hindsight of a man on the verge of forty; my younger writer self was a dumbass! I won't mince words here. I was naive, arrogant and a pretentious loner. It's this idea of the "loner" that I took to extremes, which in retrospect was purely self sabotage. I read about writing tribes and brushed them off as hippy hogwash. I didn't need anyone. I had me. I only realised last year when I found my own writing tribe; how wrong I had been.</p> 
               <p>I have written stories for as long as I can remember. My childhood was spent with my head in those black and white marble composition books from Woolworths that I treasured then as I do my moleskin notebooks now. I would scribble for hours, creating worlds that made more sense to me than the one I grew up in. Worlds where a family could afford a typewriter, or that first kiss could be magical instead of awkward. My stories gained some attention although not always positive. My mother did receive a visit from our local Priest, concerned that I was writing about teen pregnancy and suicide at the age of 10--a story my brother is always keen to remind me of whenever we talk about my writing. Honestly, I think it was just a retelling of an afterschool special I had watched.</p> 
               <p><em><strong>I read about writing tribes and brushed them off as hippy hogwash. I didn't need anyone. I had me.</strong></em></p> 
               <p>As a teenager, I carried a notebook around, jotting down those moments and ideas that came to mind when I was out partying.&nbsp;&nbsp;During my last year of college I started my first novel. I was twenty-three when I finished it. It had taken two years, which included two family deaths, and a complete adjustment from living in&nbsp;&nbsp;New York to London; but I was proud! Four hundred and twenty-five pages of youthful idealism. It was going to change the world. I was going to be a hit. All that time spent head down in a notebook was about to pay off. All that time spent dreaming as a kid about being a writer was about to come true.&nbsp;&nbsp;Take that high school guidance counsellor who said I should have looked at two-year technical colleges.</p> 
               <p>It was spectacularly rejected!</p> 
               <p>I still believe that one day that novel will be great but as is, I am the first to admit that the writing is superficial (I was 23), lacking depth (again, 23) and most of all honesty (did I mention I was 23?). That is not to say a twenty-three year old cannot pull off a successful novel, I am saying that I was not one of those.&nbsp;&nbsp;My characters were one dimensional characters, there are plot holes you couldn't jump across and at times its just cringe-worthy.</p> 
               <p>It is easy now with hindsight to admit this, but at the time I was gutted. Correction, I wasn't just gutted; I was destroyed. I put my novel spiral-bound from Kinko's (it was sort of published, right?) into my office cupboard, turned off my desk lamp and immersed myself in the rest of my life with only occasional scribbles here and there for the next eight years. I was working in publishing at the time which only served to remind me daily of my own failure as a writer.&nbsp;</p> 
               <p><em><strong>I was working in publishing at the time which only served to remind me daily of my own failure as a writer.&nbsp;</strong></em></p> 
               <p>I had always held onto this misguided belief that writing is a solitary pursuit. You don't need nor do you want anyone else there. Other people are scary, other writers are weird. I am not like them, I am different. Writers are a bitchy lot who are competitive and out to destroy what little confidence I had. I had barely survived high school. Fuck that! I wasn't about to put myself in that situation again, so I didn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;I spiralled into a hole of "woe is me, Morrissey-esque despair" out of fear. And it was all bullshit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
               <p>When I did emerge from my self-imposed exile, I started taking online courses because the nature of my work and life at the time meant I travelled a lot. I started with&nbsp;<em>One Story</em>&nbsp;classes and fell in love with their model. I am a hands on, get to work practical guy when it comes to courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;This made me seek out other online writing courses to get me back on the horse so to speak. I started to interact online with other writers and share work. Guess what, no one was bitchy to me. Some people even liked my stories. They were supportive in their feedback. Had I been wrong all along?&nbsp;<em>Surely, not! I'm always right!</em></p> 
               <p>About a year ago, out of the blue I was contacted by a fellow classmate about joining an online group of writers. I thought about it, talked myself into it, talked myself out of it and then back into it. I was ready to become part of a community for the first time. I not only found a community of great writers, but a diverse one. We are all at various stages of our own creative successes, but most of all, we are supportive of one another. There is no doubt that having your spouse, friends and family support you make all the difference, but never underestimate the importance and necessity of having the support of your fellow writers; your colleagues.</p> 
               <p>We have created a safe space where we share experiences, survival techniques and support one another which I have mentioned before but want to stress what makes a tribe work.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also share our disappointments, frustrations, fears. The painful rejections we have all received have become starting points for getting up, dusting ourselves off and doing it all over again. We hold one another accountable for meeting deadlines and create challenges that get us to put "words on paper."&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding my tribe has helped me grow as a writer and a person.</p> 
               <p></p> 
               <p><strong><em>...never underestimate the importance and necessity of having the support of your fellow writers...</em></strong></p> 
               <p></p> 
               <p>In the last year, I had my first short stories accepted for publication. I have actively written and produced more material than I have ever done in my life. Some might even say quality material.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken a professional approach to writing. More so, I actually call myself a writer first instead of saying my day job. I feel connected to the writing community at large, something I did not ever think was essential. My tribe is scattered around the globe which means there is always someone online whatever time of day and our virtual communications feel like three dimensional conversations.</p> 
               <p>If you haven't found your tribe, I urge you to seek them out. They are there. They will support your work and share with you coping skills. They will share your disappointments and fears in more than ways than one. They will make you laugh with anecdotes, trade recipes and book/TV/film&nbsp;&nbsp;recommendations. They will help you see things from another angle and if they are anything like mine, they will challenge you to grow as a writer, and to submit so that you get the publishing experience necessary to cope with rejection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejection is a harsh reality we have to face as writers. Sharing that frustration allows you to release it and move on.</p> 
               <p>Be sure to look for local writing groups or meet up events where you live. A quick Google search is sure to yield some surprises and hopefully lead you closer to finding a suitable group. I know that not everyone is lucky enough to have a thriving artist scene nearby or has the time to physically meet up;&nbsp;&nbsp;so seek out online classes. I recommend&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.one-story.com/index.php?page=os" rel="nofollow">One Story</a></em>&nbsp;from personal experience but of course there are many others out there. Make sure you engage with your fellow writers and don't be shy (like I was) to reach out to fellow classmates. Seek out fellow writers in forums. Sign up for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wordtango.com/" rel="nofollow"><em>Word Tango</em></a>, a community of writers by writers. There is a host of different discussion threads and resources. They also run successful and intimate weekend writing workshops which foster a supportive environment to work in.</p> 
               <p>If I had sought out a tribe when I was younger, who knows where I would be today as a writer or perhaps how many books I would have published by now. Truth is though, I was too much of a dumbass to have listened anyway.</p>
