           <div class="entry-content">
            <p>Here it is. My go-to list. (If you’re looking for <a href="http://rebeccasparrow.com/category/resources-for-teenage-boys/" target="_blank">my list of resources for teenage BOYS click her</a>e)</p> 
            <p>I feel like so many parents are feeling anxious and panicked about the world our daughters currently live in. Every day we’re faced with screaming headlines about teenage sex. Binge drinking. Eating disorders. Depression. Risky online choices. ARGH! But let’s not panic. As someone who is regularly in high schools talking to teenage girls — the girls I get to meet are smart and funny and strong BUT that’s not to say they don’t need help navigating this new world we’re in. (I cannot tell you how glad I am that smart phones didn’t exist when I was 14). So what I’ve listed below are just some of the terrific websites, books and docos I would recommend to anyone who has a tween or teen girl in their life. The most important thing I can say to you is that there is no ONE conversation to have with your daughter about online choices (or friendships or sex or whatever for that matter). All of these topics are BIG and it’s about having lots of conversations all the time. Start a running dialogue which includes items in the news, storylines in books or movies or TV shows and other issues that come up day to day. Keep talking. Everything is a “teachable moment”. Think back to what it was like being in high school. And practice listening to your daughter.</p> 
            <p>This list is just a starting point. There are loads of other great books and sites out there. List your suggestions in the comments! And I’ll keep adding to this list too.<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-865" src="http://rebeccasparrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/BiMsRN3CIAAS2fg-300x292.jpg" alt="BiMsRN3CIAAS2fg" width="300" height="292" srcset="http://rebeccasparrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/BiMsRN3CIAAS2fg-300x292.jpg 300w, http://rebeccasparrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/BiMsRN3CIAAS2fg.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p> 
            <p>Here’s to raising strong, smart, fierce girls who refuse to play small ….</p>

            <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA&nbsp;pages for you and your daughter to follow</strong> </em></span></p> 
            <p>Here’s the thing with social media (whatever platform you use Instagram, Facebook etc) is that you need it to work FOR you not against you. &nbsp;If the only people you’re following are friends (or friends of &nbsp;friends of friends!) then you’re mostly just looking from side to side. &nbsp;Make sure your &nbsp;feed is full of people who make you look OUTWARDS. &nbsp;Fill it with people who inspire you, who call forth your best, who remind you of your values or what you stand for or who simply make you laugh. &nbsp;This is about protecting your headspace — &nbsp;so think about curating your feed so that what is given priority are those people and organisations who make you smile rather those who leave you feeling less than.</p>

            <p><em><strong>BOOKS – FICTION for you and your daughter</strong></em><br> My current recommendation are:</p> 
            <p>Take Three Girls by Fiona Wood, Cath Crowley and Simmone Howell. This is a page-turner of the book which deftly handles themes of friendship, identity, bullying and feminism. &nbsp;Girls in grade 9 and over will relate to the storyline of an anonymous rumour-based website targeting (and shaming) local high school girls.<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration: underline;"> <a style="color: #008000; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.booktopia.com.au/saving-jazz-kate-mccaffrey/prod9781925163582.html" target="_blank">Saving Jazz by Kate McCaffrey</a> </span></span>– this is a YA novel which is incredibly powerful about online behaviour, consent and the ramifications of sharing naked images without someone’s consent. It’s blunt and realistic – expect f-bombs but it will speak to many teens. Great to see a novel dealing with the issue of sharing naked images from the point of view of three perpetrators (two male and one female).</p>

            <p>There are two big things I remember about high school: truly ridiculous amounts of homework. And being labelled. Do any of these sound familiar? You’re the sports star or the geek or the loner or the teacher’s pet or the brain or the gossip or the one who is always gossiped about. Or maybe you’re the bully or the loud mouth or the school captain or one of the “choir kids” or a muso or a science-lover or part of the “cool group” or the guy who spends his lunch hours in the library researching Japanese anime or the girl who seems to spend her entire life organising charity cake stalls and fashion parades. Maybe you did something in year nine that people were still talking about in year 12. Or maybe it’s what you <em>didn’t</em> do that set tongues wagging.</p> 
            <p>That can be the problem with high school. It’s like being forced to live in Summer Bay for several years. It seems like <em>everyone</em> remembers <em>everything</em>. The place thrives on rumour and gossip. And it feels impossible to shake off a label once it’s been super-glued to your back. Thankfully this doesn’t last forever. It really doesn’t.</p> 
            <p>&nbsp;</p> 
            <p><strong>The good news: once school ends you get to reinvent yourself</strong></p> 
            <p>Some people – lots of people – feel tortured in high school because of the way they’re perceived or misunderstood, or the reputation (deserving or not) they get stuck with. But here’s the good news;­ whatever label was smacked on your head in high school can be peeled off when you walk out those gates for the last time. Think of it like an Etch-a-Sketch that gets wiped clean. Your reputation gets packed away along with your school uniform and textbooks.</p> 
            <p>See, the great thing about The Rest Of Your Life is that you get to reinvent yourself. And you get to reinvent yourself as many times as you like. A bit like Lady Gaga (except maybe without the meat dress).</p> 
            <p>Here’s an example. A girl in my year 12 class who was seen as Mayoress of Dorktown transformed into this incredibly cool political science student after high school. She went to uni and suddenly found her tribe – other students who were into the same stuff that she liked (the student union, rallies, clever jokes about politicians that no-one else understood). Her new friends were people who couldn’t have cared less that she was always chosen last when we played basketball in high school. At university she found people who liked her for who she was.</p> 
            <p>That’s the thing — many people blossom when they’re given the freedom to be themselves.</p> 
            <p>The great thing about the real world is that all of a sudden you’ll find yourself exposed to new ideas, philosophies and ways of seeing the world. After years of having to wear a uniform, adhere to ‘regulation sock height’ and live by certain school values — you’ll have the freedom to experiment with different looks and ideals. And nobody is going to be hovering by waiting to give you a detention because your fringe is too long.</p> 
            <p>In exactly the same way, whoever you were in high school can also end on that last day of year 12. Maybe you’re not that proud of how you behaved in high school (or the friends you were hanging around) but you felt trapped by a label and continued to play the role of the bully or the socialite or the brainiac. Well the world outside of high school is full of people who don’t know anything about you, so you get to start over. Sort of like being in a witness protection program (okay, not really). But my point is you get to start afresh with a clean slate. Learn from your mistakes. Decide what you want to do differently. Make a decision to be the best version of yourself that you can be and then go for it. It’s never too late to change.</p> 
            <p>Lastly, the great thing about leaving high school is that those people you really, really didn’t gel with — you never have to see them again. Huzzah! Once you’ve graduated you can choose who you’d like to see each day. You can kiss the bullies or the mean girls goodbye (not literally… that could be awkward.). High school ending is really just the beginning of a whole new chapter in your life.</p> 
            <p><strong>The bad news: small fish in a big pond syndrome</strong></p> 
            <p>While some people cannot wait to finish high school, move on and shrug off the labels assigned to them, other students may not be quite so keen to leave their glory days behind. I mean, what if you were school captain? Or voted <em>The Girl Most People Want To Be Stranded on A Deserted Island With</em>? What if you topped Maths or Biology and loved the fact you were the smartest person in your class? Now what?</p> 
            <p>You can really struggle when your environment changes and you no longer have the ‘status’ you had in high school. What I mean is, you become a small fish in a big pond (having spent maybe five years being a big fish in a small pond at high school). Maybe you were the smartest person at your school and now everyone in your first year Science degree is like Sheldon in <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>. Suddenly, nobody thinks you’re special (well, except your Nanna). But try to look at the bright side — the pressure is off you a bit. You can actually relax instead of having to maintain the reputation of always topping Chemistry or English. Or maybe what you were missing in high school was the challenge to push yourself. Suddenly you’re with a whole heap of other smart kids you can learn from. Maybe instead of being made to feel like a freaky genius, you can choose to revel in being around other students who love talking about politics and current affairs and who actually understand nuclear fusion. Accept the difference as a good thing.</p> 
            <p>Or perhaps you were extremely popular in high school and all of a sudden you don’t have an entire school community in awe of you. Maybe at your job, people don’t really notice you or give you any attention the way they did in grade 12. Again, look at the positive. You no longer have the pressure of having to behave in a certain way. Let me get all Dr Phil for a second and remind you that you don’t need to be the most popular person in the room to be happy. If you behave in a way that is kind and friendly, if you demonstrate integrity and compassion and can laugh at yourself — you’ll find your feet. And anyway, the more popular you are, the more people want a piece of you. Enjoy being part of the crowd for a change — sometimes it’s a relief to have no expectations on you.</p> 
            <p>&nbsp;</p> 
            <p><strong>You are not defined by your Year 12 score</strong></p> 
            <p>Finally, let me repeat something I wrote an entire chapter on in <a href="http://www.thekidsbookshop.com.au/find-your-tribe" target="_blank"><em>Find Your Tribe (and 9 other things I <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-834" src="http://rebeccasparrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FIND-YOUR-TRIBE-COVER-223x300.jpg" alt="FIND YOUR TRIBE COVER" width="223" height="300">wish I’d known in high school)</em></a> — your future success does not rely on your year 12 score.</p> 
            <p>For the first few months after high school is finished your friends will probably be <em>obsessed</em> with knowing what score you (and everyone else) received but then they’ll moves on. A great score is fantastic (go you!) but is no guarantee that your life is going to be all ponies, kittens and rainbows. Long-term success is about being resilient.</p> 
            <p>In a similar way, a terrible score doesn’t mean you’re destined to be a failure either. So you bombed out? Okay, that sucks. But if you really want to chase a goal, you’ll find another way to get there.</p> 
            <p>It’s worth remembering that some people are late bloomers. A fabulous example is my friend (and fellow author) <a href="http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?author=Kim+Wilkins&amp;gclid=CNyY2qPx0MMCFQJ9vQod8jMAag" target="_blank">Kim Wilkins</a>. Kim writes:</p> 
            <blockquote>
             <p>“I was a late bloomer in every sense of the word. I still played with my dollhouse in the first year of high school, until one of the other girls told me that it was lame. I was puzzled and sometimes horrified by the things my teenage peers talked about and did. I gained a reputation for being the biggest “dag” in my grade. I flunked almost everything at high school and spent a very long time working in fast food jobs and typing jobs. In fact, I’d say that I didn’t really blossom until my mid-twenties. I went back to school and finished my senior, got into uni, started writing books, and haven’t looked back.”</p>
            </blockquote> 
            <p>&nbsp;</p> 
            <p>Let me tell you, Kim’s being modest. Today she’s an internationally acclaimed author of twenty books. She’s a university lecturer. She’s won a University Medal for pete’s sake. She’s living the life of her dreams. And she flunked out at high school. So if you too bombed out in high school… don’t despair. Tomorrow is another day. Just look at Kim.</p>

            <p>So what did you want to be when you were growing up?</p> 
            <p>I asked my friends this very question over Twitter and received answers as varied as they are themselves. My friend Ally wanted to be a ballerina. With pierced ears. Phoebe wanted to be a bus driver. Jo wanted to own a pet shop purely so she could walk around with a parrot on her shoulder (as you do). My mate Molksy wanted to be a forensic psychologist. Actually he just wanted to be Quincy. &nbsp;Thalia wanted to be a rock star. Anthony wanted to be a superhero. Meanwhile EJ wanted to be on Neighbours so badly she moved to Melbourne when she was seventeen and spent her days loitering around the street where they filmed in the hope of being discovered.&nbsp; Back then EJ called this “being enthusiastic and ambitious”.&nbsp; Now she calls it “being completely delusional and a little tiny bit stalky”.<span class="more-link-ellipsis">… </span><a href="http://rebeccasparrow.com/sunday-mail-south-australia-column-what-do-you-want-to-be-when-you-grow-up/" class="more-link">Continue Reading</a></p>

           <div class="entry-content">
            <p>I remember what this week was like despite the fact it unfolded ten years ago. Okay twenty. Fine, twenty-one if you want to get specific.&nbsp; Twenty-one years ago this week I was facing my final week of high school.&nbsp;&nbsp; My perm and I sat through those last few school assemblies excited and terrified.&nbsp; Ahead of me lay a brand new world. A world where “regulation sock height” was no longer an issue and where I wasn’t expected to like or understand Biology.&nbsp; Or maths. Or PE.</p> 
            <p>As the Class of 2010 prepare to graduate, I thought I’d share three pieces of advice&nbsp; – things I wish I’d known before I walked out of those school gates for the final time.</p> 
            <p>&nbsp;</p> 
            <ol> 
             <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">You Will Not Be A Success Or Failure in Life Based on Your OP Score</span>.&nbsp; I know it’s a big deal. I remember. But the truth is that long-term, your OP score has nothing to do with how successful you will be in life.&nbsp; An OP 1 is no guarantee of anything.&nbsp; You can be the smartest person in the room but if you’re not resilient, if you don’t have the ability to “bounce back” when failure and disappointment strike (and trust me, they’ll strike), then you won’t get anywhere.&nbsp; It’s the people in life who – when they fall down – are able to get back up, dust themselves off and keep going who inevitably achieve their goals.&nbsp; So if&nbsp; — like me — you don’t get the OP score you were hoping for – don’t stress.&nbsp; If you really want to study something, you’ll find a wormhole.&nbsp; When one door shuts, try squeezing through the cat flap.</li> 
             <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Real Life Has Real Consequences</span>.&nbsp; It may not have felt like it but high school is actually a fairly nurturing, safe environment.&nbsp; Real life? Not so much.&nbsp; In the real world – be it in a job or at uni – you face more than a Saturday morning detention if you behave like a bully. Or steal something.&nbsp; Or mutter racist or sexist remarks. And if you go on to further study and choose to spend your days sitting in the Rec Club discussing Mad Men rather than attending lectures – no teacher is going to come looking for you.&nbsp; And your grades will suck.&nbsp; Welcome to life.</li> 
             <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do What You Love.</span> The biggest risk you’ll take is NOT doing what you love.&nbsp; Work takes up a hell of a lot of your life.&nbsp; If you’re studying something purely to please your family, you risk living a second-rate version of your own life.&nbsp; And life’s too short not to feel fulfilled by what you do every day.&nbsp; If you’re not sure yet what it is you want to do – don’t stress either.&nbsp; Pick something. If it doesn’t work out – you get to change direction. You have the right to change your mind.</li> 
            </ol> 
            <p>So Class of 2010, take care. And know that whatever unfolds over the next few weeks, you’ll be just fine.</p> 
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Because it’s Murphy’s Law that when you really need to get a good night’s sleep – you won’t. &nbsp;I’m off to Melbourne today with Brad and Ava to do two days of media for <strong><em>Find Your Tribe</em></strong>. There’ll be some bookstore visits. An interview with the Herald Sun (or Sun Herald … I get confused), an ABC Breakfast Radio thing with Red Symons and a <strong>live appearance on </strong><em><strong>The Circle</strong></em><strong> on Tuesday</strong> (Channel 10, 10-Midday).</p> 
            <p>I think I’m looking forward to <em>The Circle</em> most of all and not just because I know one of the lovely hosts – Ms Chrissie Swan (who is in person exactly how she comes across on the teev: &nbsp;laugh-out-loud funny and utterly genuine). &nbsp;No, I’m a bit of a <em>Circle</em> fan. &nbsp;10am is when Ava goes down for her sleep, so I’ll often put it on and listen to it while I’m writing, emailing, cleaning kitchen, picking food off Buster’s head (thrown there by Ava in her highchair). &nbsp;What I like about it is that the four female hosts have proven that you don’t need conflict and bitchiness for a women’s panel show to work. You don’t need the <em>The View’s</em> Elizabeth vs Rosie dynamic. &nbsp;<em>The Circle</em> works because the women are authentic, they’re from the same tribe and the focus is on laughter not squabbling. &nbsp;Sure they’re all different with different backgrounds but at the risk of sounding hokey, the focus is on joy. Not controversy. &nbsp;And whoever thought to put Yumi Stynes on morning television deserves a frickin’ TV award. She’s HILARIOUS and totally unpredictable and just a little bit wicked. &nbsp;So I watch Denise and Gorgi and Yumi and Chrissie and I think, “Yeah, I reckon they’d be from my tribe” – because they’re inclusive and funny and not afraid to be themselves. That’s why I like the show. That’s why it works. &nbsp;Here’s hoping I don’t completely screw up on Tuesday. xxx</p>

            <p>I know its been a while since I blogged. But I have an excuse (stop rolling your eyes). I moved house. I moved house with a rambunctious dog and a mischievous toddler and a husband who was about to start night-shift. &nbsp;I hate moving house even though I should be good at it by now. With Brad’s job we’ve moved about four times in the last five years. Anyway … excuses excuses excuses.</p> 
            <p>So in the time since my last post, FIND YOUR TRIBE (and 9 other things I wish I’d known in high school) has hit the shops. We had a fabulous launch last week involving two of my tribe: radio host Robin Bailey (97.3FM host and one of the first females whose name led a breakfast radio team) and Frances Whiting (columnist, surfer, bad guitar player, all-round-great-girl). I’ve also been doing a bit of media. Lots of radio interviews. &nbsp;Filmed a fantastic, hilarious story with Sofie Formica from the Great South East last week (air date to be confirmed). I’m doing some newspaper stuff (stay tuned) and I’ll be doing some book store appearances. I’ll post those dates when I get hold of ’em.</p> 
            <p>Most of all I’ve received a wonderful response to Find Your Tribe – which means more to me than anything else. Lots of reader emails which I love to get even if it takes me a while to reply.</p> 
            <p>Phone is ringing. Ava is crying. Better go. Will post more appearance info when it comes to hand.</p>

            <p>It’s been a disturbing month. Every time I turn around there’s yet another horror story. Bullying that results in a school stabbing.&nbsp; A young girl abducted from her bed and murdered by a family friend. The dangers of on-line paedophiles. And then those ongoing reports on teen binge drinking, body image issues, obesity and promiscuity in kids as young as twelve.</p> 
            <p>I used to think that high school today was no harder than when I was at school. I don’t think that anymore. I think our teenagers are struggling as much as their parents to navigate their way through.</p> 
            <p>Over the past three years I’ve received dozens of emails from teenage girls. Many just write to say hello. But others email asking for advice.&nbsp; Meg* wrote about the panic attacks she’d started to suffer before going into exams. Brigid* would pen me hilarious letters during her stay in a health clinic as she dealt with an eating disorder. Shelly* wrote to tell me about the girls in her year 8 class who had started sending naked images of themselves to boys.</p> 
            <p>It was International Women’s Day on Monday. In the past I’ve written columns full of lessons I want our young women to know for the future. But today I’m going to share with you what I think they need to know NOW to survive those joyful but sometimes brutal high school years.</p> 
            <p>In a nutshell, you need to find your tribe.&nbsp; In my opinion, the major factor that determines the quality of your high school experience is who you choose to hang around.&nbsp; Your friends.&nbsp; Forget about the cool group. You need to find your tribe. Your tribe are those people who get you. They get your sense of humour, have similar values and interests to you and are genuine friends who care about you and want what’s best for you. Sounds obvious but you need to avoid those so-called friends who slag you off the moment your back is turned, who routinely belittle you or pressure you to do stuff or be someone you’re not.&nbsp; If you find your tribe – even if it’s just one true friend – you have an instant support system at school and you’ll cope much better with whatever high school throws your way.</p> 
            <p>My new book <em>Find Your Tribe (and 9 other things I wish I’d known in high school)</em> lists my other nine tips for enjoying your teenage years. They include the importance of bouncing back from disappointment, understanding that not even Miranda Kerr always looks like Miranda Kerr, learning to trust your gut instinct (even when that bad vibe is from a family friend), the value in giving back, the truth that success in life has little to do with your OP score, the risks associated with binge drinking and navigating first love (including the dangers of online romances).</p> 
            <p>But the biggest lesson is choosing the right friends to hang around. Find your tribe at school and you’re off to a good start.</p>

            <p>Australian Bookseller and Publisher have reviewed <em>Find Your Tribe (and 9 other things I wish I’d known in high school)</em> and awarded it 4.5 stars out of 5. Yippee! &nbsp;Here’s the review …</p> 
            <p><strong>Find Your Tribe (And Nine Other Things I Wish I’d Known in High School) (Rebecca Sparrow,&nbsp;UQP, $14.95 pb, ISBN 9780702237720, March) </strong></p> 
            <p>“Rebecca Sparrow would’ve been good to know in high&nbsp;school. Find Your Tribe is an important and upliftingbook that will entertain even the most sceptical&nbsp;teen. Sparrow demonstrates her eloquent style and&nbsp;talent for simple, clear prose to impart to her readers&nbsp;the truth––and the humour––about years seven to&nbsp;12 in a book they will actually enjoy. Her advice is&nbsp;so smart and universal that I found myself taking&nbsp;notes to apply to my own life. Educators, parents&nbsp;and counsellors alike will immediately identify the&nbsp;value of not only Sparrow’s advice, but the accessible&nbsp;manner in which it is presented. Pull-quotes and dot-point summaries make Find Your Tribe the perfect&nbsp;book for low attention chapter-skimmers. The advice&nbsp;is aimed mainly at girls; the prose is targeted toward a&nbsp;younger audience but is direct, and not patronising.&nbsp;Sparrow’s The Girl Most Likely dealt with similar&nbsp;issues as Tribe and has not only been successful in&nbsp;print, but will shortly be adapted into a movie. Find&nbsp;Your Tribe is the accessible nonfiction equivalent&nbsp;and should be considered by anyone working&nbsp;with teenagers.”</p> 
            <p>Rebecca Butterworth (née Whitehead) is a&nbsp;bookseller and writer and lives in Melbourne</p>
