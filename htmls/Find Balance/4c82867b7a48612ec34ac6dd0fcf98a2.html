        <p>Balance is something we must exercise so that we don’t lean towards too much of one thing and sacrifice our efforts in another; finding your balance in life is pivotal to your wellbeing and productivity.</p> 
        <p>I want you to achieve that. I’m not a zen master or have all the right answers, but I have a firm belief that exercising mindful methods and ways of thinking will help you exercise balance .</p> 
        <p>Let’s jump right in — 100 different ways to find balance and happiness in your life. I hope that many of these work out for you. This is a very long list and post (3500+ words), so please take it slowly, bookmark it, come back to it, and do the best you can to find something that inspires you,&nbsp;<strong>and take action</strong>.<span id="more-225"></span></p> 
        <ol> 
         <li>What do you tend to do too much of that is overwhelming? Do less. What could you focus on that needs more tending? Do that.</li> 
         <li>Walk with a friend and have a conversation. Steve Jobs loved doing this with his teammates.</li> 
         <li>Clarity is found through actions, not worrying. Worry less, and start doing something. Anything.</li> 
         <li>Don’t rush in getting things done — nothing good ever came from this practice.</li> 
         <li>Be mindful when making your decisions. Consider both your emotions and the facts.</li> 
         <li>Meditate everyday. Start small, 10-15 minutes a day of sitting still and deep breathing.</li> 
         <li>Take a power nap.</li> 
         <li>There is a time and place for everything. Maybe the gym isn’t the right time for you in the mornings? Maybe going at night is better? Maybe waking up early, like 5 a.m.? Experiment with different times of the day and see what fits you best.</li> 
         <li>Clean your work space, car, and room.</li> 
         <li>Listen to music and only music. Shut the world out and just enjoy your favorite tunes.</li> 
         <li>Exercise daily, even if you’re doing it for 15 minutes. Anyone can afford a 15 minute walk or intense exercise.</li> 
         <li>Read someone’s story of struggle and success. It’s inspiring. The internet is filled with these stories.</li> 
         <li>Talk over your issues with your family or friends. Talking things out alleviates stressful situations.</li> 
         <li>Read books about inspiration and how people have overcome roadblocks. Learn from their mistakes and history. This could be you.</li> 
         <li>If you can avoid it, avoid driving during the hours of heavy traffic — many people easily get road rage.</li> 
         <li>Write down what you want to get done today and do it.<em> No excuses.</em></li> 
         <li>Prioritize your life by writing out your issues, important deadlines or events, and organize it in a way that isn’t overwhelming. Some things can be put off for later, while other tasks may be demanded of you that moment.</li> 
         <li>If you continuously think bad things will happen, guess what?&nbsp;<strong>It will happen</strong>.</li> 
         <li>Write in your journal at the end of the day. What did you get done? What would you have liked to get done? What could you do differently so that you’re more productive? Writing something down is way more effective than trying to remember everything in your head.</li> 
         <li>Focus on your goals. Do you want to become content with life? Do you want to build a thriving business? Find out what it takes to achieve this, and do it.</li> 
         <li>Practice yoga.</li> 
         <li>Try something new and don’t look back. Accept it for what it is.</li> 
         <li>Listen to podcasts on motivation or self-help.</li> 
         <li>Read blogs on&nbsp;<a href="http://zenhabits.net" target="_blank">motivation</a>, productivity, and personal development. If the option is available, connect with the writer. They may be willing to help you out.</li> 
         <li>Ask a friend for advice. If they can’t point you in the right direction, don’t get frustrated — you can’t expect all the right answers to be given to you in one moment. Some people search their whole lives for the right answers but never get to find them.</li> 
         <li>If you need to, take the whole day off. Shut off your phone, computer, social media, and just enjoy your favorite activity.</li> 
         <li>Read many books, magazines, and blog posts on your desired topic. If you want to learn about marketing or business or zen meditation, there are a plethora of ways to find this information on the Web. Most of it is free.</li> 
         <li>Sign up for newsletters to a blog that provides valuable insight on self-improvement or guidance.</li> 
         <li>Burning bridges is not always necessary. If you want to stop being around negative people, and they ask why you haven’t been around, don’t be afraid to tell them. Maybe they will want to change, too. You could work together as a team, which makes the process much easier.</li> 
         <li>Tie up loose ends with your friends or family. Talk it out and say what you truly feel. Don’t be afraid of the truth — if you constantly cover up lies with more lies, you’re going to end up with more lies. Simple as that.</li> 
         <li>What is your attitude like? A friend could easily tell you this. Are you too negative? Too confident? Change your attitude and the results will change as well. Develop a positive and content attitude, and your results will portray the same.</li> 
         <li>Focus on one thing and be great at it. When the time is right, move onto something else.</li> 
         <li>Make decisions based off facts and not emotions.</li> 
         <li>Don’t let anger take over you. Stop for a second, breathe, think, and most likely you’ll realize it wasn’t all that bad.</li> 
         <li>Don’t let stress and anxiety rush you to make choices. Take a step back, look at the big picture, think it over, and decide.</li> 
         <li>Join an online community of like-minded people who share your same issues. There are plenty out there, just find the ones that meets your criteria; you are not the only person going through problems.</li> 
         <li>Learn to appreciate the small things in life: your family, friends, good books, music, healthy foods, the sunrise, the moon, nice weather, entertaining shows, etc.</li> 
         <li>Learn to be alone. Let your thoughts wander; try to focus on the positive in your life and appreciate them.</li> 
         <li>Look around. What do you see? Friends? A home? Food on the table? Be thankful because not many people have what you have. Living in such a fruitful and thriving country like America, and not ever seeing the outside world, sometimes makes us forget how fortunate we really are to live here.</li> 
         <li>Learn to say thank you and I’m sorry. Mean it when you say it, don’t just say it to be able to move on.</li> 
         <li>Create a structured, balanced schedule for your life. Don’t try to pack all your tasks in one day. If you have a vacation in a few weeks, instead of doing everything last minute, take it day by day. If you’re planning for a party, take it day by day.</li> 
         <li>Spread your work out so that the tiny tasks can be accomplished, which add up to the bigger picture.</li> 
         <li>Quit your bad habits for good. If you’re fed up, that’s a good sign — that means you want change.</li> 
         <li>Create something — music, art, writing, poetry, architecture, design.</li> 
         <li>Pray to whomever you believe in; it’s amazing what kind of thoughts come out during prayer.</li> 
         <li>Are you surrounded by negativity all the time? Move away from it. If you’re afraid you’ll offend someone, don’t worry about that. Don’t focus on someone else’s feelings: focus on you getting better. This is your time, your life. If you continue to focus on pleasing others, you will forget about yourself.</li> 
         <li>Read your hero’s bibliography. What did they do in the face of stress and daunting situations? How did they react? What can you learn from them?</li> 
         <li>What can be accomplished now? Do that.</li> 
         <li>Shut off all distractions from time to time. Stop living on social media, stop going on your phone for no reason at all, and stop doing mindless tasks. Calculate all the hours you spent doing nothing and use that time to do something productive, such as reading, your passions and hobbies, resting, cooking, exercising, creating, laughing.</li> 
         <li>I personally disagree with anyone who says to vent on social media. I find that ineffective and weak. It develops bad habits, so every time something bad comes into your life, you turn to social media. This does nothing. Turn to people who matter, people who will care and listen. Don’t Facebook your problems — face them.</li> 
         <li>Learn to live frugally.</li> 
         <li>Don’t focus on materialistic happiness. Sure getting the new iPhone would be great, but there are more than a handful of ways around it. There are different technologies and platforms that do the same tasks.</li> 
         <li>Enjoy the small, comforting activities.</li> 
         <li>If you like setting schedules and making plans, create ones that you will commit to. Breaking plans is like breaking a promise, and we all know how that turns out.</li> 
         <li>Learn to do some research; this may alleviate possible stressful outcomes. A little bit of research can go a long way.</li> 
         <li>Don’t be afraid to ask for help; it will surprise you who steps up to the plate.</li> 
         <li>Use applications or calendars to help you stay on track. Use the tools to facilitate your daily tasks. I use Siri on my iPhone to remind me of webinars, events, and Q&amp;A calls from my favorite websites; I haven’t missed an event yet.</li> 
         <li>Just take a minute, write it down if you need to, and think about what you do throughout the day. Do you see a pattern? Is there something you can do less of and direct it towards something else? These little minutes of meaningless tasks add up to a lot.</li> 
         <li>I’m a huge fan of post-its — writing short, quick notes on them and placing them in locations I always go to or look at. It’s a great reminder, and you can throw it away when it’s complete.</li> 
         <li>Try running or exercising without music. Hear your thoughts. What do you think? What do you feel?</li> 
         <li>What brings you down? Stop doing it. What food makes you sluggish? Stop eating it. Start slow and little by little — this change does not happen overnight. When you take out a negative, fill it in with a positive.</li> 
         <li>Don’t dwell so much on the past, but look towards the future and what it has to offer.</li> 
         <li>Turn every negative outcome into a positive by changing your mindset. What can you learn from this failure? How much better will your next result be? Don’t focus on what you did wrong: focus on how you can become better.</li> 
         <li>“<em>To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.</em>”&nbsp;―&nbsp;Ralph Waldo Emerson. Don’t be afraid to be you.</li> 
         <li>Do you work a job that you hate? Do you feel like you can’t quit? That’s a choice you’re ultimately making for yourself. You have a choice to follow your passions and dreams. Take it a step at a time if you must. Slowly disconnect yourself from that negative lifestyle and start adapting to a new one; you will pick up new habits, think new thoughts, and act as if you are fearless.</li> 
         <li>Learn to be present. Live in this moment, right now. Don’t think about three hours from now — what is the point?</li> 
         <li>If you plan, create small. Big plans lead to big expectations, and big expectations can possibly lead to a big upset.</li> 
         <li>Learn to sacrifice your fun for productive, meaningful work. There has to be an equal balance between fun and work. Some people do both, but there is a balance in between all of it.</li> 
         <li>Life is full of balance — look around you. Too much of anything is not good for you — that’s something we learned ever since we were younger.</li> 
         <li>It’s okay to fail. How would we ever taste succeed if we never had any failures? How could we ever know the difference? Failure is not fatal.</li> 
         <li>People always talk about exercising and the gym, but I also find it important to exercise your mind. You can easily find balance in your life the more you educate yourself about the world around you. Dive into books, get lost, learn now things, and apply it to your life. This act also benefits those around you.</li> 
         <li>Listen to motivational audio tapes. Listen to it as you drive to work or before the gym. Some people like to read, others like to listen.</li> 
         <li>Tell yourself you can do what you wish to achieve. The only thing stopping you is yourself. If you consistently keep telling yourself, “Monday is going to suck,” guess what? Monday is going to suck.</li> 
         <li>Realize that everything takes steps. People don’t wake up and become a superstar at a sport; they train, exercise, watch film, practice, and push themselves to the limit. That results in becoming a champion. Use this approach for all of your challenges. Step at a time. You don’t run first — you learn to crawl, then you walk, then jog, then you run, and finally an all-out sprint.</li> 
         <li>Life has ups and downs. This is something we have to face. There’s always good times and bad times. If you’re in a bad situation, just tell yourself that you will get better, you will be stronger, and in a few months from now you will probably laugh at that situation. It happens all the time to many different kinds of people. It’s like that old saying, whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.</li> 
         <li>Why do people have their phone out when they’re around company? This is an epidemic impulse I’ve been seeing in public and within my own group of friends. Next time, try not to take your phone out, and if you see your friend doing so, try to get them to put it away. Engage in meaningful conversation. Enjoy the time being spent. Why be on Twitter or Facebook? Is something that much more interesting than the person right in front of you? Think about this.</li> 
         <li>When you’re doing work or with a friend, learn to shut off all distractions. You can get to that email later. You can see what someone tweeted later. You can read the news later. Be present and mindful. It’s respectful to your company and develops good habits.</li> 
         <li>Don’t focus so much on time. Sure, deadlines must be met, so you must devise how to use your hours wisely. The hours in your day are not created equally — some hours you’re at your best, and others you may be tired. Don’t aim at finishing a project in one hour when it deserves to be three or four. Maybe that extra time will create a more spectacular product.</li> 
         <li>Learn to take action. Remember when you said you were going to quit smoking? Or clean your whole house? What stopped you from doing it? Self-control? Fear? Time? No, it was you and only you. If you don’t take action now, who do you expect to do it for you? No one will, and that’s the truth. If you want things to happen, you have to make it happen.</li> 
         <li>Control your thoughts and emotions. There are plenty people out there that will irritate you. There will always be bad drivers. There will always be traffic and red lights. Don’t let these meager situations anger you to a point where it ruins your whole day.</li> 
         <li>Stop feeling sorry for yourself. You think you have it bad? You can spend 10 minutes and find 1,000 people who have it worse than you ever did. Pick yourself up, brush off the dirt, and start moving.</li> 
         <li>Do something you haven’t done in a while: biking, hiking, mountain climbing, swimming, running on the beach, running at night, roller skating, snowboarding, listening to a certain kind of music, eating something you haven’t, visiting a place you haven’t been to since childhood, visit your family, going to a concert, etc.</li> 
         <li>Try living life without any goals or plans. Live in the moment.</li> 
         <li>Learn a new craft.</li> 
         <li>Pick up a new hobby.</li> 
         <li>Quit social media for good — or use it sparingly, say, once a day and only for an hour.</li> 
         <li>Try to avoid waking up and checking your emails and social media right away. Do something different. Read the paper. Go for a jog. Cook breakfast.</li> 
         <li>Having reciprocity is noble and well-respected; the process of exchanging things for mutual benefits. Learn to give and help others; it is fruitful to your relationships and growth.</li> 
         <li>Some people work too hard — as weird as it may sound. Some people forgot how to enjoy their time and well-being because they got so caught up in the busy life. Learn to take some time off, even if it’s for an hour or a day. Your mind and body needs rest, too. You will function and produce much better if you’re well-rested.</li> 
         <li>Hate driving? Find a viable bus route. Car pool. If you can, bike to your destination.</li> 
         <li>Attend motivational seminars. Many community college and universities around my area have speakers come in; most of the time, you don’t have to be a student to join. Sometimes it’s a small fee, most of the time it’s free. Check around your area and see if this is available.</li> 
         <li>I’m not saying that you will find balance and happiness by going back to school, but if you go for the right reasons, yes you will. You will network with like-minded students, there will be opportunities to intern or join clubs, you will put yourself in a position where you have to educate yourself, and doing so may create a new life for you.</li> 
         <li>Stop comparing yourself to others.</li> 
         <li>Don’t count other people’s money or success.</li> 
         <li>Stop trying to control everything at once — especially if you’re trying to control with force and anger.</li> 
         <li>Learn to let things go. It’s easier said than done, but once you initiate and practice — even if you fail often — you will develop the habit, and will soon be able to let go of past differences and negative outcomes.</li> 
         <li><strong>Don’t feed the trolls</strong>&nbsp;(let me explain). Often, we come across people who say negative things and expect you to respond. I call this feeding the troll, and it’s something we must not do. Simply ignore the person, laugh, and move on. The more you feed them, the more crap they’re going to send at you. No one wins, and you stoop down to their level.</li> 
         <li>Stop letting mass media drive you to believing that your life is supposed to be lived a certain way. You write the book. You are original. There is no one else like you, so why be something you’re not? This is hard to do, but once you achieve this, you begin to see your true potential.</li> 
         <li>Surround yourself with good company, positive friends, and people who are like you. If you consistently hang out with negative people who dwell on the past and cannot live up to their expectations, you will end up doing the same; they will drag you down and it’ll be hard to pick yourself up.</li> 
         <li>Last but not least, learn to get out of your comfort zone. Experiment and try new things. Test yourself and see what you’re really made of. Face your fears and you will come out stronger than yesterday. I know you can do it, because I did, and the person behind me did it, and the person next to you has probably done it, too.</li> 
        </ol> 
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this, I hope this has instilled some valuable insight and methods to begin improving your life and finding balance.</p> 
        <p>I will end it with a childhood quote, something to bring us back:</p> 
        <p style="text-align: center;">“<em>You’ll get mixed up, of course, as you already know. You’ll get mixed up with many strange birds as you go. So be sure when you step. Step with care and great tact and remember that Life’s a Great Balancing Act. Just never forget to be dexterous and deft. And never mix up your right foot with your left.</em>”&nbsp;―&nbsp;Dr. Seuss</p> 
        <p>Please share this post with someone who you think needs a little bit of balance and happiness in their life — I’m sure we all can think of someone.</p>
