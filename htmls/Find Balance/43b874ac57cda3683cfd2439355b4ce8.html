tml-version=\"2\" --><p>“Work-life balance.” What used to be heralded as the promised land now is looking more like modern woman's special kind of hell. With&nbsp;startling headlines like “<a href=\"http://time.com/money/3920572/work-life-balance/\">Is Work-Life Balance Even Possible?<\/a><em>” <\/em>and \"<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/03/06/work-life-integration/\">Work-Life Balance is Dead<\/a>\"<em>&nbsp;<\/em>featured in major media outlets the past couple years, the debate is ongoing. The core of the argument is this: to be productive and happy, do we need a better on-off switch to divide the personal vs. professional parts of our lives, or do we simply need to better integrate them?<\/p><p>I spoke with Kendra Davies, Professional Certified Coach and speaker and owner of <a href=\"http://stellarlifecoaching.com/\">Stellar Life Coaching<\/a>, who spent over a decade in corporate H.R. She shares her thoughts on evolving work-life balance, and how we can equip ourselves if we're struggling to find balance.<\/p><h2>How has work-life balance changed over the past decade?<\/h2><p><strong>Davies:<\/strong>&nbsp;Work-life balance has changed&nbsp;as a response to technology. Our society as a whole has created a ‘busy = productive’ culture, and nurtured a <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/08/introverts-quiet-extroverts-fomo-confidence\">FOMO (fear of missing out) mentality<\/a>. This change has shifted our perspective away from wellbeing and onto scarcity and insecurity.<\/p><h2>So balance is more necessary than ever. What about those who don't&nbsp;draw a hard line between work and life?<\/h2><p><strong>Davies:<\/strong>&nbsp;Work is not life. Work is simply the energy, time, and effort we choose to put into a job. The common denominator between work and life is the person/employee. The average American will spend some 91,000+ hours working; that is just Monday-Friday 9-5 from ages 18-65. As we know, many of us are clocking way more hours than that.<\/p><p>When we factor in email, phone calls, texts, overtime, weekend work etc., the only thing we will do more of is sleep—that is, if we are not too stressed about our work. The necessity of work-life balance is to remind us that the lives we lead (i.e., our relationships, personal feelings, and self-care outside of the office) deserve as much energy effort and time (as much as we can) as work.<\/p><h2>What are some signs that you’re doing “work-life” balance wrong?<\/h2><p><strong>Davies:<\/strong>&nbsp;If you...<\/p><ul><li>Respond to emails late at night.<\/li><li>Find that you cannot be fully present with your family or friends because you are distracted by the what-ifs or deadlines for a project<\/li><li>Use your work phone as a personal phone.<\/li><li>Keep your work phone by your bed.<\/li><li>Have not set a cut-off time to checking work emails on all devices.<\/li><li>Have missed multiple events in a quarter or a year, for people whom you care deeply for, because of work.<\/li><li>Are consistently sleeping less than 6-8 hours because you can’t stop thinking about work.<\/li><li>Have had a lot of work successes/achievements, but you lost friends, gained weight, started smoking again, are taking a new medication, or&nbsp;have been criticized by people who love you for not being around.<\/li><\/ul><h2>What are some practical tips to gain more sanity in this balance?<\/h2><ol><li>Albert Einstein said, “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.” So do something different. Set boundaries and time restrictions on your&nbsp;devices.<\/li><li><a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/05/morning-bedtime-routines-successful-people-productivity\">Buy a relic of the early-'90s called an alarm clock<\/a>, and don’t keep your phone (personal or work) next to your bed.<\/li><li>Develop self-care rituals. Some common self-care choices among my clients are: <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/01/affordable-free-workout-videos-gym-get-fit-at-home-pilates-kickboxing\">Youtube Yoga in your living room<\/a> for 15 minutes or less, guided meditations for 5 minutes at lunch or before bed, writing <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/11/mental-health-benefits-gratitude-positive-thinking-thanksgiving\">thank you notes<\/a> to the people who contribute value to your life every week, physical activities or other hobbies like salsa dancing or joining a bowling league, volunteer regularly for a charity.<\/li><li>Trying<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/12/simple-natural-ways-to-sleep-better-without-taking-medicine\"> everything you can<\/a> until you find something that works to get you to sleep 6-8 hours a night. Your body requires sleep to heal, to process, to rest, and to help you function another day. Lack of sleep can contribute to all of the same physical ailments as stress. Blood pressure, heart health, kidney functioning, weight gain, fatigue and even depression.<\/li><li>Write down your personal mission.<\/li><\/ol><h2>How can having a personal mission create better work-life balance?<\/h2><p><strong>Davies:<\/strong>&nbsp;Here is the deal–I have an awesome first-time executive as a client. She wants to be like Olivia Pope (from the popular TV Show <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/12/scandal-winter-finale-planned-parenthood-defunded\">Scandal<\/a>), and she wants her team to feel like Ms. Pope’s gladiators. She wrote a mission to communicate her vision. That vision includes&nbsp;flourishing personal lives, compassionate support for each other, and goal-smashing work ethic. Do not take work at face value. Decide what “work” is to you, and have a clear vision of the life you want to live outside of the office. Live and work to meet that goal for yourself.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Equipped with these tips, think about your own work-life balance. There's no one-size-fits-all equation. Balance, in such simple terms, may be unrealistic, but each and every one of us can work to achieve a routine that allows us to flourish both professionally and personally.<\/p><p><em>Photo

             <p>“Work-life balance.” What used to be heralded as the promised land now is looking more like modern woman's special kind of hell. With&nbsp;startling headlines like “<a href="http://time.com/money/3920572/work-life-balance/">Is Work-Life Balance Even Possible?</a><em>” </em>and "<a href="http://fortune.com/2015/03/06/work-life-integration/">Work-Life Balance is Dead</a>"<em>&nbsp;</em>featured in major media outlets the past couple years, the debate is ongoing. The core of the argument is this: to be productive and happy, do we need a better on-off switch to divide the personal vs. professional parts of our lives, or do we simply need to better integrate them?</p>

             <p>I spoke with Kendra Davies, Professional Certified Coach and speaker and owner of <a href="http://stellarlifecoaching.com/">Stellar Life Coaching</a>, who spent over a decade in corporate H.R. She shares her thoughts on evolving work-life balance, and how we can equip ourselves if we're struggling to find balance.</p>
             <h2>How has work-life balance changed over the past decade?</h2>
             <p><strong>Davies:</strong>&nbsp;Work-life balance has changed&nbsp;as a response to technology. Our society as a whole has created a ‘busy = productive’ culture, and nurtured a <a href="http://verilymag.com/2016/08/introverts-quiet-extroverts-fomo-confidence">FOMO (fear of missing out) mentality</a>. This change has shifted our perspective away from wellbeing and onto scarcity and insecurity.</p>
             <h2>So balance is more necessary than ever. What about those who don't&nbsp;draw a hard line between work and life?</h2>
             <p><strong>Davies:</strong>&nbsp;Work is not life. Work is simply the energy, time, and effort we choose to put into a job. The common denominator between work and life is the person/employee. The average American will spend some 91,000+ hours working; that is just Monday-Friday 9-5 from ages 18-65. As we know, many of us are clocking way more hours than that.</p>
             <p>When we factor in email, phone calls, texts, overtime, weekend work etc., the only thing we will do more of is sleep—that is, if we are not too stressed about our work. The necessity of work-life balance is to remind us that the lives we lead (i.e., our relationships, personal feelings, and self-care outside of the office) deserve as much energy effort and time (as much as we can) as work.</p>

             <ul>
              <li>Respond to emails late at night.</li>
              <li>Find that you cannot be fully present with your family or friends because you are distracted by the what-ifs or deadlines for a project</li>
              <li>Use your work phone as a personal phone.</li>
              <li>Keep your work phone by your bed.</li>
              <li>Have not set a cut-off time to checking work emails on all devices.</li>
              <li>Have missed multiple events in a quarter or a year, for people whom you care deeply for, because of work.</li>
              <li>Are consistently sleeping less than 6-8 hours because you can’t stop thinking about work.</li>
              <li>Have had a lot of work successes/achievements, but you lost friends, gained weight, started smoking again, are taking a new medication, or&nbsp;have been criticized by people who love you for not being around.</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>What are some practical tips to gain more sanity in this balance?</h2>
             <ol>
              <li>Albert Einstein said, “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.” So do something different. Set boundaries and time restrictions on your&nbsp;devices.</li>
              <li><a href="http://verilymag.com/2016/05/morning-bedtime-routines-successful-people-productivity">Buy a relic of the early-'90s called an alarm clock</a>, and don’t keep your phone (personal or work) next to your bed.</li>
              <li>Develop self-care rituals. Some common self-care choices among my clients are: <a href="http://verilymag.com/2016/01/affordable-free-workout-videos-gym-get-fit-at-home-pilates-kickboxing">Youtube Yoga in your living room</a> for 15 minutes or less, guided meditations for 5 minutes at lunch or before bed, writing <a href="http://verilymag.com/2015/11/mental-health-benefits-gratitude-positive-thinking-thanksgiving">thank you notes</a> to the people who contribute value to your life every week, physical activities or other hobbies like salsa dancing or joining a bowling league, volunteer regularly for a charity.</li>
              <li>Trying<a href="http://verilymag.com/2016/12/simple-natural-ways-to-sleep-better-without-taking-medicine"> everything you can</a> until you find something that works to get you to sleep 6-8 hours a night. Your body requires sleep to heal, to process, to rest, and to help you function another day. Lack of sleep can contribute to all of the same physical ailments as stress. Blood pressure, heart health, kidney functioning, weight gain, fatigue and even depression.</li>
              <li>Write down your personal mission.</li>
             </ol>
             <h2>How can having a personal mission create better work-life balance?</h2>
             <p><strong>Davies:</strong>&nbsp;Here is the deal–I have an awesome first-time executive as a client. She wants to be like Olivia Pope (from the popular TV Show <a href="http://verilymag.com/2015/12/scandal-winter-finale-planned-parenthood-defunded">Scandal</a>), and she wants her team to feel like Ms. Pope’s gladiators. She wrote a mission to communicate her vision. That vision includes&nbsp;flourishing personal lives, compassionate support for each other, and goal-smashing work ethic. Do not take work at face value. Decide what “work” is to you, and have a clear vision of the life you want to live outside of the office. Live and work to meet that goal for yourself.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Equipped with these tips, think about your own work-life balance. There's no one-size-fits-all equation. Balance, in such simple terms, may be unrealistic, but each and every one of us can work to achieve a routine that allows us to flourish both professionally and personally.</p>

If you’re like many young professionals today, it can seem like there's always a way to be more productive, answer that email just a hair faster, be just that much shinier to snag the promotion. The issue with this mentality is that&nbsp;work then&nbsp;threatens to take over your life.<\/p><p>Do you feel like you spend all your time either at work or at home stressing about work? Does spending quality time with friends take the back seat on your schedule? Have you decided not to work out because you “just don’t have the time”? Then&nbsp;it’s time to reclaim your free time and establish some work/life balance with these 10&nbsp;easy tips.<\/p><p><strong>01. Develop a Morning Routine<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n If&nbsp;your morning routine begins with hitting the snooze button and ends with rushing out the door, granola bar in hand, you're missing out on what could be your favorite part of the day. Laura Vanderkam, author of <em><a href=\"http://lauravanderkam.com/books/successful-people-do/\">What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast<\/a>,<\/em> looked at the habits of highly successful executives. She found that the majority had a productive morning routine. It included some form of self-care (exercising, journaling, working on a side project, etc.). Map out what your ideal morning looks like. Does it include 30 minutes of exercise? How about a leisurely breakfast while reading a new book? Set goals for making your morning routine a success—and something to look forward to each day. Pack your work bag and lunch the night before. Set your alarm an hour early. And be sure to get enough sleep!<\/p><p><strong>02. Set Work Boundaries and Stick to Them<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n Always being “on call” is a big contributor to work-related stress because you never truly stop working. Decide how and when you will be reachable after office hours. Will you check your email three times a night, not at all, or somewhere between? Schedule specific time slots during work hours to check email throughout the day. It keeps you focused on the task at hand and not distracted by the latest email in your inbox. There’s no right answer, but discussing this with your boss will help you establish a workable solution. Remember, being available at all hours sends the message that you never stop working. And always being on call can lead to burnout.<\/p><p><strong>03. Take Your Paid&nbsp;Time Off<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n Seventy-five percent&nbsp;of American workers don’t use all their paid vacation days, according to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2014/04/04/only-25-of-americans-take-their-paid-vacation/\">a Glassdoor survey<\/a>. In some workplaces,&nbsp;the underlying assumption is&nbsp;that taking a vacation means you are replaceable. So instead of taking the time to invest in your well-being, you feel expected to work long hours and eschew vacation days. But t<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB104871054094715300\">he benefit of vacation days is well-documented<\/a> and is a great way to reduce stress. Entrepreneur <a href=\"http://sethbannon.com/\">Seth Bannon<\/a> explains the problem with not taking those hard-earned vacation days:<\/p><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p>“Professional runners take long breaks between marathons. They make no excuses for this, and no one judges them for it, because everyone knows that rest and recuperation is an essential part of being a pro athlete. The same is true for entrepreneurs (and everyone, really)...It’s time we stopped making excuses for rest and relaxation.”<\/p><\/blockquote><p><strong>04. Take Up a Hobby<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n Life isn’t all about work. Consider taking up a hobby, whether that's a sport or something creative like photography. Sign up for classes, join a club, or partner with a friend for the goal of learning&nbsp;something new. One of the best ways to prevent burnout and keep stress at bay is to have a rewarding personal life. Hobbies are an essential ingredient.<\/p><p><strong>05. Add Some Exercise to Your Day<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n Fitting exercise into your day can be a challenge, but you can start out slowly and increase the amount you exercise over time. Taking group classes, joining a running or biking club, enlisting the help of a workout buddy, or using commitment apps like <a href=\"http://www.gym-pact.com/\">Gym-Pact<\/a>&nbsp;will help keep you motivated. <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/stress-management/in-depth/exercise-and-stress/art-20044469\">Adding exercise to your day will reduce stres<\/a>s and provide&nbsp;countless other health benefits.<\/p><p><strong>06. Eat Right<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n Skipping breakfast, snacking on a bag of chips for lunch, and nibbling on cupcakes from the break room is not a recipe for success. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/03/study-eat-protein-in-the-morning/274417/\">Studies have shown the importance of eating a protein-rich breakfast<\/a>. Start off your morning with protein-rich foods like eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, peanut butter, and whole grains. You’ll stay full longer and be more likely to make healthy choices throughout the day. There are lots of <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/recipe-easy-breakfast-for-two/\">great<\/a><a href=\"http://verilymag.com/granola-recipe-healthy-eating/\">recipes<\/a> out there but try these <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/4-swaps-to-a-healthier-breakfast/\">4 easy swaps to a healthier breakfast<\/a> for starters.<\/p><p><strong>07. Connect With Friends<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n This sounds obvious, but how many times do we go two or three weeks without seeing our favorite people? <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/friendship-newly-discovered-stress-reliever-in-rare-supply/\">Quality time with friends reduces stress<\/a>. But too often it falls by the wayside when life gets busy. Schedule time to meet with friends monthly. Develop a ritual, get pedis, meet for drinks, or go on a long walk and explore your neighborhood.<\/p><p><strong>08. Communicate With Your Boss and Coworkers<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n Feeling overwhelmed at work can be a significant contributor to stress. It’s important to talk&nbsp;to your boss when you're exhausted so that you can work toward a solution together. Check out these<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/how-to-say-no-to-your-boss/\">&nbsp;helpful tips for when you need to tell your boss you’re overloaded<\/a>.<\/p><p><strong>09. Sleep Right<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n We all know lack of sleep throws off work/life balance. <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/sleep-experts-close-in-on-the-optimal-nights-sleep-1405984970\">New studies suggest that seven hours is the ideal amount&nbsp;of sleep per night<\/a>. A nighttime routine can ensure you get the amount of sleep you need to feel energized and refreshed for the next day. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/17/better-sleep-tips-best_n_4958036.html\">Experts suggest<\/a> going to bed at the same time every night and keeping your room in total darkness. Avoid screen time—that means no scrolling through Pinterest right before you close your eyes! Set your phone to “Do Not Disturb” or leave it in another room and use an old-fashioned alarm clock to wake you up. A lavender-scented candle and reading before bed are relaxing additions to winding down for the night.<\/p><p><strong>10. Stop Burnout Before It Happens<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">\n Burnout builds over time.

It was tough on both my bank account and my calendar. Convenient restaurant dinners became home-cooked meals. I was no longer simply doing the work; I was building and managing a business as well. Now, I’m busier than ever while earning far less. But, finally, I feel relaxed and happy.<\/p><p>Being busy gets a bad rap these days. It all started four years ago with <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/\">The ‘Busy’ Trap<\/a>, the 2012 <em>New York Times<\/em> opinion piece that thrust the war on busyness into mainstream conversation. Since then, busy people have been painted time and again as <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/06/why-we-humblebrag-about-being-busy/\">frenetic show-offs<\/a>, staving off the existential crisis awaiting them on the day they decide to take a break.<\/p><p>If this experience has taught me anything, it’s that there’s more to ‘being busy’ than having a packed schedule. What’s more, setting goals to ‘be less busy’ potentially cuts us off from leading meaningful and satisfying lives.<\/p><h2>What happens to a busybody?<\/h2><p>There’s no sugar-coating it—the stress of being busy <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/02/04/busy-hurry-work-stress/\">can make you sick<\/a>. Prolonged stress has been linked to depression, fatigue, insomnia, peptic ulcers, skin rashes, and illness. Longer term, stress may place us at risk of developing heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and osteoporosis. Ouch.<\/p><p>Most of us learn the hard way how stress-related disorders can sneak up on us—usually, when we’re too busy to notice. After a while, we get used to the discomforts amidst our day-to-day routines. We consider them normal. I've held down stressful, busy jobs, striving to accomplish too much in too short a time, with too few resources—a story many share. For years, I gritted my teeth through depression and anxiety, irritability and arguments, and spent my hard-earned dollars on doctors, physiotherapists, and counselors.<\/p><p>But as I dove into my new career as a writer, suddenly juggling a to-do list bigger than ever, I noticed many of my ‘normal’ physical and psychological discomforts begin to disappear. My persistent neck and shoulder pain subsided. I fell sick less often and experienced fewer bouts of breathlessness (<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/09/dealing-with-an-anxiety-disorder-mental-health-panic-attacks-stress-heart-palpitations\">a symptom of anxiety<\/a>). I stopped clenching my jaw and grinding my teeth at night (<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/12/stress-teeth-grinding-remedies-dental-health-temporomandibular-joint-disorder\">anxiety is thought to contribute to TMJ disorder<\/a>). I slept better and woke up refreshed, despite the onslaught of new deadlines and pressures.<\/p><p>I began to suspect my busy-ness wasn’t the reason I’d been so stressed out and unwell.<\/p><h2>There’s science to suggest that being busy isn’t so bad after all.<\/h2><p>In 2015, research by the Swiss National Science Foundation found that gainfully employed adults who <em>also<\/em> engaged in volunteer work reported <a href=\"http://www.snf.ch/en/researchinFocus/newsroom/Pages/news-150210-press-release-the-benefits-of-voluntary-work-for-the-working-population.aspx\">greater feelings of satisfaction and work-life balance<\/a>, despite being busier with both a day and a side job. This aligns with the results of another study, which showed keeping busy with good deeds can help <a href=\"http://www.springer.com/gp/about-springer/media/springer-select/doing-good-deeds-helps-socially-anxious-people-relax/679444\">reduce the effects of social anxiety<\/a>. Additionally, research into the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24202238\">physiological effects of boredom<\/a> have found that being idle and under-challenged can be just as stressful as being overworked.<\/p><p>Over the years, I had experimented with ‘being less busy,’ imposing bans on going out or picking up new projects, even if I was excited about them. The break was nice at first, but I always ended up fidgety, only to get busy again by choice.<\/p><p>Though there had been times I burnt myself out on doing too much, doing <em>less<\/em>, as a blanket rule, simply wasn’t fun or fulfilling.<\/p><h2>Be busy with purpose.<\/h2><p>In 2010, a study published in the <em>Psychological Science<\/em> journal concluded that <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-07/afps-tmo072910.php\">keeping a person busy keeps them happy<\/a>. This plays on the idea that we experience a dual desire for busyness <em>and<\/em> purpose. In the early years of human evolution, conserving energy was vital to our survival; expending it for no good reason could lead to our demise.<\/p><p>“With modern means of production, however,” note the researchers, “most people today no longer expend much energy on basic survival needs, so they have excessive energy, which they like to release through action. Yet the long-formed tendency to conserve energy lingers, making people wary of expending effort without purpose.”<\/p><p>In short, we like to keep busy with things that matter. So the real question isn’t whether being busy is bad for us. It's whether it would be so terrible if every item on our to-do list was meaningful.<\/p><p>My decision to switch careers forced me to look at what I really wanted, and what I was willing to sacrifice for it. I realized my new profession would dominate my hours. I’d be busy in a whole new way.<\/p><p>But I finally knew what I wanted and, armed with this fresh sense of purpose, I felt unfazed by the prospect of a full schedule. It wasn’t long before I figured out which activities would lead to the most important outcomes. <a href=\"http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.14.0130\">My goals no longer conflicted with each other<\/a>; everything I did served a common purpose. I lost that once-familiar sense of being frazzled and rushed.<\/p><h2>How to stress less when you’re busier than ever<\/h2><p>For me, finding satisfaction came from looking at tasks taking up space in my life and asking what each of it meant to me. Elements of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lawtonursrey/2014/04/17/the-art-of-essentialism/#27a4465e1830\">Essentialism<\/a> and <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/09/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-decluttering-your-home-peace-spark-of-joy\">KonMari<\/a> came into play, as I asked myself whether an activity was meaningful and whether the result brought me joy.<\/p><p>This simple hack to my perspective didn’t take much effort, but required practice before it came naturally. And it didn’t work overnight. I started asking myself these questions long before deciding to change careers, and my plans looked very different then.<\/p><p>Contrary to how you feel when you know something in your life needs to change, you don’t always need to know where you'll end up before you begin the process of figuring out what to do. <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/10/the-perfect-job-career-plan\">It may not be wise to quit your job<\/a>, but you can start taking stock of what motivates you <em>at any time. <\/em>Give yourself the space you need to discover and prepare for what the answer might be.<\/p><h2>There is no quick fix for an unhappily busy life.<\/h2><p>We find our way into this situation gradually through habit, so it’s not unreasonable to expect that’s how we’ll find our way out. When busyness takes hold, the philosophical search for meaning may seem like a useless distraction, counter-productive to getting things done.<\/p><p>But it was only by giving myself the opportunity to think about it—even if just for five minutes each day—that I stumbled upon the small tweaks in my routine and behavior that gradually got me to a better place.<\/p><p>By weighing up each task against your unique sense of purpose and passion, you dip beneath the surface of your frantic schedule and understand your reasons for staying so busy. Sometimes you’ll find portions of your life you can simply let go of. Sometimes, you’ll find responsibilities and obligations that only need to be adjusted, along with satisfying life choices you just forgot you made.<\/p><p>Tim Kreider, author of that <em>New York Times <\/em>piece, concludes by saying, “Life’s too short to be busy.” I disagree. Filling your days with activities that bring joy to you and others actually sounds pretty good.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/reginaleah/\">Regina Leah Photography<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202500025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202500025ce","primaryImageId":"ci01e7edacb00124a8","path":"/2016/03/marie-kondo-burnout-stress-happiness-busy-schedule","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01e1f418700099de"},{"$ref":"ci01e046c950002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01df8871900099de"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202500025ce"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01e08c9580002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01d0dfe6c0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0a9f0019512"},{"$ref":"ci01cfa20eb0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0c1d0022a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0019512"},{"$ref":"ci01d0dfc9700099de"}],"socialPopularity":235,"featuredMediaId":"ci01e7edacb00124a8","slug":"marie-kondo-burnout-stress-happiness-busy-schedule","contentNodeId":"cn01e79faa70002705","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2016-01-21T17:40:15Z","publicationTimestamp":"2016-01-21T17:40:16Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01e33d3fe0009512","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","isNoindex":false,"title":"Sandy Lim","slug":"sandy-lim","disqusId":"bb06cbc4-c065-11e5-9ce0-002219604568","twitterUsername":"sandysandy","website":"http://sandylim.me","bio":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Sandy Lim is a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sandylim.me/\">writer<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sandylovesyou.com/\">maker<\/a>&nbsp;from Perth, Australia.

So when Katie Biber—a political operative who worked as an election lawyer and then as general counsel for Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign—left Washington for the West Coast chill of Silicon Valley, there was, needless to say, a bit of an adjustment period. <br tml-linebreak=\"true\"><\/p><p>But Biber, a Harvard Law graduate who last year was named one of <em><a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g3230/the-new-guard-influential-women/\">Marie Claire<\/a><\/em><a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g3230/the-new-guard-influential-women/\">’s 50 most influential women<\/a> in America, wasn’t deterred. In 2013, she landed a job as senior counsel at a little-known startup called Airbnb. In the two years she spent there, she watched the company grow into a place where she says her East Coast friends “would kill to work.” Last year, she made the jump to another booming company, Thumbtack, which helps connect small business owners, such as landscapers or piano teachers, to people who need their services. <\/p><p>And this is just Biber’s day job. Biber and her husband are also raising their two boys (ages five and seven) to be “full-fledged individuals with opinions and thoughts and concerns about the world.”<\/p><p>Biber spoke with us about her mid-career transition, being 50/50 partners in marriage,  and her plan to strand her kids in San Francisco (don’t be alarmed—it makes way more sense than you’d think).<\/p><p><strong>Rebecca Nelson: You had been in politics for 15 years before getting into tech. What spurred you to make the switch?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Katie Biber: <\/strong>After the 2012 campaign was over, for the first time in my life I felt like I was done working in politics, at least as a full-time vocation. I hadn’t felt that way after any other cycle, so it was a pretty profound realization to know that I would be okay with not spending the next two years preparing for the 2014 election, and then positioning myself to participate in 2016. My husband and I ended up moving to San Francisco because he had a job out here. I pretty quickly decided that I really wanted to work for Airbnb, which my husband and I had been using since the early days, back when it was couch surfing and not a household name by any stretch. So I reached out to the newly-hired general counsel there and kind of stalked and bothered her on LinkedIn until she agreed to talk to me.<\/p><p><strong>RN: Tell me about the decision to move from the East Coast to the Bay Area. What was that like for your family?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB: <\/strong>It was a difficult one. I had spent my entire career working on the East Coast, working in politics, working primarily in D.C., and I felt comfortable. I had friends. I had a political and career network. I had all of the trappings of comfort and knew that I could find my next job in Washington in politics or at a law firm fairly easily. At the same time, my husband had spent virtually the last ten years being supportive of my career. He could have come out to San Francisco following graduation from business school, or graduation from college, and worked in tech way back when. It seemed like it was the right time for him.<\/p><p>All things being equal, D.C. is a great place for me to work. But surprisingly, San Francisco&nbsp;is an even more fulfilling and interesting place to be. So I’m glad that I took the chance and wasn’t so single-mindedly focused on staying in Washington after 2012.<\/p><p><strong>RN: How is it more interesting and fulfilling?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>After a while working in politics and working in government, you begin to feel like you’re fighting over the pieces of a pie that somebody else has created. I wanted to get into the private sector and actually take part in baking the pie. It’s a very fulfilling thing to help grow something from nothing and watch people use the thing you created to help make ends meet, and to empower themselves to build their own small businesses.<\/p><p><strong>RN: Your job kept your family on the East Coast for years, and your husband’s brought you to the West Coast. How do you balance two ambitious people<\/strong><strong>’<\/strong><strong>s careers in a marriage?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB: <\/strong>We truly have a 50/50 partnership, for which I am incredibly grateful. He is as much of a parent to our children as I am. He is as much of a contributor to our household as I am. And I don’t think any of the things that I have accomplished would have been possible if he viewed our relationship differently, or expected something other than that from me. And as a result, I sometimes get a little bit irritated when I hear people talking about work/life balance as exclusively the province of women. My husband cares as much as I do about getting to spend time with our&nbsp;children­—about&nbsp;having work he’s passionate about, but also being able to&nbsp;be there for our family. There’s nothing unique about that desire. It applies to men just as much as it applies to women. I strive to be as supportive of his career as he has been of mine, and the only way it works is to have the kind of very equal partnership that we have.<\/p><p><strong>RN: What’s the hardest part about your job?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>I have learned that you cannot torture yourself over every single decision you make. My work only very rarely is going to hinge on one or two make-or-break choices. It’s a culmination of thousands of pieces of advice I give, thousands of choices I make, and if I make the right call 90 percent of the time, that’s a pretty excellent track record. I always tell newbie general counsels,&nbsp;“The hardest thing that you will ever have to do in this job is get through that initial paralysis of having to make dozens and dozens of choices every single day. You have to accept the fact that you are not perfect.”<\/p><p><strong>RN: When you joined Airbnb, what surprised you most about the tech world that you didn<\/strong><strong>’<\/strong><strong>t expect?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>Unlike in politics, you can’t yell your way to respect with the people around you. I believe it was Margaret Thatcher who said,&nbsp;“Being powerful is like being a lady. If you have&nbsp;to tell people you are, you aren’t.”&nbsp;That absolutely applies in this context. You have to earn the respect that people have for you. You have to demonstrate that you’re worthy of it through your actions and your contributions. And you have to be respectful to everybody around you.<\/p><p>I have also learned to listen a little bit better than maybe I did in politics, when you got attention by jumping up and down and yelling and just talking louder than the other person. The chief legal officer at Airbnb gave me some excellent advice before I started this job: She told me to spend the first several months just listening to people. It is really hard advice to follow, but it is very good advice. I try to employ it whenever I’m tackling a new issue or thinking through something with someone. You can very easily shut down what would otherwise be incredibly interesting dialogue if you’re the first person to talk. So I strive&nbsp;never&nbsp;to be the first person who talks. I fail often, because it’s my natural proclivity, but I strive.<\/p><p><strong>RN: That’s good counsel for anyone. What's the best advice that you<\/strong><strong>’<\/strong><strong>ve ever gotten, either career-wise or life-wise?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>You should not be afraid of failure. A friend once told me that everybody should be fired early in their career so they can see that their life isn’t over. And I think there’s a lot of truth to that. I often think about ways that I can encourage my own children to try things that they are going to fail at. I actually have this crazy dream—you’re going to laugh at this probably—of someday starting a problem-solving camp. It would be for eight- to ten-year-olds in San Francisco, would involve two or three weeks of free-range play in Golden Gate Park, and would be capped by giving each of them $10, dropping them off in a completely unfamiliar neighborhood with a bus map, and telling them to get home. It’s those sorts of opportunities that are most helpful to someone’s growth and problem solving skills.<\/p><p><strong>RN: What’s a time you felt like you failed, and how did you get past it? <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>Oh, man. I’ve had many failures in life. I think perhaps the most amusing, in retrospect, was this internship I desperately wanted at the White House in 2001. More than wanting it, I felt that I was entitled to have this internship. And when I didn’t get it—and to this day, I remember where I was sitting when I received the call—I was so crushed. I completely lost perspective. I spent several days pitying myself, and I thought that this was going to be so crucial to my career as a young lawyer that I might as well just throw it all away now. As it turns out, I had a great summer doing something else entirely.<\/p><p>Nothing is ever as bad as it seems. And who you become as a person, ethically and morally, depends upon how you react to things that happen. You normally can’t change those things. But you can change how you react to them.<\/p><p>And to speak of additional advice, one of the things that I often say to people is you have to understand what your priorities are before you get into something, or at the commencement of your career. And you have to base your choices around those priorities, whether it’s your religion, your family, your ambition, your desire for material reward, or your health. Those things all compete against one another. You can’t let circumstances make choices for you. Otherwise, you’re going to look in the mirror in ten years and you’re going to hate what you’ve become.<\/p><p><strong>RN: We were just talking about professional failure, but you’ve had so many successes in your career. What’s been the proudest moment in your personal life?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>When I was a kid, and I would hear adults say, “My child is my greatest accomplishment,”&nbsp;I can quite clearly remember thinking,&nbsp;“I am not an accomplishment. I am a person.”&nbsp;But it’s&nbsp;my family, it’s my children. There are so many things that they do, whether it’s something they say in the morning that’s funny, or a thoughtful observation they make about life—all of those things make me incredibly proud to watch my two boys (who are five and seven) turn into full-fledged individuals with opinions and thoughts and concerns about the world.<\/p><p><strong>RN: Of the people in your community—your husband, friends, coworkers, parents—whose advice do you rely on most often? <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>My husband’s. He’s a great counterpoint to me. He’s the sort of person whose feathers can’t easily be ruffled. And when I’ve gotten myself worked up about a problem, or I’m really focused on something, he’s very good at giving me perspective and providing a little bit of an outsider’s viewpoint. Among my flaws, one of them is sometimes losing the forest for the trees, and he’s very good at bringing me back up to that second level and allowing me not to become so wrapped around something.<\/p><p><strong>RN: Did you have a mentor along the way? <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>Absolutely. And because I think mentors are so key, I’ve really tried to provide that same sort of mentorship to other people. But I had a couple of really wonderful mentors early on in my career. One is David Israelite, who is now the head of the National Music Publishers’&nbsp;Association. He was really crucial in the early stages of my career, helping me make the right choices and giving me opportunities that it would have been difficult for someone as young as I was to get on my own. Having a real mentor, one you’ve actually worked with, and who trusts and knows your work, is incredibly crucial. It’s harder to get that sort of mentorship from just calling someone up and saying, “Will you go to lunch and talk to me about my career?”<\/p><p><strong>RN: What’s your go-to to rejuvenate after a really stressful period at work? <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>I love to go for hikes or really long walks where I can just put in my earbuds and listen to a book or a podcast or music and then just be in the zone for a few hours. By nature, I am an introvert, so I occasionally need those times of solitude to really recharge myself. <\/p><p><strong>RN: What are some of your favorite podcasts? <\/strong><\/p><p>I listen to <em>Criminal<\/em>, which I really love. I’m obsessed with <em>This American Life<\/em>. <em>Mystery Show<\/em> I really like—the goal for each show is for her to solve a mystery without using the Internet. You should listen to it.<\/p><p><strong>RN: How do you make sure you’re the kind of person younger women in the field can look up to? <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>KB:&nbsp;<\/strong>I think the best mentors I’ve had have been candid with me, so&nbsp;I try to be very candid when I’m providing advice to people.&nbsp;And when I see them engaging in great success, I try to make sure to congratulate them and tell them how proud I am of the things they have accomplished. I want to be there not just to help them with problems and failures, but also in times of success.<\/p><p>I also try to show through actions that women can be successful. The best compliment I ever have received in my career was from a young woman on the Romney campaign. She said to me, after the campaign was over, “You have shown me that it’s possible to have it all, and it’s possible to be respected in the workplace, and it’s possible to be a woman who can be ambitious, and who also has a family and can try to balance all those things.”&nbsp;And I laugh, because from the outside it may look like that—these things are never perfect behind the scenes. But that meant a lot to me, because I really do strive to show younger women, by my actions, how you can be successful in male-dominated worlds by just being yourself.<\/p><p><em>Illustration: <a href=\"http://www.debutart.com/artist/sam-kerr\">Sam Kerr<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202400025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202400025ce","primaryImageId":"ci01efcdd920012606","path":"/2016/06/katie-biber-empowered-women-interview-women-in-politics-silicon-valley-airbnb-having-it-all","associatedRichTerms":[{"isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-05-23T16:30:28Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci020b7202400025ce","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Culture","primaryImage":{"height":796,"cloudinaryVersionId":1446480293,"id":"ci01dca46270019512","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Culture Section Heading","primaryPhotoId":"ci01dca46270019512","hasFaces":true,"width":1410,"publicId":"assets/MTM0MTYyODMwODAxODI1NzYy","format":"jpg","bytes":132588,"migrationId":"313fa576c8d9dd8d99b57b4c92a3729e32f75448"},"vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:sections","editedTimestamp":"2017-08-29T15:15:51Z","disqusId":"2124d5ea-3fd5-11e7-af36-06e903dde794","primaryImageId":"ci01dca46270019512","path":"/culture","slug":"culture","displayName":"Culture","migrationId":"section-transition-ci01db2dc6f0009512"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0a9f0019512"},{"$ref":"ci01e046c950002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0aa10009512"},{"$ref":"ci0201534ac0002462"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0c750002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0ef0001c80a"}],"socialPopularity":988,"featuredMediaId":"ci01efcdd920012606","slug":"katie-biber-empowered-women-interview-women-in-politics-silicon-valley-airbnb-having-it-all","contentNodeId":"cn01eec71d20002560","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2016-06-27T15:49:29Z","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2016-06-27T15:49:29Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01f0402640002606","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","isNoindex":false,"title":"Rebecca Nelson","slug":"rnelson","disqusId":"aab55623-3c7b-11e6-adf8-0286c773d095","twitterUsername":"rebeccanelson","website":"http://www,rebeccarosenelson.com","bio":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Rebecca Nelson is a&nbsp;freelance&nbsp;writer based in Washington, D.C.

If it’s an area in which you spend time making and creating, it is <em>your <\/em>space.<\/p><p><a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/241842\"><em>Entrepreneur<\/em><\/a> reminds us that messy spaces create messy thoughts. Take some time after each task to put things back where they belong. Simply tucking away extra pens and papers can work wonders. This will eliminate future accumulation and, inevitably, more overwhelming feelings.  <\/p><p>I, for one, have quite the craft supplies stash. In the New Year, it is my personal goal to always return supplies to their proper home once I’m done with them. By doing so, I’ll clear a path for the next project. <\/p><h2>02. JOURNAL<\/h2><p>For a creative person, a journal is more than just a pad of paper. It’s a best friend, a therapist, and a partner-in-crime. It’s here to save the day.  <\/p><p>Just as your space needs room to breathe, so too do our minds. For an overwhelmed brain, a journal is the perfect storage unit.<\/p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&amp;ContentID=4552\">University of Rochester Medical Center<\/a>&nbsp;shares that journaling is an important tool for managing mental and emotional health. A journal serves as a healthy outlet that reduces stress, anxiety, and depression. <\/p><p>Whether you’re a hobbyist or a professional artist, when your talent becomes part of your day to day, it can easily feel like a responsibility instead of a blessing. Journaling gives you a chance to appreciate your creativity in a different context.<\/p><h2>03. MAKE A LIST<\/h2><p>A busy woman’s arsenal isn’t complete without a to-do list. This tool is perfect for ordering your brain’s clutter.<\/p><p>Thanks to technology, you can create a to-do list with a few clicks of a button. <a href=\"https://evernote.com/?var=2\">Evernote<\/a> is popular. But apps such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://todoist.com/\">Todoist<\/a>&nbsp;(distraction-free design), <a href=\"https://www.wunderlist.com/\">Wunderlist<\/a>&nbsp;(collaborate and share), and <a href=\"http://mysterioustrousers.com/calvetica/\">Calvetica<\/a>&nbsp;(costs $2.99, but it’s fast, fast, fast!) are other options.<\/p><p>Or go old-school with a pen and paper. Nothing beats the satisfying feeling of crossing off a task. But be careful not to turn mental clutter into material clutter, so keep a recycling bin nearby, or contain the lists in a single notebook.<\/p><h2>04. FINISH SOMETHING . . . ANYTHING<\/h2><p>The key to easing an overactive mind is getting just one thing done. It can be anything: sending an invoice or finishing an outline. Pick one, and go for it. Getting started is half the battle.<\/p><p>There will always be something that needs to get done. Remind yourself that the best you can do is kick this one’s butt before moving on to the next one. You’re only human.<\/p><p>If necessary, start with small administrative tasks: clearing out your inbox, organizing receipts, or tidying your space. This will clear the path for more important tasks.<\/p><p>Fortunately, this system isn’t about all work and no play. Completing a side project can work wonders for a creative mind. It’s the perfect way to take a break while kindling your creative flame.<\/p><h2>05. DO SOMETHING CREATIVE FOR YOURSELF<\/h2><p>Todd Henry, author of <a href=\"http://www.toddhenry.com/theaccidentalcreative/\"><em>The Accidental Creative<\/em><\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.toddhenry.com/louderthanwords/\"><em>Louder Than Words<\/em><\/a>, discusses this concept in his podcast episode titled “<a href=\"http://www.accidentalcreative.com/podcasts/ac/podcast-the-necessity-of-unnecessary-creating/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+accidentalcreative%2Fpodcast+%28The+Accidental+Creative%29&amp;utm_content=FeedBurner\">The Necessity of Unnecessary Creating<\/a>.” Henry reminds us that creating for yourself means making something that, rather than being seen, judged, or edited, is created for the sake of personal growth and development. <\/p><p>Finishing a personal project (not for work, family, or someone else) is the perfect release for creative overflow. It all comes down to learning how to let yourself snag some creative “me” time. Again, my workaholic tendencies love to nudge this option out of sight. Another New Year’s resolution for me? You bet. <\/p><h2>06. DON’T MULTITASK<\/h2><p>When you’ve got a million things on your plate, multitasking might seem like the best plan of attack.&nbsp;But here’s where things get tricky. According to researchers at <a href=\"http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/multitask.htm\">Ohio State University<\/a>, the benefits of multitasking are just that: feelings. People often take on multiple tasks at once because it makes them feel better about themselves, providing an emotional boost.<\/p><p>Productivity, on the other hand, is more likely to nose-dive. The <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask.aspx\">American Psychological Association<\/a> shares that cognitive function is inhibited when the mind experiences task-switching. As a result, efficiency decreases. It is estimated that multitasking can steal up to 40 percent of an individual’s productivity. Yikes!<\/p><p>The bottom line? Do one thing at a time. This also means staying away from the TV, social media, and phone calls while you do your thing. Close unnecessary browsers. Yes, that means Facebook and Pinterest (and your email). As a rule of thumb, if your creative energy doesn’t currently need it, keep it out of sight.<\/p><p>Hopefully, with these six tips, you’ll be able to better handle your plethora of creative ideas. Start slowly. It takes practice and time. With the right mindset and habits, you can pave the way for your most refreshing, creative, and productive year yet.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a

tml-version=\"2\" --><p><a href=\"javascript:;\"><\/a><a href=\"javascript:;\"><\/a>Whether it’s right before a presentation or when facing&nbsp;a difficult conversation, we’ve all had our confidence take a nosedive at one point or another. “<em>I<\/em><em>’<\/em><em>ll mess up<\/em>,” you might tell yourself. Or,&nbsp;“<em>I won<\/em><em>’<\/em><em>t know what to say<\/em>.” It’s easy to feel discouraged. So how do you push your&nbsp;<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2014/08/conquer-self-doubt-tips-for-confidence-and-career-success\">self-doubt<\/a>&nbsp;aside and feel good about yourself in a challenging&nbsp;situation?<\/p><p>You probably know someone who radiates confidence&nbsp;and doesn’t seem to be&nbsp;phased by&nbsp;life’s many curveballs. How does she build self-esteem for success at work and in life? I posed my questions to some women in my own life whose self-confidence is just right. They shared six of&nbsp;their tried-and-true tips on how to be more confident.<\/p><h2>01. Know Your Values and Stick to Them<\/h2><p>Over brunch, my friend Kara who works for a supplier and contract company shared how sticking to her values at work helped her stay confident in her long-term goals. When a large company contacted her organization to help plan an event, Kara didn’t hesitate to say yes. But, “My boss was less enthused,” she said. “He was unsure of the time, money, and additional resources that would be used and if it would be a good return on our investment.” Kara stuck to her belief that the initial legwork would pay off, and it did. After a successful partnership, a vice president&nbsp;working on the project was promoted and has become a champion of Kara’s organization and their mission. When you’re feeling discouraged, remind yourself of your values and why you believe in them. They might just be the inspiration and motivation&nbsp;you need to boost your self-confidence.<\/p><h2>02. Get Enough Sleep<\/h2><p>Sleep is essential to boosting and maintaining confidence throughout the day. Getting enough sleep is <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sdd/why\">shown<\/a> to be critical to maintaining your physical and psychological health. Not getting enough sleep can <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/reneesylvestrewilliams/2012/07/31/how-a-lack-of-sleep-affects-your-work/#cbbeb4a69d25\">negatively affect<\/a> your ability to learn, make decisions, and manage your emotions.&nbsp;So it makes sense that getting enough quality sleep can build and maintain confidence. Busy mom, Jocelyn,&nbsp;says, “Everything, including our outlook on ourselves and our confidence, is bleaker when we’re overtired!” So don’t underestimate the power of a good night’s sleep.<\/p><h2>03. Make a List of Your Victories, Big and Small<\/h2><p>Kaitlin, a former project manager and new mom, shares,&nbsp;“Listing my accomplishments really helps boost my confidence.\" She recommends using this strategy when you are feeling negative or down about yourself or your abilities. Michaela, a busy stay-at-home mom, agrees, saying, “I used to get down on myself for how much work I still had left at the end of the day. My husband would point out what I did get done, and I began to realize my accomplishments were actually abundant.” Being mindful of what you've&nbsp;accomplished so far—even the little things!—will&nbsp;combat self-doubt and help you build&nbsp;self-compassion to get through <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2017/02/self-compassion-getting-through-tough-times-kristin-neff\">hard times<\/a>.<\/p><h2>04. Celebrate Your Successes with a Friend<\/h2><p>No, sharing your accomplishments isn’t necessarily bragging. Take, for example, my friend Sylvia’s strategy. When faced with a difficult situation, Sylvia makes an intentional decision to face the situation with confidence. Then, she resolves to&nbsp;tell a friend about it so that her friend can celebrate her success with her. And when her friends share their own successes with her, Sylvia says, she&nbsp;can provide affirmation and boost their confidence too. So grab a friend and support each other’s self-esteem!<\/p><h2>05. Give Yourself a Pep Talk<\/h2><p>Jaclyn, an academic advisor by day and a fitness instructor by night, swears by the power of standing in front of a mirror and <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/04/confidence-boosters-affirmations-optimism-imposter-syndrome-happiness-stress\">saying positive affirmations<\/a>&nbsp;out loud. “It sounds corny,” she says, “but it truly makes a difference!” Think of it as giving yourself a little pep talk. In my psychotherapy practice, I’ll tell my clients that they have to be their own motivational coaches. Don’t let yourself be discouraged. Remind yourself of your positive qualities, your values, and your goals. Fun dance moves are optional, of course.<\/p><h2>06. Think of Yourself as You Think of Others<\/h2><p>Sometimes, when you’re feeling unconfident, it could be that you are simply being too hard on yourself. My friend Monica shares, “I try to imagine that other people are evaluating me the way I evaluate them, which generally involves cutting them a lot of slack. Whether it’s true or not, it makes me feel better.” Reminding yourself that others aren’t judging you as harshly as you think they might be (or at all), can help you feel less anxious and more confident about yourself.<\/p><p>It’s tough to keep your confidence high when life has a habit of throwing you curveballs.&nbsp;So the next time you’re not feeling good about yourself, try one of these simple confidence-boosting tips. A healthy boost in your self-esteem might just be a handwritten list, a phone call to a friend, or a pep talk in the mirror away!<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"https://stock.adobe.com/\">Adobe Stock<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202500025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202500025ce","primaryImageId":"ci020474b870002637","path":"/2017/02/how-to-build-self-confidence","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01e38f4a5000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d3200199de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0e230002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01df0c5a30002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d32006c80a"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202500025ce"},{"$ref":"ci01ec315fa00025a7"},{"$ref":"ci01d0dfe6c0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0abf0022a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0a9f0019512"},{"$ref":"ci01e14bd26000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0ca400099de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0ab1001efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d33001efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0eac000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01e08c9580002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci0204744120002711"}],"socialPopularity":73,"featuredMediaId":"ci020474b870002637","slug":"how-to-build-self-confidence","contentNodeId":"cn020471bed0002637","authorProfile":{"$ref":"ci01cec0ad7000c80a"},"teaser":"No, sharing your accomplishments isn’t necessarily bragging.","promoTitle":"6 Tips from Real Women on How to Feel Good About Yourself at Work and in Life","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":12.4463,"lastCount":12},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":2.85376,"lastCount":2},"facebook":{"acceleration":-7.46498e-14,"velocity":9.21689e-20,"estimate":59.4765,"lastCount":59},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0}},"dek":"No, sharing your accomplishments isn’t necessarily bragging.","featuredMedia":{"$ref":"ci020474b870002637"},"ownerId":null,"metaTitle":"6 Tips from Real Women on How to Build Self-Confidence at Work and in Life"},{"authorProfileId":"ci01f35034f00024e8","isInstantArticle":true,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-03-10T11:55:00Z","sectionIds":[["ci020b7202500025ce"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci0204c388f0002637","objectType":"ContentArticle","terms":[{"$ref":"ci01cec0d32006c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01e046c950002a83"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:30:28Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01cec0b44000efe2","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"depression","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-05-18T02:30:28Z","disqusId":"d8e0dbc2-fd05-11e4-98c0-001ec9b1277e","path":"/tag/depression/","slug":"depression","displayName":"depression"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0ca400099de"},{"$ref":"ci01e08c9580002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0a9f0019512"},{"$ref":"ci01d0dfe6c0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01d0dfc9700099de"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-09-23T01:24:14Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01d94bbbe00099de","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Anxiety","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-09-23T01:24:14Z","disqusId":"cce00456-6191-11e5-aebb-001ec9b1277e","path":"/tag/anxiety/","slug":"anxiety","displayName":"Anxiety","promoTitle":"Anxiety"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0eac000c80a"}],"isNoindex":false,"title":"How to Handle Success at a Young Age, Whether You Have It or Want It","primaryImage":{"height":600,"cloudinaryVersionId":1489072610,"id":"ci020542e63000251d","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"success-young-age-lifestyle","primaryPhotoId":"ci020542e63000251d","hasFaces":false,"width":1200,"publicId":"MTQ1NTk2MTE4ODM3NzY1NDA1","format":"png","bytes":1420576},"editedTimestamp":"2017-03-10T11:56:06Z","disqusId":"c852cb01-001c-11e7-9a04-0282c98184b7","autoSaved":false,"tmlEmbeds":[],"sectionsLeafNode":["ci020b7202500025ce"],"bodyTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>At the 2017 Oscars we watched two young Hollywood stars take home top honors: a barely 32-year-old Damien Chazelle won Best Director, and 28-year-old Emma Stone won Best Actress, both for&nbsp;<em>La La Land<\/em>. Chazelle now holds the record for the youngest person ever to win in his category; the average age of recipients is 46.<\/p><p>While these wins are exciting and deserved, they beg the question: Where do they go from here?&nbsp;Is rapid success something young people aspire to without realizing its potential to derail a long, fulfilling career?&nbsp;At the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt48-80rrSAhWDSyYKHToaBjkQFggaMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.millennial20-20.com%2Findex%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHI_7AgyDSNK9EtMOJQUS8RdylCHA&amp;bvm=bv.148747831,d.eWE\">Millennial 20/20 Summit<\/a> held in New York City last week, it was widely discussed that&nbsp;lists such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4o_G3sbvSAhUE7CYKHYDvD3UQFggrMAM&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2F30-under-30-2017%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5GRQjPXBwNsRP-GJz2ZoUKL-5HA\">Forbes' \"30 Under 30\"<\/a> didn't even exist until five years ago. Before then, no one with less than three decades behind them was expected to own a multi-million-dollar company or make major innovations. Not anymore. This generation's working class wants success, and we want it fast. But what happens when we get it?<\/p><h2>Can early success mean long-term failure?<\/h2><p>No one is suggesting that the Taylor Swifts and Mark Zuckerbergs of the world opt out of their achievement just because it came early. But for some, success brings complications. Actress Sarah Paulson, 42, (<em>12 Years a Slave<\/em>, <em>The People v. O. J. Simpson<\/em>) recently told <em><a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/unexpected-sarah-paulson\" rel=\"nofollow\">GQ<\/a><\/em> that she's thankful her success didn't come too soon. \"If <em>any<\/em> of what I'm having happen now—the successes—would have happened to me when I was younger, I would have been ruined,\" she told the magazine. \"Because when you're young, and things come super-easily to you, and you have success right out of the gate, you're liable to think that's how it actually works.\"<\/p><p>National Board Certified Counselor and Licensed Mental Health Therapist&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.groundworkcounseling.com/\">Marion Rodrigue<\/a>&nbsp;says that often she sees clients who, similar to Chazelle or Stone, experienced big&nbsp;achievements at a young age, manifest&nbsp;disorders of anxiety, depression, and narcissism, as well as perfectionism and fear of failure. Alone or in tandem, these conditions can make maintaining that success or attaining future accolades&nbsp;taste more bitter than sweet.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>How common is this phenomenon among millennials?<\/h2><p>When you think of people who may&nbsp;be facing post-success symptoms, there's no shortage of high-profile names. Take&nbsp;2016 for instance: then-17-year-old Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize; at 26, Taylor Swift won Album of the Year at the Grammys; the musical <em>Hamilton<\/em>&nbsp;written by millennial outlier, Lin-Manuel Miranda (then only 36), won ten Tony Awards; and then-31-year-old swimmer Michael Phelps won his twenty-third Olympic gold medal in Rio, putting him well above the previous record of nine golds. In pop culture and in society at large, there is no shortage of young people basking in achievement right now. And there's ten-fold more wondering, \"<em>Why not me?<\/em>\"&nbsp;<\/p><p>Rodrigue says&nbsp;a lot of younger clients in her practice struggle with the expectation that they shouldn't have to start small. They expect high-earning, top-rung positions right out of college, she says. If this doesn't happen quickly for them, they tend to give up. Of course we know that the likes of Michael Phelps worked really hard for their honors, but for many, success is just as much about work as it is right-time, right-place luck. That can be hard to face.<\/p><p>\"The best advice we can give young people is that it takes time to figure out the intricacies of life,\" Rodrigue says. \"In order to grow emotionally, we all need to be able to handle set-backs, rejection, and failures—this is what makes us resilient.\" Sometimes too much success too soon can prevent us from experiencing the necessary prerequisites for endurance and fortitude.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>What can we do about it?<\/h2><p>Rodrigue shares that people who hit big milestones early in life often fear they might be a \"one hit wonder\" or&nbsp;feel hollow because there isn't a clear benchmark ahead of them. To combat this, she advises clients to focus on&nbsp;not taking their achievements&nbsp;for granted. \"It's important to remain humble and acknowledge that this success is likely due to hard work, combined with unique, positive circumstances and opportunities that contributed to a certain serendipity,\" she notes.<\/p><p>Whether you fall into the prodigy category or the still-living-at-home-with-my-parents camp,&nbsp;you must see success for what it is not: the end all, be all. Rodrigue says, \"[T]o be sustainably happy and fulfilled, we must develop intrinsic self-worth and unconditional self-acceptance, which allows us to love our self and be happy even when we fail in some way or don’t receive praise and recognition from outside sources.\" Of <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/07/lies-twentysomethings-need-to-stop-believing-young-adults\">the lies millennials need to stop believing<\/a>, \"I should be successful by now!\" should&nbsp;be near the top of your list. &nbsp;<\/p><p>Whether you're&nbsp;just starting your career or&nbsp;are&nbsp;a few years into your field, don't worry that just because you aren't a \"30 Under 30\" you aren't on track. Working hard is great, but relying only on outside measures of success won't bode well for your&nbsp;longterm&nbsp;health and happiness. Taylor Swift told <a href=\"http://time.com/3580915/taylor-swift-album-success-millennials/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>TIME<\/em><\/a>, \"The only thing I compare myself to is me, two years ago, or me one year ago.\" Whether you're a world-famous artist or a third-year school teacher, that's good advice we can get on board with. As long as you're self-reflective and growing in your own right, you'll find the fulfillment you seek.&nbsp;<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lexcop/\">Alexi Copley<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202500025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202500025ce","primaryImageId":"ci020542e63000251d","path":"/2017/03/secret-to-success-in-life-timing","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01cec0d32006c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01e046c950002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0b44000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0ca400099de"},{"$ref":"ci01e08c9580002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0a9f0019512"},{"$ref":"ci01d0dfe6c0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202500025ce"},{"$ref":"ci01d0dfc9700099de"},{"$ref":"ci01d94bbbe00099de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0eac000c80a"}],"socialPopularity":33,"featuredMediaId":"ci020542e63000251d","slug":"secret-to-success-in-life-timing","contentNodeId":"cn0204c388f0002637","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2016-08-03T19:32:51Z","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2016-08-03T19:32:51Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01f35034f00024e8","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","isNoindex":false,"title":"Megan Madden","slug":"megan-madden","disqusId":"05292f48-59b1-11e6-8dc3-0256cc88f685","path":"/author/megan-madden"},"teaser":"Expert advice for what to do whether you’re Taylor Swift or sleeping on your friend’s couch","promoTitle":"This One Secret to Success in Life Isn’t What You Might Think","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":5.41756e-28,"velocity":0,"estimate":3.46618,"lastCount":3},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"facebook":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":30.6376,"lastCount":29},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":1.45809,"lastCount":1}},"dek":"Expert advice for what to do whether you’re Taylor Swift or sleeping on your friend’s couch","featuredMedia":{"$ref":"ci020542e63000251d"},"ownerId":null,"metaTitle":"One Secret to Success in Life Is Timing"},{"authorProfileId":"ci01cec0ee6000c80a","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2016-10-19T09:00:00Z","sectionIds":[["ci020b7202500025ce"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01f922f30000240b","objectType":"ContentArticle","terms":[{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-12-21T20:45:45Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01e0b2178000c80a","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Long Form","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-12-21T20:45:44Z","disqusId":"ce8b0188-a823-11e5-9378-00221960550f","path":"/tag/long-form/","slug":"long-form","displayName":"Long Form","promoTitle":"Long Form"},{"$ref":"ci01d0dfe6c0002a83"},{"isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2016-10-05T21:54:17Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01f883309000243f","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Health","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2016-10-05T21:54:18Z","disqusId":"435df65f-8b46-11e6-9a78-021063195927","path":"/tag/health-96/","slug":"health-96","displayName":"Health","promoTitle":"Health"},{"$ref":"ci01e14bd26000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0eac000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01e08c9580002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0019512"}],"isNoindex":false,"title":"Discover the French Secret to Happiness by Practicing This Habit Today","primaryImage":{"height":667,"cloudinaryVersionId":1476711187,"defaultCaption":"","id":"ci01f978f950002756","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"alexa-fernando-6.jpeg","primaryPhotoId":"ci01f978f950002756","width":1000,"publicId":"MTQyMjc3ODc0ODg2Mzg3NTQy","format":"jpg","bytes":480576},"editedTimestamp":"2016-10-19T10:01:02Z","disqusId":"d8b05173-9139-11e6-ba0a-0262f66792b7","autoSaved":false,"tmlEmbeds":[],"sectionsLeafNode":["ci020b7202500025ce"],"bodyTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>When I think of the word “discipline,” smiles certainly don’t come to mind.

With a new baby,  I recently finished the book <em>Bringing Up Bébé&nbsp;<\/em>by Pamela Druckerman—who discusses how a core component of French parenting&nbsp;generally focuses on forming a child’s self-discipline. The French believe that this is an imperative foundation, which makes a happy, healthy child&nbsp;and in turn makes a happy, healthy adult.<\/p><p>Turns out, the French are on to something. <\/p><p>“Yes—discipline actually makes people happier,” shares&nbsp;<a href=\"http://t.sidekickopen17.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs8qC8bbN64R07Rd0yCYW2zGrQM56dRrff76Rlq-02?t=http%3A%2F%2Fjillprince.com%2F&amp;si=5768555120820224&amp;pi=c4560483-494f-4d10-e9e2-b05c8a1a8041\">Jill M. Prince<\/a>,&nbsp;MBA, CHC, certified health coach and stress management consultant.&nbsp;“And science backs this fact up.”<\/p><p>When we’re undisciplined, we’re actually living in a crisis-response mode, which means we overproduce cortisol, the toxic stress hormone. “Each time the stress response system is activated, our bodies stay in fight-or-flight survival mode for two to three hours before the blood reaches a saturation level and the cortisol tap is turned off,”&nbsp;Prince states. Meanwhile, our mind is&nbsp;stressed, and our body’s&nbsp;main systems—such as digestion, immune function, libido, memory, and concentration—can stall or shut off. Needless to say, this on-and-off way of living can be exhausting.<\/p><p>“If our cortisol tap is turned on several times each day, we are most definitely <em>not<\/em> happy.”<\/p><p>On the other hand, those who do practice&nbsp;self-discipline reap many biochemical rewards. Prince says, “The human body produces a cocktail of happy brain chemicals in response to the various motivators. The four happiness chemicals (neurotransmitters and neurosteroids) are oxytocin (love and trust), endorphin (joy, pain reduction), dopamine (rewards), and serotonin (respect).”<\/p><p>She’s noticed that when people adopt self-discipline, “their lives become simplified.&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;[they] set and accomplish goals more often. When we accomplish goals, we get big doses of happy brain chemicals.”<\/p><p>But it’s a balance.<\/p><p>Kim Castle, a woman’s well-being advocate and founder of <a href=\"http://t.sidekickopen17.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs8qC8bbN64R07Rd0yCYW2zGrQM56dRrff76Rlq-02?t=https%3A%2F%2Flifelicious.me%2F&amp;si=5768555120820224&amp;pi=c4560483-494f-4d10-e9e2-b05c8a1a8041\">Lifelicious<\/a>,&nbsp;shares that self-discipline can do all kinds of things for our happiness, but we also can’t blindly ignore our intuition and adhere to inflexibility. “I wholeheartedly say that self-discipline can make you happier. It streamlines your attention and helps to clear away chaos and overwhelm,” Castle says. Yet, like all things, we need to be balanced in our approach to discipline.  “As a recovered adrenal fatigue,&nbsp;type A&nbsp;exercise addict, it can also run you into the ground by not listening to the needs of your body, especially for women.”<\/p><p>She has found that those who practice a ratio of approximately 30 to 40 percent&nbsp;of mental capacity focused (self-discipline) and the remaining open to flow, joy, and intuition are happiest.&nbsp;“This balance helps us get more things done with ease, and we are happier and healthier,”&nbsp;Castle says.<\/p><p>Karen R. Koenig, MEd, LCSW, is a nonfiction author of six books, a psychotherapist, and a blogger, whose specialty is in eating disorders, agrees with this balanced approach. She shares that “self-discipline is not one skill&nbsp;but a skill set.” This skill set is composed of two aspects: gratification, which is&nbsp;short-term positive feelings, and happiness, long-term positive feelings. The first is an “ability to tolerate frustration and keep persisting toward a goal by overcoming barriers and staying focused.” The second is “the ability to <em>delay gratification<\/em> to move past hard or uncomfortable work or feelings to reach a goal that’s down the road.”<\/p><p>Happy people have both of these skills—and they use them effectively.<\/p><p>If  your life could use a little bit more schedule&nbsp;and a little less free-for-all, Koenig has some practical suggestions: “Start by practicing tolerating frustration—sticking with something difficult for ten minutes, then fifteen, then an hour, then a day, etc.” She says that by learning to delay gratification, we learn how to self-soothe, visualize goals, and enjoy feeling proud for not taking&nbsp;the easy way out. <\/p><p>On a fundamental level, we can become masters of ourselves simply by taking on a different mindset:<\/p><p>“People also need to change their beliefs about self-discipline and stop seeing it as something which takes away fun&nbsp;but rather as something which brings happiness.” In other words, we need to remember that saying&nbsp;no&nbsp;to something in front of us means saying yes&nbsp;to another future goal.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"http://www.ajfernando.com/\">Alexa Fernando<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202500025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202500025ce","primaryImageId":"ci01f978f950002756","path":"/2016/10/bringing-up-bebe-pamela-druckerman-self-discipline-french-habits","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01e0b2178000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01d0dfe6c0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01f883309000243f"},{"$ref":"ci01e14bd26000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202500025ce"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0eac000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01e08c9580002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0019512"}],"socialPopularity":260,"featuredMediaId":"ci01f978f950002756","slug":"bringing-up-bebe-pamela-druckerman-self-discipline-french-habits","contentNodeId":"cn01f922f30000240b","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2015-09-29T13:48:48Z","publicationTimestamp":"2015-09-29T13:48:48Z","id":"ci01cec0ee6000c80a","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","title":"Maria Walley","slug":"mwalley","disqusId":"862b6884-66eb-11e5-be2e-0022195fd05d","twitterUsername":"overthemap","email":"mwalley@verilymag.com","website":"http://kandid.ly","bio":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>After sharpening her teeth in the advertising and marketing world of Chicago, Maria has followed her entrepreneurial spirit by establishing a startup in Austin called <a href=\"http://kandid.ly\">Kandid.ly<\/a>—an online marketplace where anyone can find, book, or become a photographer.

Our friend who just so happened to be at the right place at the perfect time. The one who snagged that incredible discount—all while avoiding red lights along the way. Whether she routinely wins raffles, triumphs at work, or seems to have great luck in the dating scene, there’s just <em>something<\/em> about her that screams sunshine, pots of gold, and bright green four leaf clovers.<\/p><p>Notably, some of my friends seem to exude this kind of luck more than others. Do they have some sort of superstitious ritual that aligns the stars or is it simply<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2012/02/the-genetics-of-luck/\"> genetic<\/a>? When I think about their <em>behavior<\/em> though, I’ve realized that their luck derives less from magic, and more from pragmatism. Their habits are fundamentally different than your average Joe, often going in the face of logic.<\/p><p>Psychologist Dr. Richard Wiseman professor and author of<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Luck-Factor-Essential-Principles/dp/1401359418\"> The Luck Factor: The Four Essential Principles<\/a>, places “luck” under scientific analysis and examines the behavior of lucky people vs. not-so-lucky people. Interestingly, according to him, mastering the ways to tap into your inner “luck” isn’t too difficult—but it does involve practice and rebuilding certain luck-inducing habits. However, it’s worth noting that his findings sometimes contrast the typical advice we’re given to achieve “success.”<\/p><h2>01. Lucky people chill out.<\/h2><p>Being a focused, hard worker is great, but sometimes people put blinders on, putting themselves out of a “lucky” position. According to Richard Wiseman, lucky people are relaxed and open. They are skilled at creating, noticing, and acting upon potential opportunities. The typical hustle and bustle business culture seems to believe that single-minded pursuits can conquer all (“I make my own luck!”) and that hard work alone can plow through anything. Rather, we should work hard <em>and<\/em> have a more open, go-with-the-flow kind of attitude to see \"lucky\" opportunities.<\/p><p>In an<a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/46732/how-make-your-own-luck\"> interview<\/a> with <em>Fast Company<\/em> from several years ago, Wiseman explains:<\/p><p>“This is one of the most counterintuitive ideas. We are traditionally taught to be really focused, really driven, to try really hard at tasks. But in the real world, you’ve got opportunities all around you—and if you’re driven in one direction, you’re not going to spot the others. It’s about getting people to have various game plans running in their head.”<\/p><p>He then describes a scene that I find all-too-familiar. A person goes to a party with one goal: to find their one true love. A lot of hope and hype is injected into the situation, and—as odds would have it—they end up failing to find their one-and-only. On the other hand, a luck-oriented person wouldn’t approach a party with such single-mindedness. Instead, they would choose to relax, be open, and simply meet people. Maybe from <em>there, <\/em>they can meet their one-true-love, but it’s not at the forefront of their mind. At their core, they’re less idealistic, and more opportunistic. They adapt to what’s going on in their situation, which opens them up to the opportunities that exist right in front of them—not in their mind.<\/p><h2>02. Lucky people know how to listen to their gut.<\/h2><p>Lucky people know themselves, listen to themselves, and, ultimately, trust themselves. This means putting aside logical reasoning and following those pesky gut feelings. Wiseman describes this lucky principle as the ability to “listen to those lucky hunches.” In one survey, Wiseman shared that almost 90 percent of those deemed “lucky” said that they trusted their intuition when it came to their relationships, and 80 percent of them said that same intuition was involved in their career choices.<\/p><p>This is strikingly different from the results of those considered “unlucky.” Less than 20 percent of them said that trusting their gut influenced their decisions in relationships and career.<\/p><p>Those lucky hunches are more than a mere “in the moment” feeling Wiseman acknowledges. While lucky people honor their feelings and make decisions based upon intuition, they begin by  taking steps to enhance their intuitive abilities, which helps inhibit fears. For instance, lucky people use meditation, praying, or simply clearing their mind from other thoughts, or petty fears to help make a decision. In other words, there’s a difference between following your intuition vs. following your (more fleeting) feelings.<\/p><h2>03. Lucky people are optimistic—and expect the best.<\/h2><p>Ever heard of a self-fulfilling prophecy? I certainly have—and not in a good way! When I find myself in my most  insecure, frazzled, and relentlessly self-defensive moods, I often channel my brain to “expect the worst,” in hopes of being pleasantly surprised. While this theory might occasionally work, it’s a terrible habit to get into. You’ll begin finding your mind already scanning <em>for<\/em> the worst—causing one to <em>assume<\/em> the worst—as the event unfolds.<\/p><p>In contrast, by “expecting the best,” we train our brains to <em>see<\/em> the best. When we expect  good things to happen to us, we’re more inclined to relax, be open, and take in new experiences—which ultimately leads to taking risks. Being astutely risk-averse is a natural human inclination (fire safety is a good thing!), but refusing to take any kind of chance is ultimately a pessimistic way to live one’s life and doesn’t yield those favorable it-just-<em>happened<\/em>-to-me results.<\/p><h2>04. Lucky people respond to bad situations with grace and gratefulness.<\/h2><p>Sure—objectively bad things happen to everyone. However, Wiseman describes that those who choose to be lucky look at those same “bad things” very differently than those who describe themselves as routinely unlucky. He shares this scenario:<\/p><p><em>“Unlucky people say, ‘I can't believe I've been in another car accident.’ Lucky people go, ‘Wonderful. Yes, I had a car accident, but I wasn't killed.’”<\/em><\/p><p>Simply put: it boils down to what you decide to focus on. Choosing your reactions becomes habitual. “What’s interesting is that both ways of thinking are unconscious and automatic,” shares Wiseman. “It would never occur to the unlucky people to see it a different way.”<\/p><p>I had a friend—let’s call her Patricia (in honor of St. Patty’s Day)—who had some rough medical issues that were extremely unlikely (statistically) and extremely scary. She had every reason to say she had “bad luck.” But instead of wallowing in self-pity, she focused on the things that brought her joy: the people that surrounded her, a carton of fresh strawberries, or long drives through the city with the right music. She saw her experience as an opportunity. She wholly believes that life would continue to bring her joy and beauty.<\/p><p>Wiseman’s research found four psychological techniques that lucky people used to flip their luck:<\/p><ul><li>They see the positives that this “bad” event brought, even if it was just a lesson.<\/li><li>They wholeheartedly believe that poor fortune will turn—that it won’t last forever, and that they’re never ill-fated, or “stuck” with bad luck.<\/li><li>They do not not dwell in unlucky things that have taken place in the past.<\/li><li>They proactively adapt to change their ways to prevent bad things from happening again.<\/li><\/ul><p>There’s a myriad ways you can look at luck. It’s one of the most ancient, yet most intangible concepts that describes human experiences. While no one can really predict the future, we can foster the way we react to the events the future brings—which can make all the difference how we navigate life’s complexities. Meanwhile, I hear wearing green can help? Happy St. Patrick’s Day, and may we all learn to see our luck!<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: Andrea Rose Photography<\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202500025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202500025ce","primaryImageId":"ci01e7c96ac00124a9","path":"/2016/03/make-your-own-luck-happiness-good-luck","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01d0dfe6c0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01df48c110009512"},{"$ref":"ci01e14bd26000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01da56a2100099de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01e08c9580002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01d0dfda90009512"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d32006c80a"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202500025ce"}],"socialPopularity":101,"featuredMediaId":"ci01e7c96ac00124a9","slug":"make-your-own-luck-happiness-good-luck","contentNodeId":"cn01e75c820000271d","authorProfile":{"$ref":"ci01cec0ee6000c80a"},"teaser":"Step aside, four-leaf clover—we can make our own luck.","promoTitle":"4 Things Lucky People Do (That You Can, Too)","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":-6.61156e-15,"velocity":0,"estimate":11.3715,"lastCount":8},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"facebook":{"acceleration":-2.81229e-28,"velocity":0,"estimate":96.0827,"lastCount":93},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0}},"dek":"Step aside, four-leaf clover—we can make our own luck.","featuredMedia":{"$ref":"ci01e7c96ac00124a9"},"ownerId":null},{"authorProfileId":"ci01f80183c0002532","isInstantArticle":true,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-02-08T10:35:00Z","sectionIds":[["ci020b7202500025ce"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci0202752f60002586","objectType":"ContentArticle","terms":[{"$ref":"ci01d94bbbe00099de"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0019512"},{"$ref":"ci01f883309000243f"},{"$ref":"ci01d0dfe6c0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0e3800299de"},{"$ref":"ci01e08c9580002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0a9f0019512"}],"isNoindex":false,"title":"4 Tips You Need to Make Sunday a Day of Rest, Not Stress","primaryImage":{"altText":"rest day, day of rest, sunday, relaxing day, positivity, rest, healthy lifestyle, work life balance","height":1365,"cloudinaryVersionId":1486413712,"id":"ci0202b9c110002576","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"sunday-dayofrest","primaryPhotoId":"ci0202b9c110002576","hasFaces":true,"width":2048,"publicId":"MTQ0ODgyMzc2NjA5MTEzNDYy","format":"jpg","bytes":402102},"editedTimestamp":"2017-02-08T10:36:02Z","disqusId":"c48f61a5-ea1e-11e6-ba55-06dfed2d5f51","autoSaved":false,"tmlEmbeds":[],"sectionsLeafNode":["ci020b7202500025ce"],"bodyTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Most people experience similar emotions by the time Sunday rolls around—the dreaded realization that the <em>weekend is already over<\/em>.

Strategize ahead.<\/h2><p>Ensuring your Sunday can be work-free actually starts on Monday.&nbsp;Fidji Simo, Director of Product at Facebook,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/09/26/productivity-tips-40/\">told <em>Fortune<\/em><\/a><em><\/em> his number one productivity tip: \"Write down your priorities on Monday morning, and rearrange your agenda for the week to make sure it will allow you to address these priorities. If I don’t do this, I find myself reacting to what’s most urgent during the week, instead of focusing on what’s most important.\"<\/p><p>Mother, editor, and&nbsp;<em>Verily<\/em> contributor Lindsay Schlegel also reminds us that making Sunday a day of rest means preparing for it during the rest of your week instead of leaving plans up to the last minute. \"Saturday morning is <em>not<\/em> the time to decide to make Sunday a day of rest.\"&nbsp;Push yourself to wrap up projects and tasks regularly throughout the week so you aren't cramming on Friday and realizing things will have to overflow into the weekend.<\/p><h2>02. Treat yourself.<\/h2><p>You’ll never regret taking care of your mental, physical, and emotional health. There’s no better day to capitalize on this <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/08/me-time-self-care-brene-brown-healthy-breaks-burnout\">priority<\/a> than Sunday. Consider it&nbsp;as both a relaxing closure to the week prior and your revitalizing launch into the&nbsp;week ahead. Rejuvenate and de-stress your mind and body by taking a long bath,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2017/01/short-stories-for-busy-women-to-read\">picking up that book<\/a> you’ve been wanting to read,<a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/verilymag/healthy-eats/\"> perusing Pinterest for a healthy recipes to make for lunches and dinners<\/a>, or writing down some personal, non-work goals and aspirations for the coming week.<\/p><h2>03. Exercise. Or take the day off.<\/h2><p>If your idea of relaxing means going for a five-mile run that you couldn’t squeeze in during your busy weekdays, then so be it! But if exercise brings you more stress than rest, give yourself the day to lay low. Try simple stretches, like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/03/beginners-yoga-moves-get-fit-increase-flexibility\">these easy yoga moves<\/a> to help relax your muscles and your mind so you stress less. Whatever your preference may be—exercising or easing off—make Sunday the day you focus on refreshing&nbsp;your body in the best way it needs.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>04. Go for a Sunday drive or stroll.<\/h2><p>Kovert is a company that designs experiments to see how we are interacting with technology and then creates products to help people balance their tech use. In one study, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3049138/most-creative-people/what-really-happens-to-your-brain-and-body-during-a-digital-detox\">reported by <em>Fast Company<\/em><\/a><em><\/em>, Kovert took a group of business leaders into the Moroccan desert and made them go on a three-day digital detox. As a result, the participants had better posture, made more eye contact, were more conversational with their cohort, got more efficient sleep, and demonstrated better memory.&nbsp;Of course, we can't all do a full-blown detox every weekend, but try to allow for some screen-free time on Sunday. Even a small dose will do a stressed mind and body&nbsp;some good.&nbsp;Leave your phone at home and take to the open road, whether on wheels or on foot for a regular Sunday stroll.<\/p><p>Once upon a time, as Dr. Sleeth recalls to<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/11/health/sleeth-take-day-off/\"> CNN<\/a>, you couldn’t even make purchases on a Sunday because it was considered the day society stopped to rest&nbsp;for a while. Today, our communities are so consumed with 24/7 news cycles and workweeks that we easily forget we need this time to rest and recuperate. Yet a&nbsp;Sunday well spent brings a week of content.
