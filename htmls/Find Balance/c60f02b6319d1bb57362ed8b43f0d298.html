        <p>They say girls just want to have fun, but in reality, everyone wants to have fun.</p>
        <p>Sure, we'd all rather be playing than working, but that’s not plausible for a successful life. Many people I meet are so caught up with their social responsibilities and trying to be part of a crowd that they neglect other aspects of their lives.</p>
        <p>It's all fun and games until you are 35 and have nothing to show for yourself because your life is one big party.&nbsp;Being the life of the party is an "honor" that has a very real expiration date.</p>
        <p>When you can't keep a good balance between work and play, changes must be made. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having a good time, but every once in a while, we need to evaluate whether the good time is getting in the way of a good life.</p>
        <p>Today, I got to thinking about balance and how important it is in order to survive. A lack of balance in your life could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge cause for failure. You reap what you sow and if all you're planting is party seeds, you will have nothing to enjoy but hangovers and blurry nights.</p>
        <p>We are constantly juggling our social and work lives — sometimes,&nbsp;even&nbsp;a love life — but we're multitasking so much that we often forget to be fair to ourselves. While there is a time and a place for everything, there is also a big need for balance in your life. Here are five ways to achieve that:</p>
        <h3>First Thing's First:&nbsp;Prioritize</h3>
        <p>There will always be a big party to go to or a friend's birthday you can’t skip, but sometimes, meeting a work deadline or pulling an extra shift is far more productive and important for achieving your long-term goals.</p>
        <p>A year from now, you won't remember how much fun you had at that party — you may not even remember the week after — but making an impression at work may get you a promotion.</p>
        <p>When choosing between conflicting events, always choose the one that will matter a year from now, or try to find a productive way to do both. Work now; play later!</p>
        <h3>Stay Grounded</h3>
        <p>The social pressures of friends and society can be overwhelming, especially if you're still trying to find yourself and where you fit in a new job or city. Being new to Los Angeles, I know what it's like to try and make friends and try new things while staying true to yourself and your values.</p>
        <p>The best way to maintain a balance between the old and the new is to be open-minded and to stay grounded. Not everything is for everyone.</p>
        <p>If you think that cliques and bullies are only a high school issue, think again! Just because everyone is doing something does not mean that it is right for you. Bring your individuality with you everywhere you go, and no matter what new things you get into, it's never a bad idea to&nbsp;combine a little bit of&nbsp;the old into the new.</p>
        <h3>Be Realistic</h3>
        <p>When we lose touch with the world, we lose our minds — that's a given. The best way to keep a healthy life balance is to always be honest with yourself and others. Always measure your expectations accordingly, meaning don't get your hopes up too soon and don't lose hope too soon, either.</p>
        <p>When you are unrealistic with your wants and needs, you will lose patience because things aren't happening fast enough, or you're not where you thought you'd be.</p>
        <p>This is the fastest way to crash and burn. Know that if you put in the work, results will come. Trust yourself and follow your designated path. Things will start happening&nbsp;the way they should.</p>
        <h3>Spend Your Time Wisely</h3>
        <p>Rushing is my cause for disaster. Murphy's Law is very real and if you're pressed for time, everything that could go wrong will go wrong.&nbsp;Planning ahead is the best way to use&nbsp;your time wisely.</p>
        <p>If you have a day full of meetings before an evening dinner and try to allocate time for everything you need to get done at work, give yourself a buffer of 10 to 30 minutes on everything for unpredictable circumstances. Learn to roll with the punches and be proactive with your time. A big part of being balanced is being on time.</p>
        <h3>Be Moderate</h3>
        <p>Everything in excess is hazardous. Too much alcohol can turn you into an alcoholic and too much food can cause obesity — even too much love can be suffocating. This goes to show that moderation is the key to a happy life. Some things are just too good to pass up, so indulge a little but don't go overboard.</p>
        <p>The harder you work, the more you should treat yourself. I work really hard for everything I have, so indulging in an expensive vacation or a pricey bag doesn't give me much guilt because I know that I've earned it.</p>
        <p>The same applies to everything else in life. When you know you've worked for something, you'll enjoy it even more. Pay your dues and reap the benefits — as long you're responsible, there is no shame in having fun!</p>
