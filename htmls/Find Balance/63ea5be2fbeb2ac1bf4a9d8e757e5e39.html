        <p>No matter the condition of a statue, all are cut from the same stone---similar to humans from genetics. Statues are captivating, even the broken and unfinished ones.</p>
        <p>Like a marble statue, you are a work of art, but it is crucial to remember that you are also a work in progress. And you, too,&nbsp;can chisel yourself into a better person by being productive.</p>
        <p>Even if you don't have your sh*t together, you can still improve your life.&nbsp;Contrary to what you might think, you don’t need&nbsp;Gucci sneakers to take a step in the right direction. You can take that step barefoot.</p>
        <p>You don’t have to start out being the best; you just have to <em>start</em>. Picasso probably played with&nbsp;finger paints&nbsp;before making masterpieces.</p>
        <p>When you’re productive, you&nbsp;can develop other aspects of your life, like your intelligence, relationships, health, creativity and muscles. Do this, and your life will mirror the&nbsp;ones in movies.</p>
        <p>But don't&nbsp;feel pressured to be the next Chris Gardner from "The Pursuit of Happyness." What matters about improving yourself is that you're making yourself your first priority.</p>
        <p>Being productive doesn't just&nbsp;increase your bank account; it&nbsp;amplifies your happiness. It’s the chicken soup for any soul: It sutures a broken heart, alleviates physical pain, and cuts away at&nbsp;boredom -- all while improving your body and mind.</p>
        <p>Who knew blood, sweat and tears could make a potion for happiness?</p>
        <h3>Being productive&nbsp;gives you purpose.</h3>
        <p>Maybe you don’t believe in the Ten Commandments, but you can believe in the 10&nbsp;things on your to-do list.</p>
        <p>No matter your beliefs, you can go to sleep with a dream and wake up with a vision. Having a specific goal can help you skyrocket out of bed in the morning like the firework you are.</p>
        <p>Keep your eye on the prize, and focus on that. When you do this, all of your big-picture problems will blur together. Your happiness level will rise.</p>
        <h3>Being productive&nbsp;keeps your mind active.</h3>
        <p>An active mind is a happy mind. Being busy leaves no time for negative thoughts. You’re not thinking about Phil when&nbsp;you’re teaching yourself Photoshop.</p>
        <p>Learning gives you a reason to live. It greases your gears. It can be a lot of fun to keep up with Kim Kardashian's epic crying face,&nbsp;but be sure to Netflix "Blackfish" (or any other documentary), too.</p>
        <p>In other words, have your sugar, but don't forget to take your vitamins. When it comes to productivity, balance is key.</p>
        <h3>Being productive can increase your quality of life.</h3>
        <p>When you wear your passion like perfume, people -- including your boss! -- will take notice. Being driven is&nbsp;essential&nbsp;to unlocking raises and promotions.</p>
        <p>People say that money doesn’t buy happiness. It doesn’t, but no one is immune to the draw&nbsp;of a comfortable life.&nbsp;With a little extra money, you can&nbsp;upgrade from your spring mattress. You can buy medicine that you might have been going without.</p>
        <p>If you are already living comfortably, you can move to a better apartment or take some time for peace of mind on vacation.</p>
        <h3>Being productive can improve&nbsp;your mood.</h3>
        <p>Productivity translates to different things for different people. For some, it means crossing off dream destinations from your bucket list. For&nbsp;others, it’s&nbsp;something like exercise.</p>
        <p>The Anxiety and Depression Association for America reminds visitors to its <a href="http://www.adaa.org/living-with-anxiety/managing-anxiety/exercise-stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">site</a> that, according to some studies, "regular exercise works as well as medication" for certain people.</p>
        <p>And once you prove that you can be mentally strong in a gym, you know that you can do the same in an office.</p>
        <p>Other de-stressors, like coloring, have become popular as well.&nbsp;Psychologist&nbsp;Gloria Martínez Ayala explained&nbsp;to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/13/coloring-for-stress_n_5975832.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Huffington Post</a>&nbsp;why coloring relieves stress. Businesses have listened: On lower Broadway,&nbsp;the Strand Book Store dedicates&nbsp;several tables to adult coloring books.</p>
        <p>So, whether you're lifting a weight or a crayon, you have the power to clear your mind and lift your spirit.</p>
        <h3>Being productive helps you evolve.</h3>
        <p>Being productive teaches you to continuously push yourself. And the more productive you are, the easier it is&nbsp;to evolve into a better self. And because things in motion tend to stay in motion (thanks, Newton!), being productive can easily&nbsp;lead to&nbsp;creating better habits.</p>
        <p>For example, when ten pounds of weights start to feel like ten Pixy Styx, you can upgrade to 20 pounds. Waking up at 6 in the morning can make you more accustomed to waking up at 5.Your schedule itself isn’t important; whether you’re a night owl or a morning bird, you can still be productive.&nbsp;As long as you keep moving forward and improving yourself,&nbsp;growth can take place at any hour.</p>
        <p>Start pushing yourself so much that it feels <em>wrong</em> to stay still.&nbsp;Find a comfort zone in being uncomfortable.</p>
        <h3>Being productive motivates the people around you.</h3>
        <p>When you inspire yourself, you inspire others.</p>
        <p>And when&nbsp;you post motivational quotes, you're (maybe unintentionally) helping other people feel motivated, too. Some may complain that motivational quotes clutter their news feeds. I would say&nbsp;they're influential.&nbsp;Words make contact with people's eyes&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>hearts.</p>
        <p>Doing your own little dance encourages others to make moves. And when people see you improve, it gives them hope that they can do the same.</p>
        <p>Be proud of the work that you do, and know that you pave the way for those who applaud you. Your steps leave footprints for others to&nbsp;follow.</p>
