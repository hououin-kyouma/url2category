        <p>As an entrepreneur, one of the most important things you can do for your success is establish an effective life-business balance.</p>
        <p>When I started my business, I ate, slept and breathed work. From my career as an athlete, I knew the value of hustle and hard work. So, I set my mind to building something successful, and in turn, it became all I thought about, 24/7.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, my health suffered. My relationships became strained. I was anxious and distracted.&nbsp;When I realized I had gained an extra 30 pounds, I knew I needed to do something different.</p>
        <p>You don’t need to figure it out the hard way, like I did. Take these tips into&nbsp;consideration while you set up the structure of your business.</p>
        <p>I have found I am more effective and productive when I take the extra time to follow a regimen of self-care and life-business balance.</p>
        <p>It may take some tweaking for you to find the right prescription, but here are some of the things that are working for me:</p>
        <h3>1. Stay healthy</h3>
        <p>It’s hard to inspire and enroll others when you aren’t healthy. No matter what kinds of sales you’re bringing in, <a href="http://lewishowes.com/podcast/michele-promaulayko/" target="_blank">if you’re not taking care of your body, it’s not a sustainable plan.</a> Put self-care high up on your priority list. Exercise and&nbsp;eat right.</p>
        <h3>2. Meditate</h3>
        <p><a href="http://lewishowes.com/podcast/bill-harris/" target="_blank">Meditation is massive.</a>&nbsp;Since I started practicing this regularly again, my anxiety, focus and productivity have all improved. Plus, it’s helpful when you’re managing a lot.</p>
        <p>Don't worry about doing it the "right" way. There are plenty of methods, so keep trying&nbsp;until&nbsp;you find one you enjoy. It should be restorative; some people just follow their breathing, and others use guided meditation.</p>
        <p>If you have a busy and anxious mind, I recommend starting with a guided track.<strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
        <h3>3. Be clear on your vision</h3>
        <p>Most of the problems people have with getting what they want comes from lack of clarity. Figure that out first,&nbsp;<a href="http://lewishowes.com/podcast/marie-forleo/" target="_blank">then go after it.</a></p>
        <p>Maybe you aren't clear on your vision yet. If this is the case, I recommend writing down what your perfect day would look like:&nbsp;<em>What is it you ultimately want to feel each day? </em></p>
        <p>Remember, you don't have to have perfection to start; just go in the direction of your dreams and take things&nbsp;one step at a time.<strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
        <h3>4. Be discerning</h3>
        <p>Know that some opportunities are just distractions in disguise. There are way too many good things to go after these days.&nbsp;<a href="http://lewishowes.com/podcast/power-of-no-with-james-altucher/" target="_blank">Stay focused on your mission and say no to pretty much everything else.</a></p>
        <h3>5. Stay positive</h3>
        <p>Replace negative self-talk with gratitude. <a href="http://lewishowes.com/podcast/travis-brewer-lifestyle/" target="_blank">This is a huge issue for most of us</a>, but you have the power to free yourself from the cycle of beating yourself up.</p>
        <p>Start practicing gratitude every time you want to criticize yourself. We waste more time worrying&nbsp;and&nbsp;complaining than it would&nbsp;require&nbsp;to just handle our problems.<strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
        <h3>6. Rest and restore</h3>
        <p>No matter how hard you push, you will&nbsp;hit a wall if you don’t take care of your mind and body. So much of what my guests and I talk about on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-school-of-greatness/id596047499" target="_blank">The School of Greatness</a> podcast is how to show up.</p>
        <p>There’s no way around it: If you want to be great, you have to show up, make connections happen and then follow up. This is a huge part of success.</p>
        <p>But, equally important is the opposite: resting up. This includes unplugging from your phone and social media for a weekend.</p>
        <p>Your body and soul need to recharge. Go outside and be in nature. Sleep. Read a book. Take a leisurely stroll with no destination in mind.</p>
        <p>These are the down times you need in order to stay focused when it is "go time" again.</p>
        <h3>7. Fill up your cup</h3>
        <p>Having said that, you absolutely need to make time for fun, family, friends and fulfillment. It is no good being a lone ranger.</p>
        <p>Set your office hours and do your best to adhere to them while taking regular time out to unplug. <a href="http://lewishowes.com/marketing/become-a-leader-online/" target="_blank">Play your guitar that’s gathering dust</a>&nbsp;or pull out the old tennis racket for a match. Take a walk on the beach.</p>
        <p>Just remember, you are a human being, not a human <em>doing</em>. The more balance you have in your business and life, the more successful you will be.</p>
