        <p>When I graduated with my Bachelor's in August, I thought I knew exactly what I wanted out of my career -- the title, the schedule, the whole shebang, really.</p>
        <p>Well, I got a rude awakening (or enlightenment) when my dream internship turned into a nightmare in no time.</p>
        <p>I took a hard look at my <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/life/12-times-discovered-strengths-never-knew/1237490/" target="_parent">strengths</a> and weaknesses, and I was honest with myself about what kind of work life would best suit me.</p>
        <p>Now here I am, four months later, a bonafide 9-to-5er. Who'd have thought? Sometimes, the thing you most strongly oppose is actually the thing you need the most.</p>
        <p>Here are four reasons why I love working my 9-to-5:</p>
        <h3>1. I get plenty of sleep.</h3>
        <p>There's no shame in the bedtime game.</p>
        <p>In fact, I take pride for loving my sleep and I think anyone who says otherwise is lying to themselves.</p>
        <p>I &nbsp;need an absolute minimum of 8 hours shut-eye in order to function at work.</p>

        <p>By working the typical 9-to-5, I'm able to relax in the evening, get a full night of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/tag/sleep" target="_parent">sleep</a> and wake up refreshed the next day. (Unless I go on a Netflix-binge, <em>that's</em> a different story.)</p>
        <p>My day is structured so I can do everything I need to without feeling rushed, distracted or overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>This makes me all the more capable of tackling my workday head-on.</p>
        <h3>2. I make the most of the early hours.</h3>
        <p>As&nbsp;someone who used to wake up mid-afternoon and now wakes up <em>really</em> early, I have news for you: Being a <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/wellness/steps-wake-up-happy-morning/1702461/" target="_parent">morning person</a> pays off.</p>
        <p>Though the college girl in me still insists on being a night owl, I've learned to tame her for the sake of maintaining my sanity.</p>
        <p>Rather than hitting "snooze,"&nbsp;waking up groggy and&nbsp;dragging my feet across the floor like I used to, I now welcome the morning with open arms.</p>

        <p>There's something calming about it.</p>
        <p>I look forward to watching the sun rise, and sipping coffee before getting dressed for work; it allows me to start my day on a positive note which helps me be productive as soon as I get to work.</p>
        <h3>3. I eat on a regular schedule.</h3>
        <p>Despite what I like to tell myself, I can't survive merely on coffee and the souls of my enemies.</p>
        <p>It's common for me to accidentally <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/sports/eating-habits-weight-loss-impossible/1191738/" target="_parent">skip meals</a>, especially when I'm hard at work. But by working a 9-to-5 I habitually make time to eat before I leave, take my lunch break at a standard time and have dinner when I get home.</p>
        <p>It's almost impossible to forget to eat because my workday is synced with my meal times.</p>
        <div class="__mobiledoc-video-card">
         <div id="jwplayer-video-2929"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Oh, and I'm also around to take advantage of office lunches out or meals ordered in, which is always a plus. I'm a woman on a budget,&nbsp;after all, and the grocery struggle is real.</p>
        <p>Aside from the obvious energy boost, eating regularly makes an astronomical difference in my mood.</p>
        <p>There's just no time for being hangry when you're hustlin'.</p>
        <h3>4. I have time for my friends and family.</h3>
        <p>It may be a cookie-cutter lifestyle, but the 9-to-5 workday has some nice <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/life/culture/7-ways-social-life-bound-change-college-graduation/920193/" target="_parent">social</a> perks.</p>
        <p>Most people close to me work the same hours, so keeping in touch with them throughout the week is a total breeze.</p>
        <p>Getting together after work for dinner or drinks frequently happens, and it's a convenient way to wind down and catch up.</p>
