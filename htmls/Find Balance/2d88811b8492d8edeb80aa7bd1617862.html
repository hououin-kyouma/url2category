        <p>Your life revolves around a few main spheres, whether you are aware of them or not, including your relationships, career, health, and hobbies.&nbsp;It is your responsibility to maintain each of these spheres to ensure that you live a balanced, productive, and healthy lifestyle.</p>
        <h3>Relationships</h3>
        <p>Whether it’s with your close friends, girlfriend, boyfriend, family members, or teachers you are in a constant evolution of building and maintaining relationships. If you find it difficult to pinpoint one or more genuine relationships in your life, you should make more of an effort to value the people in your life.</p>
        <p>If you’re somewhat of a loner, cherish your relationships with your family, first and foremost. To build a social circle, take advantage of any networking opportunities like joining clubs, playing a sport, etc.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, if you keep up with your relations, understand what is going on in the lives of those closest to you, and see how you can contribute and make their lives better, your relationships will <i>definitely </i>give you a sense of satisfaction in the world. Having a support system is crucial to one’s happiness.</p>
        <p>Sounds funny, right? Helping others… Well, you have the ability to help others by simply offering them support or genuine friendship. Keep in mind that no relationship is bad. It is what you make it, and ANYBODY is capable of ANYTHING.</p>
        <p>So stop with the continuous attempts to make friends with the “cool” people out there, wherever you are, and begin to focus on bettering yourself and offering your friendship only to the people who make you feel like the best version of yourself.</p>
        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p>Your career is a crucial area in your life because your finances allow you to indulge in the things you enjoy.&nbsp;If your prerogative is to lie around, watch television, and smoke pot all day, then all you need is enough to pay for your rent, your pot, and the cable.</p>
        <p>If you are the more ambitious type and enjoy going on adventures, meeting new people, searching for amazing experiences, reading page-turners, consuming delicious food, and so on, your finances will have to be more organized. To live a comfortable lifestyle, you will have to generate MORE than what you SPEND.</p>
        <p>It is in your best interest to consciously save your money with each paycheck, so when you need funds to fall back on, they’re there. It is shocking how this common sense is lost in people, and many tend to spend their income on irrelevant, unnecessary things.</p>
        <p>In addition to finances, there are relationships in your career, which you must remember to keep professional and up-to-date. There is no room for complainers, faultfinders, and quitters in this world. Accept the responsibility of being the one who takes action and makes decisions in relation to people.</p>
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>Your health is probably one of the most important things on this list, simply because it is intertwined with your emotions and neurotransmitters.&nbsp;Serotonin, Dopamine, GABA, and acetylcholine are all chemicals released through physical and strenuous exercise that reflect in your mood throughout the day.</p>
        <p>This eventually leads to you to being more synergistic in your interactions. Health also provides you with vitality, and with vitality, you have the ability to relate and create new relationships.</p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Your hobbies make you who you are in a way, as you can learn about yourself through your hobbies.&nbsp;Whether you engage in sports, games, or writing, all of these help you to better understand yourself.&nbsp;Think of it as you unraveling yourself into your writing, your sport, or game, etc.</p>
        <p>As a human being, you have an abundance of energy within you. If the pain and unwanted thoughts leave, you will find pure energy. Knowing this, you can apply your energy to all areas of your life.</p>
        <p>These ideas may seem far-fetched, but life is having energy and using the prefrontal cortex to guide you through life to make decisions.</p>
        <p>The more energy you have, the more you will be able to accomplish and do. Keep the energy positive. Life can get rough sometimes, but you must be able to bring about a positive mindset at any given time, through daily practices and keeping up with all of these spheres for a balanced and well-maintained lifestyle.</p>
