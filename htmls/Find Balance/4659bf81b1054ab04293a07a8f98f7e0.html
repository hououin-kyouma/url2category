      <h2>Ways to Improve Your Diet Leading a Healthy Lifestyle</h2> 
      <p>Then, we will explain all the tips to lose weight and why the improvement of lifestyle leads to a healthier diet.</p> 
      <h3>Getting Up Early Is Essential To Activating the Body's Ability to Burn Calories</h3> 
      <img src="http://slism.com/wpsystem/wp-content/uploads/how-to-live-a-healthy-lifestyle-01.gif" width="325" height="360" alt="going to bed early and dieting" style="margin:0 28px 20px 10px; border:1px solid #999; float:right;"> 
      <p>Get up early to wake up with the time that the sun rises is synonymous with a healthy life, there are not so many people who can be performing in the present age. </p> 
      <p>However, trying to go to bed early plays a large role also in a diet.</p> 
      <p><strong>To get up early will be effective to adjust the biological clock that affect the function of the body.</strong></p> 
      <p><strong>A properly adjusting body clock leads to improved calorie consumption and function of the autonomic nervous system that is responsible for the metabolic activity of the body is activated.</strong></p> 
      <p>At the same time, also activated <strong>Diet-Induced Thermogenesis</strong> which is a function of increasing the body temperature by a meal, the calorie consumption is further increased.</p> 
      <p>It is not uncommon for people "but is very hard getting up early, by constitution can not be" called.<br> It is also a way that those who say is hard to rise early perform the diet which cuts down the intake of carbohydrate.</p> 
      <p>The ketone bodies diet performed by the meal which cut down carbohydrate has research that the action which brings a biological clock forward and improves sleep disorder is expectable..</p> 
      <p style="padding:10px; border:1px solid #FFECEC;">Where to give diet cut back on carbohydrates nocturnal mouse, was allowed to proceed for 14 days on a diet of ketone bodies, I found that the body clock of mice was accelerated from 4 hours to 8 hours.<br> <span style="text-align:right;">From: Institute of　Advanced　Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) excerpt</span></p> 
      <h3 style="clear:both;">Increasing Your Walking Speed Helps Burn More Calories</h3> 
      <p>Usually, we are the ones doing the exercise every day even without awareness that "walk".</p> 
      <p>However, ordinary walking as an exercise for the diet is inadequate.</p> 
      <p>When converted to "exercise intensity" as a reference to represent the intensity of exercise to calculate the amount of calories, walk less than 6km per hour is 3 exercise intensity.</p> 
      <p>In the same exercise intensity and bowling, this is calorie consumption is less than 200kcal even walk round the one time some gentle exercise.</p> 
      <p><strong>Movement to that diet for walking, there is a need to "walk fast" to walk normally</strong>.</p> 
      <img src="http://slism.com/wpsystem/wp-content/uploads/how-to-live-a-healthy-lifestyle-02.gif" width="325" height="300" alt="benefit walk fast to walk normally" style="margin:0 28px 20px 10px; border:1px solid #999; float:right;"> 
      <p>Change is carried out in more than 6km walk about an hour early, and exercise intensity already changes from 3 to 5.</p> 
      <p>So 5 / 3 = 1.666 ..., is walking becomes a strenuous exercise with a walk of about 1.67 times the momentum early.</p> 
      <p>In addition, walking also helps train the muscles of the legs early. An increase in the basal metabolic rate that affects calorie consumption by the amount if trained muscles, has a great influence on our diet.</p> 
      <p>Besides, legs first and foremost is a site that receives the burden of weight gain, I must have been firmly disciplined.</p> 
      <h3>Taking House Cleaning To the Next Level into a Respectable Exercise</h3> 
      <p>Daily cleaning is a habit which is indispensable in order to maintain the cleanliness of the room.<br> However, even that would make a virtue of necessity layout "and I thought something to make it easier to take up 'do not care and some people do not want to clean, the room is also littered with much in the world</p> 
      <p>However, as people who do not want to clean the rough nature and portly form, people to clean every day should be a meticulous personality type is the thinnest.</p> 
      <p><strong>Be done carefully patiently cleaned every day, I pulled out the effect diet can lead to increase the effectiveness of the cleaning exercise</strong>.</p> 
      <p>Calorie consumption will increase over time if done carefully, also holds as an exercise for the same three diet walk, exercise intensity of cleaning, but is not a very strenuous exercise.</p> 
      <p>For example movement that is comparable to that reached 238kcal be carried out over an hour mop rack, row 1 hour exercise aero-motor-bike.</p> 
      <p>Calorie consumption can be expected even without the use of a vacuum cleaner if possible, and to be done manually, such as broom, dustpan.</p> 
      <p>And, feeling that if properly cleaned the room once, "Let's not make a mess as possible" to work, I will do so voluntarily, cleaning, tidying up. If so, I'm going to lead to diet with only nature and habit of cleaning as well.</p> 
      <h3 style="clear:both;">Taking Longer Baths Helps You Burn Fat</h3> 
      <p>It seems there are many<u></u>people who say that taking a bath is a pleasant thing, and is just a pain to clean after shower or bath water tension.</p> 
      <p>Some even say that in some cases rarely bathe and shower rather than a bath. I used because it is an attitude ... you must not miss more than appearing in public, I want to put in the habit of bathing every day as much as possible to maintain cleanliness.</p> 
      <p><strong>Is it effective for me that warm the body firmly in the bath will prompt the burning of body fat, diet to promote?</strong></p> 
      <p>Is often thought of "the burning of body fat have to do aerobic exercise," and the burning of body fat is an essential condition is what actually rise in body temperature.</p> 
      <p>Workings of the lipase are a lipolytic enzyme becomes active when the temperature rises. To warm the body in the bath is one of the conditions of a lipase is activated as well as exercise.</p> 
      <p>Taking a bath as many times as gap between the hot water of about 108 Fahrenheit (42 Celsius) and bath "repeat" hot, warm up thoroughly under such a manner that the soaked from the navel to the hot water lukewarm of about 100 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) "to warm firm body, half-body bathing by using the method, such as bathing, "the effect is also prompted by up sweating.</p> 
      <p>Warming the body in a bath and scratching sweat firmly leads to wastes discharge of the skin, and it plays a role also in making lustrous skin. Therefore, getting warm firmly in a bath is a method apt to a woman.</p> 
      <h3>Going To Sleep A Little Early Each Day Helps You Burn More Calories</h3> 
      <p>Even if we are not conscious, we are sitting up late at night frequently in everyday life. <br> Even if it does not exceed 0:00 a.m. over a day, it is natural to have occurred till 10:00 p.m. and 11:00.</p> 
      <p>However, if it is sitting up late at night, it will become craving something to eat with nature, and will eat a between-meal snack and a midnight snack frequent.</p> 
      <p><strong>Sleeping a little early not only prevents a between-meal snack and a midnight snack, but it affects the change in the calorie amount of consumption on the first..</strong></p> 
      <p>A comparison of the calorie consumption of the person and the person to live a life to take a midnight snack in the late riser sitting up late at night, to live eat breakfast properly and go to bed and get up early, people who go to bed and get up early the calories more than 1.5 times compared to those who stay up late There is a study of high consumption.</p> 
      <p style="padding:10px; border:1px solid #FFECEC;">When the meal inductivity heat production (DIT) of the morning type group which has a meal in the morning in - daytime and the evening, and the night type group which has a meal at daytime, an evening, and midnight was compared, in the night type, DIT became low intentionally rather than the morning type.<br> <span style="text-align:right;">From: Japanese Society of Nutrition and Food Science</span></p> 
      <p>If you stay up late to it, has the effect of hormone for appetite called "ghrelin" increases. An increase in ghrelin, the hormone has the effect of suppressing the appetite called "leptin" will continue to decrease.</p> 
      <p><strong>Not only want to eat the supper that was the source of obesity and to sit up late at night, it's also spurred would decrease the amount of calories per day that is</strong>.</p> 
      <h2>Living a Healthier Lifestyle Is the Secret to Keeping a Lasting Diet</h2> 
      <p>There is no way to exert a profound effect easy said although there is a weight-loss method has a number of world, without reducing the meal-like "think of the candidate" diet lose weight have fun "and" lose weight without exercise.</p> 
      <p>It said, or to perform heavy dieting method or seek without diet and exercise on a par with top-notch athlete I do not necessarily infallible.</p> 
      <p>I do not guarantee a rash challenge anywhere there is a thing called a limit to everything, better than the limits that always succeed.</p> 
      <p>In the long-term it cannot be continued, intense diet regime, because I would cause severe rebound as soon as you stop dieting.</p> 
      <p>Than the effect, diet regime should be chosen on the basis of whether it can continue for a long time myself. Long-term continuation of the diet to prevent rebound helps maintain body weight and body type.</p> 
      <p>The improvement in the diet in life, it is also one of the ideal way to continue a long-term diet without difficulty.</p>
