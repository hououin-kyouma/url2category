        <p>Most of us have accepted <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/tag/stress/" target="_parent">stress</a> as a normal part of our daily lives, but it's anything but normal.</p>
        <p>Studies show Americans feel 40 percent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stress.org/stress-is-killing-you/" target="_blank">more stressed</a> than they did just five years ago.</p>

        <p>If you're feeling stressed in your everyday life, taking steps to alleviate stress is the best and easiest way to improve your overall quality of life.</p>
        <p>Here are the 10 most effective ways to reduce stress:</p>
        <h3>1. Hit The Gym</h3>
        <p>One of the best tools for combating stress is already produced by your body.</p>
        <p>Endorphins are your&nbsp;<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-198401020-00004" target="_blank">brain's happy pills</a>,&nbsp;encouraging feelings of well being and euphoria after physical exertion.</p>
        <p>By exercising regularly, not only are you building good habits and working to improve your physical health, but you're also taking steps to reduce your stress, boost your self esteem and improve the quality of your sleep.</p>

         </div>
        </div>
        <h3><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">2. Ditch The Fast Food</strong></h3>
        <p>Everyone knows fast food is bad for you and stress often contributes to stress eating, or emotional eating, which is an easy way to gain weight.</p>
        <p>It's problematic, considering stress can actually make it impossible to lose those stress-eating pounds.</p>
        <p>When you're stressed, your body hordes a <a href="https://smartypantsvitamins.com/the-effects-of-stress-on-eating-habits/" target="_blank">hormone called cortisol</a>, which makes your body hold onto all of the extra fat you've been collecting with your daily fast food lunches.</p>
        <p>By ditching the junk food and focusing on healthy foods,&nbsp;you'll improve your overall health and reduce&nbsp;your stress levels.</p>
        <h3><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">3. Sleep Well</strong></h3>
        <p>When was the last time you had a good night's <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/tag/sleep" target="_parent">sleep</a>?</p>
        <p>We're not talking about the nights you get black-out drunk, or the nights you spend hours counting your ceiling tiles because an anxious mind won't let you drop off to sleep.</p>
        <p>No, when was the last time you had an honest-to-goodness <em>full</em> night of restful sleep?</p>
        <div class="_28eyY">
         <div class="vi5Op">
          <div class="_20cDY" style="padding-top:100%;padding-bottom:157px"></div>
          <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="true">

         </div>
        </div>
        <p>Sleep and stress often find themselves in a vicious cycle; you don't sleep well because you're stressed out, and then you get more stressed because of your lack of sleep.</p>
        <p>Try working on your sleep schedule a little bit at a time.</p>
        <p>Go to bed 10 minutes earlier than normal for a week, then another 10 minutes earlier the next. Skip caffeine before bed and even in the afternoon, and if you really have trouble try taking melatonin.</p>
        <h3><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">4. Know Your Limits</strong></h3>
        <p>We all have that one spot, the proverbial straw that breaks the camel's back, the point where once we pass it we can no longer function.</p>
        <p>If you feel yourself heading toward that back-breaking straw, it's definitely adding to your stress level.</p>
        <p>To reduce your stress, take some time to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/collections/201203/know-your-limits" target="_blank">learn your limits</a>. Once you know what they are, stick to them like super glue.</p>

        </div>
        <h3><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">5. Don't Bottle It Up</strong></h3>
        <p>For women in business, showing any <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/tag/emotions" target="_parent">emotion</a> is a sign of weakness. So, we tend to bottle everything up and hide behind a head-bitch-in-charge façade.</p>
        <div class="_28eyY">
         <div class="vi5Op">
          <div class="_20cDY" style="padding-top:100%;padding-bottom:157px"></div>
          <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="true">
           <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJsdcbtAjxk/"></a>

          <script src="https://platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>
         </div>
        </div>
        <p>Bottling up all of those emotions is bad for you.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2414537/Dont-bottle-emotions--itll-knock-years-life-raise-cancer-risk-70-percent.html" target="_blank">Harvard School of Public Health</a> found bottling up your emotions leads to stress, can cut years off your life and can raise your chance of being diagnosed with cancer.</p>
        <p>Instead of bottling up your emotions, find an outlet for them.</p>
        <p>It doesn't matter what you do, as long as you take the time to vent those emotions in a healthy way.</p>
        <h3><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">6. Try Meditation</strong></h3>
        <p>Meditation, even if you only spend a few minutes&nbsp;<a href="http://emeraldcoastjourneypure.com/9-ways-to-alleviate-anxiety-immediately/" target="_blank">quieting your mind</a> and refocusing on the tasks at hand, can be a great way to reduce your stress levels.</p>
        <p>Once you've gotten the hang of it, it's something you can periodically do throughout the day.</p>
        <div class="__mobiledoc-video-card">
         <div id="jwplayer-video-1599"></div>
        </div>
        <p>People who meditate for a few minutes a day report <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/in-depth/meditation/art-20045858" target="_blank">reduced stress</a> and an overall sense of wellbeing and calmness they carry with them throughout their daily tasks.</p>
        <h3><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">7. Get A Hobby</strong></h3>
        <p>It might sound silly, but getting a hobby you truly enjoy can be a great way to reduce your overall stress levels.</p>
        <p>There have been studies done to determine which hobbies are the best at helping you reduce stress, but they don't appeal to everyone.</p>
        <p>Hobbies like swimming, gardening, photography and cooking are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.therichest.com/expensive-lifestyle/lifestyle/10-hobbies-to-help-reduce-your-stress/" target="_blank">the best for stress relief</a>, but if those don't sound like fun, find something else to keep your hands and mind busy.</p>
        <h3><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">8. Unplug</strong></h3>
        <p>Chances are, you're reading this on your smartphone.</p>
        <p>That little brick of silicon and glass in your hands is one of the most common causes of stress.</p>
        <div class="__mobiledoc-video-card">
         <div id="jwplayer-video-1600"></div>
        </div>
        <p>People are constantly connected to work and social obligations via the electronic leash, making it hard to disconnect and center yourself.</p>
        <p>If you can't shut off the phone and walk away from social media for a week, try <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/unplugging-from-technology/" target="_blank">doing it for a few hours</a>.</p>
        <p>When you finish your work day, shut off your phone and don't think about it until you walk back into the office.</p>
        <h3><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">9. Get Outside</strong></h3>
        <p>Getting outside and enjoying the beauty of nature might sound like a hippy plot, but it's a great way to reduce your stress.</p>
        <p>Studies have proven it&nbsp;helps to <a href="http://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/enhance-your-wellbeing/environment/nature-and-us/how-does-nature-impact-our-wellbeing" target="_blank">improve physical health</a> by reducing tension and can even lower blood pressure.</p>
        <p>You don't have to go primitive camping to get the benefits of nature as a stress reducer. Just taking a walk in the woods (or through your local park) is a great solution.</p>
        <h3><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">10. Practice Mindfulness</strong></h3>
        <p>Mindfulness, or taking the time to be in the moment rather than thinking ahead or behind, is a new practice that's becoming more popular as a means of stress relief.</p>
        <p>By being more aware of your body and your surroundings, you can attach yourself to the present moment.</p>
        <p>It's a branch of meditation often used in conjunction with the practice, but is also a practice all its own.</p>

        <p>In essence, it&nbsp;prevents you from getting stressed because instead of worrying about a mistake you made in the past or something due in the future, you <a href="https://www.verywell.com/mindfulness-the-health-and-stress-relief-benefits-3145189" target="_blank">focus on the present moment</a> – your breathing, heartbeat, how the breeze moves past you, etc.</p>
        <p>In the fast paced, high productivity world we live in, stress will almost always be a part of our daily lives.</p>
        <p>While we can't avoid it, we <em>can</em> change how we let it&nbsp;affect us.</p>

Have you ever wanted to make a change in your life but didn’t quite know how?\n\nThis idea of a \"quarter-life crisis\" seems to be gaining traction with more and more Millennials.\n\nSociety ultimately defined success as a formulaic pathway with a one-size-fits-all mentality, leaving twenty-somethings pushing toward goals and lifestyles they aren’t even sure they want.\n\nBut, what if we redefined that idea of success?\n\nSacha Simmons is one woman working on a new definition.\n\nShe started out as an eager Georgetown graduate working at a major corporation as a consultant and project manager. After working hard, she was promoted and consistently climbed the corporate ladder.\n\nAll seemed to be going to plan, but after a few years, Sacha still felt like there was something lacking in her life. She missed the sunshine and fresh air. She missed having a balanced life.\n\nShe realized a traditional, “successful” path didn’t necessarily mean a happy one.\n\nWith that epiphany, she packed up her MINI Cooper, left DC and headed to Shri Yogi Hari’s Ashram in Florida, where she spent months immersing herself in the study and practice of yoga.\n\nNow, back in her hometown of Los Angeles, she has a new sense of self. She applies the teachings of yoga to her everyday life in order to balance states of happiness and fulfillment.\n\nShe is creating her own definition of success.","tags":["feminist","Millennial","Generation Y","Elite Daily","generation","Aspiration","Gen-Y","Elite","inspiration","WOMEN","Wanderlust","Yoga","Los Angeles","#NoFilter","Florida"]},"_v":0}],["video-card",{"video":{"key":"pNshZTNM","title":"How Your Addiction To Technology Is Holding You Back ","date":1476097202,"duration":42,"description":"You can always judge a person's character by the way they react when they can't find their phone.
