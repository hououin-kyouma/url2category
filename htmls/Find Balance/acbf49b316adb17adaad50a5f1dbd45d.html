What we require is not a balanced diet but a <em>balancing<\/em> diet. We require a diet that balances <em>us,<\/em> not itself.<\/p><p> In the same way, our personal asana practice should not be balanced but should balance us, and our asana classes should balance our students. Since most of our students are in varying states of imbalance, our classes, if rightly conceived, will often appear to be imbalanced to the untrained observer.<\/p><p> Health and yoga are all about finding balance. Effort and rest. Elimination and assimilation. Yang and yin. Day and night. Extreme action leads to death and so does extreme inaction. Finding balance leads to health.<\/p><p> I know many teachers who believe that they have failed as teachers if, at the end of class, their students are not drenched with sweat and exhausted. Yet, our goal should not be to further exhaust our students but to make them whole.<\/p><p> It's a struggle to work against the notions that already exist in our society. We are taught to work hard and ignore the body's pleas for rest, substituting coffee and stimulation for the nap or extra hour of sleep which would otherwise restore us. Because of this, our students usually come to class in varying states of exhaustion. Doing an entire practice of intense movement causes an exhausted nervous system to become thoroughly depleted. Of course, moving a student vigorously is important since most people don't move enough in their daily lives of sitting in chairs all day, achy, and chronically stiff. Yet, we must find a balance in our teaching and make sure the student feels as whole as possible—rather than as exhausted as possible—when he leaves class. In stressful times such as these, perhaps it's time for classes that emphasize restorative poses more.<\/p><p> Teachers are always asking me whether both sides of a pose should be held for an equal length of time. Not only must the practice as a whole be balancing, but each pose must also be balancing. Usually a student is stiffer on one side than another, and staying for an equal length of time on both sides does not balance the student. Instruct the student to say a coupled of extra breaths on the side on which they are stiffer and their body will slowly move back into balance.<\/p><p> Some students can do magnificent backbends but can hardly begin a forward bend. As <a href=\"/for_teachers/\">yoga teachers<\/a>, we easily recognize that this imbalance is unhealthy. Yet, other, less recognizable imbalances can be unhealthy too--imbalances in the student's constitution. Because a student's condition is inherently one-sided, we must help him use asana to balance his condition.<\/p><p> A student whose physical nature is <em>kapha<\/em> (lethargic, sluggish, overweight, loyal, stable, loving) in the Aryuvedic system must generally practice more vigorously to balance his or her <em><a href=\"/health/498\">dosha<\/a><\/em> (condition). The <em>kapha<\/em> nature is like an elephant that doesn't move quickly but can work all day. People with a predominantly <em>kapha<\/em> condition tend to have low blood pressure. For <em>kapha,<\/em> the practice should generally involve more jumping and more movement, and moving through poses without holding them too long. The practice should include backbends, inversions, and arm balances, and de-emphasize long holds in poses except restoratives and Savasana.<\/p><p> A student who is <em>pitta<\/em> (hot, angry, fiery, goal oriented, focused, and a high achiever) is a like cheetah who can run extremely fast but can't sustain the pace for long. Such a person generally needs a more calming practice. Work such students briefly and vigorously to release that pent-up <em>pitta<\/em> energy and then have them hold their poses longer. Encourage a more internal focus and fewer jumps. Do soft backbends, short holds in Sirsasana, and long holds in Sarvangasana. Generally, a <em>pitta<\/em> has high blood pressure, so Sirsasana and backbends are not as beneficial as for the <em>kapha<\/em> person. Forward bends are especially good for <em>pitta<\/em> types. Have such students stay a long time in restoratives and Savasana, preferably with an eye bag and perhaps even blocks around their heads to hold in the fiery energy of the brain.<\/p><p> A student with a <em>vatta<\/em> condition (airy, unfocused, fickle, creative, exuberant, and charismatic) is like a bird, always flying into the sky. Such a student needs a grounding practice to bring them down to earth. Standing poses are ideal. <em>Vatta<\/em> students should hold poses for a long time. Since a <em>vatta<\/em> student loves to jump from pose to pose, work to balance this condition by having a practice with less dynamic movement. Focus on rooting in all poses, especially in standing poses and inversions. Backbends are also good, though <em>vattas<\/em> tend to get dizzy doing them.<\/p><p> Now we approach the question you are probably already asking yourselves. In a class format, how can we simultaneously address different people with different constitutions and conditions? It's not easy. In fact, this magical balancing act is the hallmark of a great teacher. In classes where there are dozens of students, it is, at best, difficult, and, at worst, impossible to teach each individual student according to his condition. Further, all students must hold the poses for the same length of time on each side. However, as you get to know the conditions of the students you can approach them one at a time and teach them how to individualize their practice using the modalities of breath, intention, and method.<\/p><p> In terms of <em>breath,<\/em> a student with a <em>kapha<\/em> condition should be asked to breathe faster while a student with a <em>pitta<\/em> condition should be asked to breathe more slowly. A <em>vata<\/em> student should focus on the exhalations, moving their energy down and rooting into the earth.<\/p><p> The <em>kapha<\/em> student's <em>intention<\/em> should be to focus on lifting the energy of the pelvis upward, creating more fire in the body. The <em>pitta<\/em> student's intention should be to cool down the nervous system, doing poses with a less powerful lift and a greater sense of widening to facilitate the element of water. The <em>vata<\/em> student's intention should be to create downward movement in all poses, a grounding action.<\/p><p> Similarly, the three different conditions can be balanced by three different <em>methods<\/em> of practicing. For example, in standing poses, teach the <em>kapha<\/em> student to lift the energy of the arches up the inner legs and up the central axis. The <em>pitta<\/em> student's method is to expand the heart center into the hands and widen the pelvis. The method for the <em>vata<\/em> student is to plant the heels and the toe mounds into the earth to root.<\/p><p> Through these methods, one student at a time, we can create an appropriate practice using breath, intention, and method, even though everyone in the class appears to be doing the same poses at the same time.<\/p><p> It is a cosmic principle that we either live in imbalance or act to create balance. Though we may be comfortable in imbalance (which we often perceive as balance), we cannot grow in such a state. It is through shining light on that which we are not—our opposite—that we illuminate the road to progress.<\/p><p><strong>Recognized as one of the world's top yoga teachers, Aadil Palkhivala began studying yoga at the age of seven with B.K.S.

             <p>All our lives we hear of the importance of having a "balanced diet." Yet, when viewed through yogic eyes, this popular conception (like most) proves to be, even on its best days, merely a half truth. What we require is not a balanced diet but a <em>balancing</em> diet. We require a diet that balances <em>us,</em> not itself.</p>
             <p> In the same way, our personal asana practice should not be balanced but should balance us, and our asana classes should balance our students. Since most of our students are in varying states of imbalance, our classes, if rightly conceived, will often appear to be imbalanced to the untrained observer.</p>

             <p> Health and yoga are all about finding balance. Effort and rest. Elimination and assimilation. Yang and yin. Day and night. Extreme action leads to death and so does extreme inaction. Finding balance leads to health.</p>
             <p> I know many teachers who believe that they have failed as teachers if, at the end of class, their students are not drenched with sweat and exhausted. Yet, our goal should not be to further exhaust our students but to make them whole.</p>
             <p> It's a struggle to work against the notions that already exist in our society. We are taught to work hard and ignore the body's pleas for rest, substituting coffee and stimulation for the nap or extra hour of sleep which would otherwise restore us. Because of this, our students usually come to class in varying states of exhaustion. Doing an entire practice of intense movement causes an exhausted nervous system to become thoroughly depleted. Of course, moving a student vigorously is important since most people don't move enough in their daily lives of sitting in chairs all day, achy, and chronically stiff. Yet, we must find a balance in our teaching and make sure the student feels as whole as possible—rather than as exhausted as possible—when he leaves class. In stressful times such as these, perhaps it's time for classes that emphasize restorative poses more.</p>

             <p> Teachers are always asking me whether both sides of a pose should be held for an equal length of time. Not only must the practice as a whole be balancing, but each pose must also be balancing. Usually a student is stiffer on one side than another, and staying for an equal length of time on both sides does not balance the student. Instruct the student to say a coupled of extra breaths on the side on which they are stiffer and their body will slowly move back into balance.</p>

             <p> Some students can do magnificent backbends but can hardly begin a forward bend. As <a href="/for_teachers/">yoga teachers</a>, we easily recognize that this imbalance is unhealthy. Yet, other, less recognizable imbalances can be unhealthy too--imbalances in the student's constitution. Because a student's condition is inherently one-sided, we must help him use asana to balance his condition.</p>
             <p> A student whose physical nature is <em>kapha</em> (lethargic, sluggish, overweight, loyal, stable, loving) in the Aryuvedic system must generally practice more vigorously to balance his or her <em><a href="/health/498">dosha</a></em> (condition). The <em>kapha</em> nature is like an elephant that doesn't move quickly but can work all day. People with a predominantly <em>kapha</em> condition tend to have low blood pressure. For <em>kapha,</em> the practice should generally involve more jumping and more movement, and moving through poses without holding them too long. The practice should include backbends, inversions, and arm balances, and de-emphasize long holds in poses except restoratives and Savasana.</p>
             <p> A student who is <em>pitta</em> (hot, angry, fiery, goal oriented, focused, and a high achiever) is a like cheetah who can run extremely fast but can't sustain the pace for long. Such a person generally needs a more calming practice. Work such students briefly and vigorously to release that pent-up <em>pitta</em> energy and then have them hold their poses longer. Encourage a more internal focus and fewer jumps. Do soft backbends, short holds in Sirsasana, and long holds in Sarvangasana. Generally, a <em>pitta</em> has high blood pressure, so Sirsasana and backbends are not as beneficial as for the <em>kapha</em> person. Forward bends are especially good for <em>pitta</em> types. Have such students stay a long time in restoratives and Savasana, preferably with an eye bag and perhaps even blocks around their heads to hold in the fiery energy of the brain.</p>

             <p> A student with a <em>vatta</em> condition (airy, unfocused, fickle, creative, exuberant, and charismatic) is like a bird, always flying into the sky. Such a student needs a grounding practice to bring them down to earth. Standing poses are ideal. <em>Vatta</em> students should hold poses for a long time. Since a <em>vatta</em> student loves to jump from pose to pose, work to balance this condition by having a practice with less dynamic movement. Focus on rooting in all poses, especially in standing poses and inversions. Backbends are also good, though <em>vattas</em> tend to get dizzy doing them.</p>
             <p> Now we approach the question you are probably already asking yourselves. In a class format, how can we simultaneously address different people with different constitutions and conditions? It's not easy. In fact, this magical balancing act is the hallmark of a great teacher. In classes where there are dozens of students, it is, at best, difficult, and, at worst, impossible to teach each individual student according to his condition. Further, all students must hold the poses for the same length of time on each side. However, as you get to know the conditions of the students you can approach them one at a time and teach them how to individualize their practice using the modalities of breath, intention, and method.</p>
             <p> In terms of <em>breath,</em> a student with a <em>kapha</em> condition should be asked to breathe faster while a student with a <em>pitta</em> condition should be asked to breathe more slowly. A <em>vata</em> student should focus on the exhalations, moving their energy down and rooting into the earth.</p>

             <p> The <em>kapha</em> student's <em>intention</em> should be to focus on lifting the energy of the pelvis upward, creating more fire in the body. The <em>pitta</em> student's intention should be to cool down the nervous system, doing poses with a less powerful lift and a greater sense of widening to facilitate the element of water. The <em>vata</em> student's intention should be to create downward movement in all poses, a grounding action.</p>
             <p> Similarly, the three different conditions can be balanced by three different <em>methods</em> of practicing. For example, in standing poses, teach the <em>kapha</em> student to lift the energy of the arches up the inner legs and up the central axis. The <em>pitta</em> student's method is to expand the heart center into the hands and widen the pelvis. The method for the <em>vata</em> student is to plant the heels and the toe mounds into the earth to root.</p>
             <p> Through these methods, one student at a time, we can create an appropriate practice using breath, intention, and method, even though everyone in the class appears to be doing the same poses at the same time.</p>
             <p> It is a cosmic principle that we either live in imbalance or act to create balance. Though we may be comfortable in imbalance (which we often perceive as balance), we cannot grow in such a state. It is through shining light on that which we are not—our opposite—that we illuminate the road to progress.</p>

As our understanding and command of the art of teaching develops, so will the well-being of our students. Deepening that understanding means recognizing that all of our instruction and guidance must rest on a particular foundation: to help our students become \"internally referential.\" <\/p><div tml-image=\"ci020756ac600e2620\" tml-image-caption=\"\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><p> We understand who we are based on our perceptions of the world around us. We learn to compare ourselves with others and value ourselves in accordance with how we stack up with them. Through this process, we become \"externally referential\"we make sense of ourselves by referring to outer standards. By the time we become adults, our self-conceptions are largely borrowed from what we have been told by our parents, family members, friends, teachers, and the commercial media. We do things to look good or be popular, not necessarily because they are our soul's desire or our life's true purpose. Compounding the problem, advertisers incessantly bombard us with messages saying, at root, \"You are falling short when compared to others. You had better buy your way out of this embarrassing situation.\" <\/p><p> Defining ourselves in terms of external references is a dead end because it means ignoring the desires of the soul. As <a href=\"/for_teachers/\">yoga teachers<\/a>, we must work to help our students understand this. In fact, one of our main jobs is to shift the paradigm of external reference to one of internal reference. Our work is to help our studentsparticularly beginnersbecome aware of <em>who<\/em> they are as distinct from what they have been <em>told<\/em> they are. One way to do this is by defying common practice and <em>not telling our students what they are.<\/em> Instead of placing them in categories and destroying their uniqueness with labels, we can tell our students what they can do to change, grow, and find themselves. <\/p><p> Here is an example of this philosophy in action: commonly, teachers tell students, \"You are very stiff, so don't do this pose or you could hurt yourself.\" Instead say to the student, \"I would rather you do this variation of the pose for now.\" In this case, the student does not have a label pinned on him by the teacher and is not bound by the teacher's perception of who he is. The role of the teacher is to know the difference between someone who is stiff and someone who is supple and how to help both students become more balanced. We must find ways to do this without creating or reinforcing a negative, diminishing belief. <\/p><p> As another example, I regularly see students who cannot do certain poses because of illness or stiffness. I say, \"I want you to prepare to do the pose that the others are doing by using the wall, or by using a belt. And after you practice it for a short time, your body will blossom and you will not need the prop anymore.\" I give them a method by which they can remove the stiffness without reinforcing the fact that they are stiff and unable. Most students already feel unable, so confirming it aloud only makes it more of an obstacle. In some cases, they will be condemned to fight the stiffness in both their bodies and minds for the rest of their lives. <\/p><p> The mind will strive to create in the body exactly what it believes to be true. As self-help author Earl Nightingale puts it, \"You become what you think about.\" At age ten, my daughter came back from school one day and said, \"My teacher told me again that I am not good at math. If she keeps telling me that, how will I ever become good at math?\" My daughter apparently feels the power of the mind more clearly than her teacher does. In Milton's immortal words, The mind is its own place, and in itself / Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.\" <\/p><p> Years ago, a student of mine was plagued with chronic pain in her spine that would not go away no matter what I did. She even studied with Iyengar for ten years and could not get any relief. After 25 years of pain, she finally decided to go to a doctor. After a slew of tests, the doctor told her, \"You have lung cancer. It has metastasized to your bones and spread throughout your spine. You have two months to live.\" I tried very hard to convince my student not to submit to the doctor's death sentence. After all, she had had the same pain for more than two decades. Unfortunately, it was too late. She had lost hope by surrendering all her power to the doctor. Two months <em>to the day<\/em> of her diagnosis, she was dead. This example highlights the way that, as teachers, we must use our profound influence wisely and choose every word carefully. Careless words may destroy a life, whereas thoughtful words create the power to blossom. <\/p><p> This approach is not about hiding the truth. We must tell our students the truth that we see. However, we should avoid an inflexible attitude that says, \"This is the truth and I must tell it no matter what the cost!\" We must tell the truth in a way that serves the student by always reminding them of their power to cause positive change. We must balance <em><a href=\"/wisdom/462\">ahimsa<\/a><\/em> with <em>satya:<\/em> nonharming with truthfulness. <\/p><p> The language of transformation is the language of compassion. What transforms our students is not a barrage of fiery words intended to burn down their egos, but the flame of love, warmth, and care. If we have a student who is stubborn and self-important, we can't help her by beating on her ego, for the ego, in defense, builds a hard shell around itself and becomes inaccessible. The way to transform the ego is with compassion and warmth, so the ego removes its outer coat and allows itself to be available for change. <\/p><p> We probably all know teachers who diminish their students because it makes them feel more masterful and aggrandizes their egos. These teachers can be our models of how <em>not<\/em> to teach. As teachers, we can ask ourselves, \"Do I want to appear to be great, or do I want to help my students grow? Do I want to be the star, or do I want to create stars? Do I want to impose my pose on the student, or do I want to help my students go inside and discover their own postures? Am I serving my student or my ego?\" We can't serve both. <\/p><p> The art of guiding others is about knowing how to help them harness the power of their own minds and enabling them to overcome their resistance to transformation. In time, they will become attuned to inner guidance rather than being scattered and misled by external references and comparisons. We can help our students use the power of their minds to destroy or build, stagnate or transform, bury or rise, imprison or set free. Evolution is only possible with freedom.<\/p><p><strong>Recognized as one of the world's top yoga teachers, Aadil Palkhivala began studying yoga at the age of seven with B.K.S.

Though she had been practicing asana intensely and regularly for 12 years with many of the world's most noted teachers, her problem persisted. After asking some questions, I realized that this problem could not be solved by an asana practice. Her diet was to blame. I suggested she stop consuming wheat and dairy products and, within two months, she was cured.<\/p><p> The more comprehensive our approach to teaching, the more we can help our students. In the last decade, I have been developing a more encompassing approach to yoga, similar to the one envisioned by my master, Sri Aurobindo. <em>Purna<\/em> is a Sanskrit word meaning \"complete.\" Purna Yoga is an evolving system using a wide variety of inspiring and effective techniques to address our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs. Purna Yoga is my synthesis of the vastness of yoga into a format designed to help others in their quest to fulfill their dharma or life purpose.<\/p><p> Yoga is as vast as creation, and its wealth continues to expand. As teachers, we must strive to expand what we know, not just in depth, but also in width. To be of most benefit to our students, we must master asana and gain a working knowledge of many related fields. Below is an overview of a course of study for <a href=\"/for_teachers/\">yoga teachers<\/a>.<\/p><p><strong>Asana<\/strong><\/p><p> There are three general types of asana: sustained, flowing, and therapeutic. In sustained asana--as taught by my asana teacher, B.K.S. Iyengar--postures are held for longer periods of time. In the holding, practitioners discover refined movements and alignments and are able to open and channel their inner energy. Flowing asana, taught in a variety of traditions, generates heat, flushes out toxins, and develops external form and strength. The use of the breath to connect the postures requires and cultivates an intense mental focus. Therapeutic asana is designed for individuals, each student receiving a unique practice. The normal rules may not apply--knees may be kept bent, movements may be done slowly, active poses may become passive, and in some cases (such as depression), passive poses may become active. Teachers often use extra props to help support the student.<\/p><p><strong>Pranayama<\/strong><\/p><p><a href=\"/practice/673\">Pranayama<\/a> helps cleanse and strengthen the nervous system. When the nervous system is in our control, we are able to perceive the causes of our physical tensions. Thus asana and <a href=\"/practice/673\">pranayama<\/a> work together. With asana, we learn to control the body and keep it still, and with <a href=\"/practice/673\">pranayama<\/a>, we learn to control the mind and nervous system.<\/p><p> As we practice <a href=\"/practice/673\">pranayama<\/a> and refine our control of the breath, we open up the energetic channels of the body to receiving light and inspiration in our life. In an ideal body, asana is simply a preparation to safely receive the power from <a href=\"/practice/673\">pranayama<\/a>.<\/p><p> When teaching asana, have students use their breath to do the deeper work. This will help them build the connection between breath, nerves, and body, for it is the nerves that always tell the muscles what to do. When teaching actual <a href=\"/practice/673\">pranayama<\/a>, have the student start with Ujjayi <a href=\"/practice/673\">pranayama<\/a>, then Viloma, and then the more subtle and powerful <a href=\"/practice/673\">pranayama<\/a>s.<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> Mudras and Bandhas<\/p><p><em>Mudras<\/em> and <em>bandhas<\/em> are used to create specific flows of energy within the body. Mudras are positions of the hands, the tongue, and the feet. Bandhas are locks, the main locks being those of the pelvic floor <em>(<a href=\"/practice/2417\">Mula Bandha<\/a>),<\/em> the chin <em>(Jalandhara Bandha),<\/em> and the abdomen <em>(Uddiyana Bandha).<\/em> For both protection and heightened efficacy, the yoga student must be taught which bandha to engage during the performance of asana and <a href=\"/practice/673\">pranayama<\/a>. For example, in <a href=\"/poses/492\">Tadasana<\/a> (Mountain Pose), Sirsasana (<a href=\"/poses/481/\">Headstand<\/a>), Setu Bandha Sarvangasana (Bridge Pose), and Viparita Dandasana, Mula Bandha is highly recommended after the student has mastered the basic alignment of the posture. Because the bandhas can cause severe nervous disorders if engaged without precise alignment in the posture, we should teach them to each student individually.<\/p><p><strong><a href=\"/health/ayurveda/\">Ayurveda<\/a><\/strong><\/p><p> Ayurveda means the \"science of life.\" As yoga teachers, we should be aware of the basics of this ancient science, especially the three <em><a href=\"/health/498\">dosha<\/a>s<\/em> (humors) and how they pertain to our students' constitutions. Generally speaking, a person whose constitution is <em>vata<\/em> (airy, light, creative) should be given more grounding poses, such as standing poses. A student who is extremely <em>pitta<\/em> (hot, filled with fire) should not be given an extremely dynamic practice but one that is more cooling, featuring shoulder stands and front bends. A person who is <em>kapha<\/em> (solid, heavy, grounded) needs more dynamic poses, such as jumpings and backbends. Since not everyone is of one <a href=\"/health/498\">dosha<\/a>, since <a href=\"/health/498\">dosha<\/a>s change over the lifetime of a student, and since different systems of the body (such as muscular-skeletal, nervous, and organic) may have different <a href=\"/health/498\">dosha<\/a>s, we must study this science carefully.<\/p><p><strong>Nutrition <\/strong><\/p><p> Even though some asana gurus have long spurned the necessity of integrating nutrition with yoga, I have found that nutrition is as important to the health and development of a student as asana. Though far too vast a subject to discuss in this article, three general principles apply. One is to stay away from poisons, including artificial chemicals, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, and refined sugar. Another is to avoid foods that create imbalance in our organic system. If a student has excessive vata, grounding foods are recommended, such as root vegetables and squashes. For kapha, pitta food is advised, such as foods containing garlic, ginger, onion, and chilies. If the student has excessive pitta, then the fire has to be doused with cooling foods such as raw vegetables and organic yogurt. A third principle is to move toward whole foodfood that is natural, as close to its virgin state as possible. There is no \"perfect\" diet, only the ideal food for an individual. Each person has to customize his diet based on temperament, individual constitution and condition, time of year, life circumstances, and genetic makeup.<\/p><p><strong>Vastu <\/strong><\/p><p> Vastu is the grandfather of <em>feng shui,<\/em> guiding the ways that energy flows through our environment and, hence, ourselves. Studying its basics enables us to help our students align themselves with their outer lives. If a student has difficulty sleeping, we may suggest that she sleep with her head facing a different cardinal point. Such understanding should structure our <a href=\"/practice/\">yoga practice<\/a> as well. For example, <a href=\"/practice/2746\">sun salutations<\/a> should ideally be done between sunrise and noon, performed facing east. While doing <a href=\"/practice/673\">pranayama<\/a>, it is appropriate to face either east or north.<\/p><p><strong>Living Yoga (Yogic Philosophy Applied to Daily Life)<\/strong><\/p><p> From the ages gone by, yoga has developed a profound philosophy that we should apply in day-to-day life. <a href=\"/wisdom/2208\">Patanjali<\/a> explained this in the <em>ashtanga,<\/em> or eight-limbed path. This path includes the <em><a href=\"/for_teachers/984\">yamas<\/a><\/em> and <em>niyamas,<\/em> precepts that are the foundations of day-to-day living in a harmonious society. To live yoga means understanding the importance of finding our dharma, or life purpose.<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> It applies to the creation and distribution of wealth. It means becoming aware of the flows of energy between people, particularly in our relationships with our spouses, friends, children, and parents. \"Living yoga\" clarifies our relationship to material objects and to our own spirit.<\/p><p><strong>Yoga and Sound (Chanting and Mantra)<\/strong><\/p><p> Just as sound is a grosser vibration of light, the body is a grosser vibration of sound. Sound affects us profoundly. We must teach our students by example to use only words that inform, empower, and connect us with our light.<\/p><p> The next level is to chant sacred words, such as <em>Om<\/em> or the <em>Gayatri Mantra.<\/em> These sounds, when taught and practiced correctly, vibrate through the body and align the nervous system with the mantra. Certain mantras cool and soften the nervous system, while others awaken it. In general, awakening mantras such as the <em>Gayatri<\/em> should be done prior to a practice, and soothing mantras (such as the repeated <em>Om<\/em>) should be done after a practice. However, <em>Om<\/em> is neutral and can be done at any time of the day or night.<\/p><p><strong>Transformative Spirituality (<a href=\"/practice/meditation/\">Meditation<\/a>)<\/strong><\/p><p> Teaching students to be still and to quiet the mind and emotions is the first step toward meditation. Meditation is the process by which we connect with the heart center (the psychic being) and receive guidance from within.<\/p><p> My wife Mirra teaches Transformative Spirituality, taking this process to another level. We learn how to move the mental energy down into the heart chakra and the emotional/pelvic energy up into the heart chakra. We learn to live as much as possible from the dictates of the heart chakra, our connection with our soul.<\/p><p> Purna Yoga strives to encompass the vastness of yoga as envisioned by Sri Aurobindo. In his Integral Yoga, he synthesized <em>gnyana,<\/em><em>bhakti,<\/em> and <em><a href=\"/wisdom/1492/\">karma yoga<\/a>,<\/em> developing a whole new system of yoga. As you expand your horizons learning Purna Yoga, may your teaching, your practice, and your life become more and more fulfilling.<\/p><p><strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> Recognized as one of the world's top yoga teachers, Aadil Palkhivala began studying yoga at the age of seven with B.K.S.

It’s an apt tagline for someone who credits his birth to the practice. (Palkhivala’s mother struggled to get pregnant. But after she and Palkhivala’s father started practicing yoga with <a href=\"http://bksiyengar.com/\">B.K.S. Iyengar<\/a>, voilà, a son was born!) Palkhivala, a lifelong student of yoga, created a holistic healing system with his wife, Savitri, called <a href=\"http://purnayoga.com/purna-yoga/\">Purna Yoga<em>™<\/em><\/a>. The Sanskrit term <em>purna<\/em> means “complete,” and Purna Yoga aims to provide students with tools and practices for living full, complete lives, such as alignment-based <a href=\"/poses\">asana<\/a>, Heartfull™ Meditation, applied philosophy, and nutrition and healthful lifestyle wisdom. On the following pages, Palkhivala shares his incredible story and an exclusive asana sequence to get you started on the Purna path—the focus of his online Master Class workshop with Yoga Journal, which launches this month.<\/p><p>My first experience with yoga was in my mother’s womb. For seven years she had been unable to conceive, then she found yoga. She and my father studied in India, directly with B.K.S. Iyengar. Thanks to yoga, I was born. When I was very young, I would watch them take class. Iyengar wouldn’t allow children to participate until they reached age seven. At that age, the mind connects with the body, he said. <\/p><p><em>See also<\/em> <a href=\"/videos/iyengar-101-didnt-know-myths-debunked\">Iyengar Yoga 101: What You Didn't Know + Myths Debunked<\/a><\/p><p>While my memory of my first class (back in 1966) is a blur, I have a lifetime of memories with Iyengar. He was a great taskmaster. As the most famous yoga teacher in the world, he had no one to answer to but himself. I was his youngest student ever, and he wanted to be sure I would be an excellent practitioner. I became one of his star students and protégés. He pushed me very hard, which was both good and bad. Good because it taught me immense discipline, and bad because I incurred many injuries. At seven, when I first started practicing, he would sit on my back for 10 minutes in <a href=\"/poses/seated-forward-bend\">Paschimottanasana<\/a> (Seated Forward Bend) while I cried because it was so painful. But in India, you don’t say “no” to your teacher; there is a great respect for them, so I bore all the pain. The benefit of enduring pain was developing strength of character—today, I can handle difficult life situations with aplomb. <\/p><p>I stuck with the practice. When I was about 15 years old, school officials asked me to teach yoga to my peers. In keeping with tradition, the student must respectfully ask permission from his teacher. So, I asked Guruji (at that time we called him Iyengar Uncle), “May I teach?” He said with a smile, “Yes, go teach.” When I started, I realized that if I was going to teach yoga, I had to be serious about mastering it in my own body.&nbsp;<\/p><p>My practice intensified. In 1975, the Iyengar students of Bombay, where we lived, helped build Guruji’s famous institute in the nearby city of Pune. He invited me to spend time with him there. Sometimes we practiced eight hours a day: from 7:00 a.m. to noon, plus two more hours in the afternoon. The later practice was comprised of only two poses: <a href=\"/poses/supported-headstand\">Salamba Sirsasana<\/a> (Supported Headstand) and <a href=\"/poses/supported-shoulderstand\">Salamba Sarvangasana<\/a> (Supported Shoulderstand). We’d hold Sirsasana for 45 minutes and Sarvangasana for an hour and a half, with variations. It was very intense so it was usually only Guruji and me, alone, face to face. Through my practice I developed the tenacity to hold on, to develop a nervous system with a buffer.<\/p><p><em>See also<\/em> <a href=\"/lifestyle/5-life-lessons-yoga-master-b-k-s-iyengar\">5 Life Lessons from B.K.S Iyengar<\/a><\/p><p>I continued working with Iyengar for more than 30 years. I chaired committees in the <a href=\"https://www.iynaus.org/\">Iyengar Yoga National Association of the United States<\/a>, but the politics were not appealing to me, so I stepped down and began to focus on other aspects of yoga. My family had been introduced to the Indian poet, yogi, philosopher, and spiritual giant Sri Aurobindo when I was about 10 years old. Later in life, my studies with Savitri (a meditation master in her own right) and my research on naturopathic healing and lifestyle changes led me to deeply embrace the yoga of Sri Aurobindo. Due to illnesses in my family, I also began studying nutrition, which was not a part of the Iyengar system. Eventually Savitri and I developed Purna Yoga, which strives to encompass the vastness of Sri Aurobindo’s vision.<\/p><p>There are many unique things about Purna Yoga. I developed <a href=\"/practice\">asana practices<\/a> based on what our bodies need—specifically for hips, lower back, shoulders, and upper back—with <a href=\"/practice/yoga-sequences\">sequences<\/a> for treating specific conditions. A student can do a single sequence or link them together to create a complete class. The asana are both diagnostic tools and remedies for physical and mental problems. Purna Yoga also uses ancient sequences, like classical <a href=\"/yoga-101/shine\">Surya Namaskar<\/a> (Sun Salutation), but adds an alignment focus for safety. Because I had injured myself so many times in <a href=\"/yoga-101/types-of-yoga/iyengar\">Iyengar Yoga<\/a>, I set out to make the safest yoga practice possible. This doesn’t mean that no one ever gets injuries in Purna Yoga; rather there is careful emphasis on physiology and how the body works. Purna Yoga is really deep and careful work. That’s why we have 200-, 500-, 2000-, and 4000-hour teacher trainings. <\/p><p><em>See also<\/em> <a href=\"/lifestyle/remembering-bks-iyengar-aadil-palkhivala\">Remembering B.K.S. Iyengar: Aadil Palkhivala<\/a><\/p><p>Another unique aspect<strong> <\/strong>of this practice is the use of Heartfull <a href=\"/meditation\">Meditation<\/a>, which was gifted to Savitri from great yoga and meditation masters. Savitri is a living master of meditation, and her techniques teach students how to bring light and love into their bodies and their lives. Purna Yoga also includes extensive education in ancient and modern nutrition and lifestyle. We are teaching students how to make lifestyle choices in order to be healthy. All things in life matter, not just practicing stretches on the mat. Your life off the mat is much more important. The asana have a purpose—they open up our bodies, making us strong and vibrant and prepared to receive life. But yoga is about how we use that strength and vitality. It is about how kind we are, how much we care about others, and how respectful we are to planet Earth. It is about living in integrity with your dharma.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Sri Aurobindo said,<strong> <\/strong>“All life is yoga.” That means yoga is about the thoughts you think, the words you speak, and the actions you take. It is about the person you are becoming each moment. This is the power of Purna Yoga. We use it all the time: in our <a href=\"/lifestyle/balance/relationships\">relationships<\/a> with others, in the way we interact with the world. It is our life experiences that count; the shape of our bodies is superficial. Unfortunately yoga has become very egocentric. Yoga is not about fitness. Our bodies are going to die, but our spirits, which we take with us from life to life, will live on forever. <\/p><p>I want people to focus on now. If we take care of the moment with integrity, the future will take care of itself. It’s high time yoga moved toward a holistic system of living and away from egotistic asana practices. Our spirit must flow in our lives, not our egos. Observe yourself throughout the day to determine if you are living in your highest integrity and highest ideals. Ask yourself, “Am I educating myself every day so my ideals grow?” We need to realize we are not here to play around. Yes, we must enjoy life, but we must also evolve and be of a kind, loving nature. I’m not talking about a woo-woo kind of love.&nbsp;<\/p><p>I’m talking about actually being of value to others and the planet. Purna Yoga is very real. It scares away some because it demands self-observation and change, but those who want more out of life love this magnificent system.&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Try his practice now:&nbsp;<\/strong><a href=\"https://www.yogajournal.com/practice/the-yoga-of-integrity-a-mind-body-balancing-sequence\">The Yoga of Integrity: A Mind + Body Balancing Sequence<\/a><\/p><p><strong>Learn More<\/strong>&nbsp;<br tml-linebreak=\"true\">Yoga Journal’s new online Master Class program brings the wisdom of Aadil Palkhivala and other world-renowned teachers to your fingertips, offering exclusive access to six-week workshops with nine different master teachers, plus opportunities for Q&amp;A.

An agitated nervous system fails to receive the spirit's guidance, just as a warped antenna cannot receive television signals properly. That is why, in yoga and in life, we must protect the nervous system and ensure that it lives in a state of equanimity. Similarly, we must create an experience for our students that sooths, rather than irritates, their nerves. <\/p><div tml-image=\"ci020756ac60142620\" tml-image-caption=\"\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><p> The nervous system is a transmitter as well as receiver. It is an electrical system emitting powerful electro-magnetic waves and transmitting impulses that connect and harmonize all aspects of our being. The nervous system feels joy and sorrow and initiates laughter and tears. However, when agitated, it fumbles through its job, and so do we. <\/p><p> In our society, we are always being hurried along, running from one task to another like frustrated rats on an eternal treadmill. Our poor nerves rarely get a chance to rest or breathe. Yoga classes should be an antidote to this feverish fervor. They should give our students time to pause, feel, and tune in. Let us not reduce our classes to one more hectic episode in a student's day or one more unrelenting blur of intense activity. <\/p><p> When I first taught in America in 1980, I was astonished to see that many students would shut their eyes while doing asanas in an effort to relax. Yet, they would lie down in <a href=\"/poses/482\">Savasana<\/a> with their eyes wide open. When it was actually time to tune in to the trauma and tension in their nervous systems, they were afraid to face the demons within and could not let go. This highlights the challenge facing us as <a href=\"/for_teachers/\">yoga teachers<\/a>. <\/p><p> Doing is the state of moving toward something, of looking into the future. In contrast, feeling is the state of being in the moment. Peace comes from being completely present and feeling what is going in the now. But how do you create peace as a teacher? <\/p><p> During class, frequently remind your students to pause and <em>feel<\/em> what they are doing, and then use their breath to initiate their next move. When I get lost in a city and pull out a map, I first need to know where I am on that map to know how to proceed. In the same way, the student, to feel at peace in a pose, first needs to know where they are in their body. Ask your students to feel the weight in their heels or the pressure on their fingertips, and automatically their mind will go into a reflective state to observe what is going on inside. And any attempt to feel what is going on inside the body creates a mind-body connection, calming the nervous system, and fostering peace. <\/p><p> As your students pause after each pose, encourage them to bring awareness into their bodies and create equanimity in their minds before proceeding. Shutting the eyes creates calmness because the body responds by moving the nervous system from its active, sympathetic state to its quiet, parasympathetic state. Opening the eyes reverses that. Often during class, I will ask students to come out of a pose with their eyes open, sit up, close their eyes, tune in, and then open their eyes before moving on. <\/p><p> The nervous system is the subtlest part of our physical body. Therefore, the breath, which is also subtle, affects the nervous system most profoundly. It's like two tuning forks of the same frequencywhen you strike one, the other immediately starts vibrating. <\/p><p> Encourage your students to always be conscious of their breathing, and work with their breath, especially when working at their edge. Slow, deep breathing is the nervous system's best friend. The breath is directly connected to the heartbeat and, as we breathe faster, the oscillations in the nervous system increase in intensity. Teaching students to slow down their breathing will slow down their heartbeat and calm their nerves. On the other hand, when they hold their breath, they build tension in the nervous system, which can increase blood pressure dramatically. <\/p><p> However, as teachers, we must be very careful with certain <em>Pranayama<\/em> practices. <em>Bhastrika <a href=\"/practice/673\">pranayama<\/a><\/em> (often known as \"Breath of Fire\") can damage or even destroy the nervous system. I'll never forget a woman who came to me for legal advice when I was practicing law. She was extremely agitated, constantly distracted, and couldn't finish a thought or a sentence. I learned that her nervous system was burnt out from years of practicing <em><a href=\"/practice/673\">pranayama<\/a><\/em> improperly, specifically <em>bhastrika<\/em> and <em><a href=\"/poses/2452/\">kapalabhati<\/a><\/em> (Skull-shining breath). When an excess of pranic energy floods the nervous system, it is like a balloon that's filled with more air than it has the strength to contain. The nervous system is shattered and severe mental trauma can result. The body must be properly prepared with years of asana (especially backbends) to safely receive and contain the power of <em>prana.<\/em><\/p><p> And there are other ways to harm our students with the practice. For instance, the nervous system is agitated by jerky movements. This includes trembling during a pose by working too hard. Remind your students that there is no virtue in holding poses too long, for the benefits quickly unravel and turn into detriments. I have heard some teachers say to their students, \"Shake it out!\" and encourage their students to shake themselves after intense poses to release tension. This misses the point. It is far better to be still and melt the tension with awareness. <\/p><p> There are a number of specific techniques I recommend for bringing peace to students who are particularly scattered. Have your students do suspended inversions such as hanging on a pelvic swing or <a href=\"/poses/491\">Adho Mukha Svanasana<\/a> with a wall rope around their thighs. In these poses, the spine can release and the nerves in the spine can relax. This creates a sense of calmness as the body moves into its parasympathetic mode. Another way to create this effect is to have your students do Savasana with a head wrap. This contains the scattered waves of the brain so that, when the student removes the wrap, the brain waves are more coherent, focused, and calm. <\/p><p> Encourage your students to strive to maintain equanimity in every pose. However, for cultivating peace, balance is more important than the mere display of equanimity. If your students have been sitting in chairs all day, it is necessary to swing the pendulum the other way and work them vigorously to release pent-up tension. The art in this case is to work vigorously, yet not violently; intensely, yet with equanimity. <\/p><p> We feel peaceful only when we feel safe--when we don't have fear. Our sympathetic nervous system kicks in as soon as there is fear, in the \"fight or flight\" response. Hence, it is our duty as teachers to make sure our students feel safe in class. When our students feel safe, their parasympathetic system activates and begins self-exploration and healing. Self-exploration is impossible for one who lives in fear. Fearful people are more concerned with defense and with countering the aggressive force of an \"enemy.\" When a student appears to be fearful, ask yourself, \"What have I done to make this student feel unsafe? Is the student reflecting my doubt or fear, my lack of knowledge or experience?\" Do not let an egoistic desire to appear competent create fear in your students or destroy their peacefulness. <\/p><p> Living in a consumer society, we may fear that unless we accumulate a lot of things, we will be labeled as failures. When we desire and are not able to possess, a discord arises within us and propels us into a restless state of frustration and strife. It is only a sense of contentment that can move our nervous system into a state of peace. The ideal is to have the means to acquire whatever we desire and yet be content with not having it. Then we can be calm. In other words, peace seldom comes from austere self-denial. Rather, it comes from having the ability to possess anything we want, yet consciously making the choice to have less in order to keep our lives simple and calm. <\/p><p> While external peace is the result of freedom and choice and lack of fear, internal peace is independent of external phenomenon. No matter what is happening outside, when I tap into my inner spirit, I am at peace. I enter that unruffled quality of <em>chitti<\/em> (pure consciousness, or God). When we connect with this <em>chitti,<\/em> then no matter whether we are driving on a freeway, meditating in a mountain meadow, or standing in front of a speeding bullet, we feel an expansive peace, like the feeling of stepping into a hushed cathedral or of melting into the colors of a sinking sun. <\/p><p> When we take the time to be peaceful and calm, we are given more time in return. Calmness grants us focus, and with this we accomplish more while expending less. Indeed, great focus comes from great calmness and not from great fervor. When calmness and peace is ours, we are receptive to our soul. We allow ourselves the imminence of bliss. This bliss is one of the greatest gifts we can share with our students. <\/p><p><strong>Recognized as one of the world's top yoga teachers, Aadil Palkhivala began studying yoga at the age of seven with B.K.S.

She was in her 30s, married, well established in her profession, and a sincere student of the dharma. She looked up after a few moments of reflection, smiled nervously, and said, \"I guess you wonder why I'm here. I know you don't normally do these kinds of meetings with students, but I don't need an interview about my practice; I need a perspective on my personal life.\" I had recently worked intensely with this woman at a retreat, where she had told me she was in therapy and that it had been helpful in her life and practice. She was confident and very self-reliant, so I knew she would not casually ask for an appointment. \"So let's hear it,\" I replied.<\/p><p> \"I'm confused and contracted around my marriage,\" she began to explain. \"It's not that there's anything really wrong; it's just that I don't have some feeling I thought I would have. The more successful and satisfying the other parts of my life are, the less vibrant the relationship feels. He's a good guy, and we're nice to each other. I'm not interested in some other man; it's just...well, that's why I'm here. I don't know what it is.\"<\/p><p><em>See also<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/3-poses-help-love-body/\">3 Poses To Help You Love Your Body<\/a><\/p><p> The woman frowned and continued, \"Then, in my <a href=\"/category/meditation/\">meditation<\/a> practice, I see my endlessly wanting mind and the pointlessness of chasing after some happiness that he is supposed to provide. I know that my happiness can only be found within, but still there is this...disappointment. Just last night, as we walked down the street after having dinner with friends, it felt like I should be going to my home and he to his. We were just friends--it wasn't romance. It's not that I have to have romance; it is just that I thought...This is all just ridiculous!\" She finished in a rush, her face now totally flushed. \"What do I do with these feelings? What does the dharma tell me to do?\"<\/p><p> I felt great empathy for her confusion. I've made plenty of mistakes in relationships, including being confused between the idealism of my practice and the realities of my emotional needs. But she was doing something wonderful with her confusion--she was using its energy to broaden her inquiry about herself and love. Supported by all the psychological work she had done, her integrity, and her mindfulness practice, she was opening herself to exploring the greater truth that underlies our craving for a romantic relationship.<\/p><p> Whether you are a man or a woman, you may have a question similar to hers. You may be looking for clarity about making a commitment. You may be wondering if you should leave a marriage, or how to improve the one you have, or you may feel that the time for being with someone has passed you by. In each of these situations, it is appropriate to ask yourself how your ideas of romance mesh with your spiritual values and aspirations. Unfortunately, it is easy to become confused in thinking about relationships in the context of your dharma practice and, consequently, to undermine both.<\/p><p> So I hesitated as I sat there wondering how to answer the woman's question. Certainly, her dharma practice could help her see her relationship more clearly, and it could help her more skillfully implement whatever she decided to do, but was she sufficiently mature to consider consciously making her relationship part of her dharma practice? It is tempting to hear about a profound way of working with romantic love and think, \"This will solve all my problems!\" But that's only theoretical. To actually practice mindfulness in a relationship, you have to find the strength of heart and mind to persist through much difficulty and doubt in order to make it real in your life.<\/p><p><em>See also<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/practice-section/the-power-of-love-meditation/\"> The Power Of Love Meditation<\/a><\/p><p> I first encountered the possibility of integrating outer love and inner practice in a teaching by Ram Dass. A student had asked him a question about relationship. At first, Ram Dass gave a superficial answer, but when the student persisted, he said, \"Well, if you really want to look at love from the spiritual side, you can make your relationship your yoga, but it is the hardest yoga you will ever do.\"<\/p><p> Even though I was only in my early 20s at the time, I already had a vibrant practice that was filtering into my daily life, so I immediately understood the implication of making relationship my yoga. And I wanted nothing to do with it! It did not fit my idealized notion of romance--unconditional love that involved much drama around truth telling and intense feelings in and out of bed as each of us sorted out our childhood wounds and searched for life's meaning. I could not imagine surrendering passion to the purifying fire of practice. But Ram Dass was speaking of a way of being in a relationship that is more fulfilling than living with intense expectations of each other. How could this be?<\/p><p> Only with repeated experience in long-term relationships and years of meditation practice did I begin to see the delusion that was inherent in my romantic expectations and the suffering that it involved. Expectations are a form of view, and the Buddha taught that view is a fetter to freedom. The truth of this is clearly visible in relationships.<\/p><h3>Culturally Conditioned Love<\/h3><p> Our current expectations about love are based on our culture's concept of romance, which originated in England and other parts of Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries with the emergence of the courtly love associated with knights and their ladies. It was not that romantic love was suddenly invented or discovered then; rather, it evolved into an idealized form that redefined how we perceive love and how we act it out.<\/p><p><em>See also<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/uncategorized/5-things-yoga-taught-love/\">5 Things Yoga Taught Me About Love<\/a><\/p><p> According to Jungian analyst Robert Johnson, author of We: Understanding the Psychology of Romantic Love, romantic love humanized the love of the Holy Spirit, which previously had been expressed only with religious symbols, by projecting onto a woman the image of spiritual perfection. Said another way, romantic love became the idealization of the feelings that a man was capable of having about a woman, feelings that were superior to carnal lust or economic practicality. Over time, the belief came into being that these pure feelings of love were transfiguring to both sexes and that love was a means of spiritual growth. This new notion of romance combined selfless, spiritual love (known as <em>agape<\/em> in Greek) with earthly, lustful love <em>(eros)<\/em> and a third kind of love, friendship <em>(filia)<\/em>.<\/p><p> The idea that the feelings of caring between two people have spiritual meaning was revolutionary. Originally, there was no sexual acting out. The woman who stood for spiritual perfection was often married to someone else; thus, romantic love was an internalized experience of ecstasy of the spirit, not of sexual pleasure. However, as this idea of romantic love spread, it increasingly became a factor in choosing a mate. Historically, marriages were arranged by parents to serve economic and social ends. But by the 20th century, most people believed that this feeling of romantic love, not arranged marriage, was the basis for making a lifelong commitment.<\/p><p> As the original ideas of courtly love became widespread, they became more and more diluted with ordinary wants, although traces are still there as we search for a \"soul mate,\" fall in love at first sight, and read through the poems of Pablo Neruda. Love is often regarded as the peak individual experience, but without the sense that it is grounded in Spirit (despite our culture's tradition of church weddings). Absent a strong connection to the idea of love being its own reward, it is hard for a relationship to seem like it's \"enough.\" The expectations are simply too large.<\/p><p> For many people, a relationship is considered successful only if all of their sexual and emotional needs are fulfilled, and their economic and social-status aspirations are met. Obviously, things often don't work out in this manner, and there is a feeling of disappointment in the relationship. Many couples address this problem by having children and connecting through them to selfless love. In fact, parenting is the most idealized spiritual act in our culture. But in many instances, the feeling of spiritual connection through the child does not spread to the relationship or to the inner life. When the children are no longer the primary focus, what remains is an arid distance between two people.<\/p><p><em>See also<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/uncategorized/5-things-kids-have-taught-me-about-yoga/\">5 Things Kids Have Taught Me About Yoga<\/a><\/p><h3>Hollywood Romance<\/h3><p> Hollywood's happily-ever-after romantic comedies carry the implicit message that if your relationship isn't ideal in all ways, then it is second-rate. Nothing could be more wrong, and many romantic movies make no reference to the connection between human love and spiritual love. Pretty Woman, one of the most popular relationship movies of the past 25 years, is both a Cinderella story, in that the woman escapes the misery of her external life and is blissfully worshiped, and a Beauty and the Beast story, in which the man is redeemed from his frozen feelings by a woman who is without guile though still very sexy.<\/p><p> Pretty Woman was popular with both men and women from all backgrounds; however, neither of the main characters in the film does any of the hard work that would generate the strength or generosity to actually be a liberating partner for the other. In fact, their behavior as prostitute and capitalist predator reinforce just the opposite traits. Unlike the fairy tales they reflect—in which the characters are redeemed partly by their honest suffering and open hearts—everything happens spontaneously to this man and woman merely by \"magic.\" Pretty Woman's appeal reflects our culture's great hunger for redeeming love in a relationship, but its superficiality actually reinforces the grasping for an end- all, be-all relationship while ignoring the necessity of taking those tough steps that make it possible. Likewise, When Harry Met Sally, which illustrates the addition of best friend to the love equation, and Sleepless in Seattle, in which neither the male nor female lead has found a place of center within him- or herself, convey the message that deep connection can be made from the surface of life. I frequently meet men and women who have such unrealistic expectations about relationships that they are made miserable by comparing their situation with how they think love is supposed to be.<\/p><h3>Loving Insights<\/h3><p> The woman sitting in my office embodied this dilemma of expectations. For three years, she had been asking herself if she should stay in her marriage and make it work or go look for love with someone else. She felt that nothing had changed in that time and that she finally needed to do something, because she wanted children and believed that the older she got, the fewer \"good men\" there would be to partner with. I could not tell her what to do, but I <em>could<\/em> show her how to apply mindfulness to her problems, talk with her about the differences between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship, and share what I had learned about the different options for using relationship as dharma practice.<\/p><p><em>See also<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/yoga-101/importance-identifying-shraddha-dharma/\">Find Your Purpose Using Dharma + Shraddha<\/a><\/p><p> Even if you do not choose to make relationship your spiritual practice, the insights of mindfulness can help you clarify all the expectations and interpretations that determine how much you suffer with romantic love. As you learn the dharma, it becomes obvious that much of the misery you experience in relationships is not caused by the situation itself, or \"what is,\" but by your mind's reaction to it. You quickly discover that you are tormented by what the Buddha described as \"wanting mind.\" Wanting mind leaves you dissatisfied with your relationship and your life because it defines life by what it does not have; therefore, there is never an end to the wanting. Or else you experience aversion to certain characteristics of your significant other, yourself, or your life together. You then compare these irritations or frustrations with an imagined perfect alternative and you suffer. These judgments about your life being insufficient build steadily until they form the reality of your perception. You then become restless and worried, or lifeless and numb, in the relationship.<\/p><p> This is not to say that the problems in your relationship are not real, nor is it to say that they are not sufficient reason for leaving. The point is that your feelings become so distorted that it is difficult to know what you truly feel, let alone make a wise decision.<\/p><p> As you bring mindfulness to your relationship, you begin to see that the mind endlessly grasps after things, clings to expectations, and resents your partner if he or she doesn't share the same values or does not meet your expectations. Love and affection are easily forgotten amidst such hindrances. The mind can so cling to images of how things are supposed to be that \"what is\" is never explored as a chance for deepening love.<\/p><p> When you are more mindful in a relationship, you become aware of how difficult it is to stay vulnerable when there is so much anxiety. Additionally, you discover that without a conscious commitment to staying emotionally present in the relationship no matter what arises, there's a tendency to abandon love and trust when either of you makes a mistake, diminishing the chance that you will ever grow closer together. Relationships inevitably involve feeling vulnerable, fearful, uncertain, and disappointed—how else could it be? Yet the untrained mind is not equipped to maintain equanimity, let alone compassion and loving-kindness, in the face of these difficulties. There is also the tendency to want, even expect, your love relationship to heal your childhood wounds, to be a source of unconditional love and endless praise to help you overcome self-loathing, or to rescue you from your boredom and unhappiness or from your lack of purpose. Being more grounded in your spiritual practice provides the strength and awareness to cope with all of these problems. Worked with mindfully, relationships become a vessel to help you travel deeper into yourself and, in time, to become more self-contained and less fearful or needy.<\/p><p><em>See also<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/video/video/happy-days/\">A Sequence For Happy Days<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"><\/a><\/p><h3>Unhealthy Relationships<\/h3><p> It is imperative, however, that you be able to make the distinction between a relationship that is healthy and one that is unhealthy at its core. Basically, in an unhealthy relationship, your sense of an open, vulnerable self is ravaged and your connection to Spirit is suppressed, as is your spontaneity. You have no sense of possibility for inner development and feel shut off from the joy of life. These unhealthy conditions may arise because of abusive psychological, emotional, or physical factors or because of strong incompatibility that offers no possibility of negotiation. The relationship deadens Spirit; you feel lifeless inside. Your partner might be the one at fault, or you, or both, either because of personal wounds or because the two of you are simply mismatched. If you repeatedly experience the relationship as having an unhealthy core, ending it may be the wise and compassionate course of action.<\/p><p> However, not getting exactly what you want materially from a relationship and not having your sexual needs met does not automatically make a relationship unhealthy at its core. Likewise, not receiving the praise you desire or the lifestyle you had hoped for, or being disappointed that your partner does not have the personality traits you would prefer, does not necessarily mean a relationship is unhealthy. Any one or more of these conditions could indicate your relationship is fundamentally unhealthy, or it may simply mean that you have work to do in these areas of your relationship and that you need to examine your expectations. This doesn't mean you can't choose to leave a relationship for these secondary reasons, but there is a big difference between leaving because of difficulty and dissatisfaction and leaving as a matter of urgency due to an unhealthy core.<\/p><h3>Option 1: Trust in Each Other<\/h3><p> If you want to try making relationship your yoga, there are three models of healthy manifestations of love that you might consider exploring. Mindfulness can help you with each. The first is what I call \"two healthy egos at the center,\" which is based on a balanced, honest exchange between two people.<\/p><p> This is the modern ideal of what relationships and intimacy are supposed to be. It is a union of equals, a partnership. Each partner desires to act in a way that is helpful, empowering, and loving to the other. And likewise, each partner expects to receive an equal amount of attention and help in return. This fair exchange includes mutual decision making, sharing of the work, and equal respect for the values and needs of each other.<\/p><p><em>See also<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/create-a-life-you-love/\">Create A Life You Love<\/a><\/p><p> In a healthy version of this partnership exchange, each person genuinely wants to be fair in giving to the other. This means that even if one partner has some advantage, such that he does not have to give as much as he receives, there is still no exploitation. Each partner gives a fair exchange, ignoring any power advantage. Why? Because each person believes that giving love to the other is a reward in itself. Therefore, the relationship has warmth and spontaneity at its core.<\/p><p> You can see why this kind of relationship requires two healthy egos. If either one of you always feels needy or inadequate, the capacity for generosity of spirit is lacking. Not that you are always going to feel and act loving toward each other, or that you are always supposed to be in agreement about what is fair or whether you or your partner is doing his or her share. What matters is your intention to base the relationship on a fair exchange, and you trust each other that this is so.<\/p><p> You can use mindfulness to stay present in a partnership relationship and to acknowledge \"what is\" rather than what your ego wants to be true. Your practice can help you avoid defensiveness and getting caught in fear, and help you give up being controlled by your needs. When the partnership model fails, it is because one or both partners aren't in touch with their own emotions or because of unrealistic expectations. The relationship deteriorates into dysfunctional cynicism, and bargaining takes over as both partners try to protect themselves.<\/p><p> From the perspective of using romantic love as a path to spiritual development, the partnership relationship model is ultimately limited, because your happiness and sense of well-being are based on having your ego needs met. You are not establishing an independent, inner relationship to the love energy that is associated with Spirit. The dharma teaches that everything changes, including relationships—you get sick, or the other person is injured, or your needs change. Something will happen that will cause your ego to take a loss, and you will not have prepared yourself by establishing a more lasting basis for happiness.<\/p><p><em>See also<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/beginners/miraculous-practice/\">Miraculous Practice: How Yoga Leads to Transformation<\/a><\/p><h3>Option 2: Trust in Love<\/h3><p> The second option for a healthy relationship includes some or all of the healthy exchange of the partnership, but is based more on the idea of love being connected to Spirit. I call this option \"love and ego at the center.\" In the partnership model, your ego sense of self is at the center of the relationship and the relationship is about having your sense of self become ever more healthy. In this second option, your ego is still at the center, but the center has expanded to include a direct experience of love that is independent of ego needs. Therefore, love shares the center with you, and both you and your partner can become the beneficiaries of that love.<\/p><p> Can you see how radically different this type of relationship is? How many more possibilities of a meaningful life it offers to those who are ready for it? You are no longer keeping score, because you are not thinking in terms of an exchange, but rather your primary relationship is with love itself. Your partner represents your commitment to connection and nonseparation, just as was true with courtly love. He or she is the recipient and the inspiration for your deeper relationship to love, but you are not requiring him or her to buy, barter, or otherwise earn your love in any way.<\/p><p> This model will not work in an unhealthy relationship; it has to be enacted with someone who can at least meet the partnership model of love. When love and ego are at the center, you are not abandoning or martyring yourself. Instead, you are giving up certain expectations, which means that your relationship to the energy of love is not dependent on your partner. Your capacity to love grows based on your ever-deepening maturity. The delight in giving happiness to another is at the core. You see your partner through the lens of love, not because he or she is perfect, but because love is not about judging, keeping score, or seeking advantage. It is simply expressing itself.<\/p><p> In this type of relationship, your partner might be less than you desire and there may be many challenges, but these disappointments are not devastating to you, because your happiness is based on the experience of nonselfish love. It is similar to a parent's love for a child. If that love is healthy, the parent does not measure love with the child nor expect an equal exchange; it is the feeling of pleasure in giving that is important. This expanded notion of love is possible only if you believe there is an energetic space in the psyche that is love, with which you can enter into a relationship.<\/p><p><em>See also<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/relationships/healing-heartbreak-yoga-practice-get-grief/\">Healing Heartbreak: A Yoga Practice To Get Through Grief<\/a><\/p><p> You can see why this option of loving invigorates your dharma practice. Your ego, although still at the center, is slowly transformed by this love that is not based on ego needs. It is this kind of love energy that leads to the Buddhist <em>bodhichitta<\/em> vow of dedication to the liberation of all beings. You are moving from a personal, self-interested love to an impersonal love that can spread from your partner to other people, and finally to all beings.<\/p><p> In this relationship model, all three aspects of love—agape, eros, and filia—are present and engaging you; however, it is the emphasis on selfless love that makes it such a rich option. You can also be the one who loves love in other aspects of your life. For instance, if you have others reporting to you at work, you can extend your relationship from simply being the one in charge, expecting others to perform, to one who mentors and helps them succeed. In a true mentoring role, you go beyond mere exchange. You may well help others grow to the point that they leave you for a better job. What you receive is the satisfaction of watching them grow and the pleasure of knowing that you are supporting transformation in another person. You can do the same in friendships and in your extended family.<\/p><p> The shadow side of this option is that it can deteriorate into a codependent relationship or martyrdom, neither of which is love—neither is compassionate or skillful. This option can also be misused to rationalize or avoid something that needs to be negotiated, or to manipulate the other person, or to deny your own feelings. Mindfulness helps prevent these shadow sides from occurring.<\/p><h3>Option 3: Trust in the Dharma<\/h3><p> The third option for making relationship your yoga I call \"love alone at the center.\" This represents the practice of fully surrendering all or part of your ego wants in your relationship. You give up any expectation that your needs will be met. If they're met, that's great; if they're not, your practice is to pay no mind and not allow your giving of love to be affected. This is the ultimate practice in nonattachment and in making your relationship your dharma. Not that you submit to abusive or destructive behavior, but rather you forsake normal expectations. Sounds daunting, doesn't it? It shows how dominant the partnership model is.<\/p><p><em>See also<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/the-dharma-of-life-changes/\">The Dharma Of Life Changes<\/a><\/p><p> The very idea of approaching a relationship in this manner seems strange or even dysfunctional. So why would you consider such an option? The people that I know who have chosen this path have done so for one of two reasons: Either their relationship was bad but they didn't think leaving was the right thing to do (and they had a spiritual practice as well as a network of support that could sustain them in such an undertaking), or they were in a healthy relationship but were so far along in their practice that it seemed like the natural next step toward their liberation. A \"love alone at the center\" relationship in which both people have the healthy ability to love is inspiring to witness. And in the few instances I have known in which someone was practicing this option in a difficult situation, it was quite beautiful and even more inspiring. It was as if the human spirit was conquering <em>duhkha<\/em> (the unsatisfactory aspects of life) with love. I want to stress that this option is not about sacrificing yourself or allowing wrong action. It simply means responding to daily frustrations and disappointments with love, over and over again. This is hard work, and to do it you have to genuinely let go of attachment. No wonder Ram Dass called it the hardest yoga!<\/p><p> A less challenging practice is to let go of your expectations in a single area of the relationship. I know many people who have encountered one area of continual dissatisfaction in a relationship, vowed to love their way through it, and succeeded in doing so. In those situations, the other parts of the relationship were sufficiently strong to justify such a choice. By letting go in just one aspect of need in their relationship, those people experienced genuine growth that empowered the rest of their lives.<\/p><p> If you are considering this third option, you would never announce it to your partner. It is something you do internally. Your relationship to this kind of love is fragile and needs to be guarded from either of you using it in a manipulative manner in your moments of tension. Obviously, you do need to talk with someone you trust and respect to do a reality check with yourself. It is also OK to try this option and not be able to do it. It does not mean that you are a failure; it simply means that it was not an appropriate expression for you at that time.<\/p><h3>Love vs. Desire<\/h3><p> When I discussed these three options with the woman seeking my advice, she questioned each in a reflective manner. Finally, she said, \"The first one just isn't going to work right now. The relationship does not feel like a partnership, so if that's what I want, I should just leave. I have no interest in the third option, but the second one is something I want to explore. It sort of matches how I've been feeling, so maybe I have been doing it a little bit already.\" I told her that most of us tend to find ourselves in a combination of the three options with another person, a combination that is always changing.<\/p><p><em>See also<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/your-heart-s-desire/\">Your Heart's Desire<\/a><\/p><p> By bringing mindfulness into relationship, you gain the power to consciously participate in both how your relationship develops and how you develop as a loving person. Relationship will not lose its messiness or its disappointments, but by making it a practice, even the difficulties become meaningful. Your commitment to love becomes the ground from which you meet whatever life brings. I did not know what would happen with this woman in her own relationship, but I was confident that if she opened herself to it in this manner, there was the possibility of inner transformation. She would be making relationship her yoga.<\/p><p> Yogis who have lived for years without a relationship often ask me what any of this has to do with them. If you are filled with loneliness, wanting, or resentment toward your situation, you can bring your attention to these understandable feelings, which are hindrances to your own happiness. By sitting with them and applying compassion and loving-kindness, they will burn even brighter for a while, and this heat will help purify the torment they cause in your mind. You may see that your life is the way it is, not as you would have it be, and that if you are ever to have love, it has to arise from the place where you are.<\/p><p> If you are no longer interested in intimate relationships, then your practice can be to start manifesting love in all of its forms, whenever the opportunity arises. It may be at work, with family, in serving others, or with nature. I don't mean anything sappy by this, but rather that you begin to cultivate a quiet sense of good intention and openness to meeting and appreciating life however it appears in front of you.<\/p><p> The spiritual aspect of love is at its heart a paradox. We know that it is sacred and timeless, yet for us it is able to manifest only in time; therefore, it so easily becomes mixed up with our wants. T.S. Eliot wrote in Four Quartets: \"Desire itself is movement, not in itself desirable; /Love is itself unmoving, /Only the cause and end of movement, /Timeless, and undesiring /Except in the aspect of time...\"<\/p><p><em>See also<\/em><a href=\"http://www.yogajournal.com/article/yoga-101/gotta/\">Transform Desire Into Results<\/a><\/p><p> Opening to the possibility of making love your dharma practice means exploring the difference Eliot points to between love and desire. Bringing mindfulness to your relationship to love allows you to more fully participate in its power. Life becomes multidimensional, and you start to discover new capacities within yourself. You learn to work with the inevitable difficulties and disappointments that arise in all types of relationships. Slowly those emotions, which you previously knew only as reasons to suffer, also become opportunities for exploring the mystery of being a flawed human being loving other flawed human beings.<\/p><h3>Phillip Moffitt is the founder of the Life Balance Institute and a member of the Teachers Council at Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre, CA.<\/h3>","primarySectionIds":["ci0207568d10392620","ci0207568dd00725bd"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci0207568dd00725bd","primaryImageId":"ci02075697f0002620","path":"/yoga-101/the-yoga-of-relationships","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci0207568dd00725bd"},{"$ref":"ci0207568d10392620"}],"socialPopularity":4,"slug":"the-yoga-of-relationships","contentNodeId":"cn020756a0700425bd","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2017-04-03T20:14:03Z","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-04-03T20:14:03Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci02075698b0112620","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","isNoindex":false,"title":"Phillip Moffitt","slug":"phillip-moffitt","disqusId":"1434156e-18aa-11e7-88b7-025a1927d20b","path":"/author/phillip-moffitt","migrationId":"ContentUserProfile:phillip-moffitt"},"teaser":"Be open to the possibility of meshing your ideas of romance with your spiritual values and dharma practice for a better relationship.","promoTitle":"The Yoga Of Relationships","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"facebook":{"acceleration":2.90934e-14,"velocity":3.41136e-7,"estimate":1.3766562523509833,"lastCount":4},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0}},"dek":"Be open to the possibility of meshing your ideas of romance with your spiritual values and dharma practice for a better relationship.","migrationId":"0ec79ec26f6b2c37957731c5b250530b9ec999f3","ownerId":null,"metaTitle":"The Yoga Of Relationships| Yoga & Romance"},{"authorProfileId":"ci0207569970132620","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2007-08-28T16:21:50Z","sectionIds":[["ci0207568d60372620"],["ci0207568d10392620","ci0207568dd00725bd"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"metaDescription":"","id":"ci020756b1802c2620","geoCoordinates":{},"objectType":"ContentArticle","isNoindex":false,"title":"Yoga:  The Path to Universal Being","editedTimestamp":"2017-05-24T16:16:25Z","disqusId":"01b5c3f6-18ab-11e7-88b9-025a1927d20b","autoSaved":false,"tmlEmbeds":[],"sectionsLeafNode":["ci0207568d60372620","ci0207568dd00725bd"],"bodyTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p>\"AUM TAT SAT is declared to be the threefold designation of the absolute Acts of sacrifice, charity and austerity as enjoined by the sacred texts are always commenced with the utterance of the word 'AUM' by those noble souls who are given to reciting the Vedic chants.

Mantras have the power to awaken consciousness. One of the great mantras used to achieve this is often used as a greeting in India. Instead of just saying \"hello\" or \"how are you?\" yogis will often say Hari Om or Hari Om Tat Sat.<\/p><p> Hari means \"the manifest cosmos,\" AUM \"the unmanifest invisible realm,\" Tat means \"that\" and Sat means \"the ultimate reality.\" Therefore, this greeting helps awaken us to our true nature. We remind ourselves and others that we are much more than just a body and mind. We hold in our awareness the truth that we are both an individual being and also a higher consciousness; that there is a vast absolute consciousness that is both invisible and at the heart of all manifested forms. We should never forget this; it is the essence of yoga.<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> Yoga teaches us to develop ourselves as individual beings and as universal beings. This article will help us develop a clearer view of the difference between individual consciousness and existence and universal consciousness and existence. It is only when we hold this understanding in our awareness that we can aim our <a href=\"/practice/\">yoga practice<\/a> so as to really connect these two parts of ourself. When we do this, we can help our students do the same.<\/p><p><strong>The journey from individual to universal consciousness<\/strong><\/p><p> The individual personality is composed of a body-mind and an individual, localised consciousness. The individual consciousness is localised to one fragment of time and space, one little identity. Its true nature is non-localised consciousness, but only a fragment of our consciousness is awakened. The rest is asleep or unconscious. This is why we experience ourselves as individuals--our consciousness is like a small candle flame in a moonless night. It does not yet have the power of a sun which can illumine all of space. And so we cannot experience the vast transcendent part of ourselves which, according to the Upanishads, shines like a million suns.<\/p><p> Because our awareness is limited, we can only feel a small part of ourselves. Therefore, we develop a little personality which identifies with that small part of ourselves. We feel separate from the world around us and seek \"yoga\": union with life, with something greater than what we think and feel we are. What we aim to unite with is the universal consciousness, with our true Self. We are like fish swimming in an ocean, yet are unaware that vast waters surround them. In the same way, we are a limited consciousness in a vast universal consciousness but we are unaware of its existence; we cannot feel or experience it.<\/p><p> The universal consciousness is the totality of our being. It is non-localised consciousness. Universal consciousness is not stuck in one place but is both contained within and also transcends space and time. The mantra which signifies universal consciousness is AUM.<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> Yogic and tantric philosophies teach us that the universal consciousness has dual aspects of cosmic consciousness and cosmic energy/matter. These aspects of energy/matter and consciousness interpenetrate each other and cannot be separated in the same way that light and heat cannot be separated form the sun. There is a world of form which is manifest existence and there is a world which of formlessness, a realm of pure consciousness. The process of studying these two poles of our being is a truly powerful, joyful, and awe-inspiring journey as it is an enquiry into our essence and the essence of the universe.<\/p><p><strong>The yogic path<\/strong><\/p><p> The yogic journey begins with the individual personality seeking to understand and cultivate itself. We learn how to have a healthy body and a strong calm mind, and how to relate to the world with greater skill and awareness. This first stage of yogic exploration is aimed at developing a balanced, healthy and integrated individual personality.<\/p><p> The second stage of yogic study develops our relationship and connection with the higher and more universal aspects of ourself. This process can only really come about in an embodied and experiential sense when we have completed some preliminary work on the little body-mind. Prior to this, the universal self is just an intellectual concep, not a lived presence.<\/p><p> The third stage of yogic study leads us to the final goal of yoga, in which we merge with the absolute, unlimited part of ourselves and realise that we are both the fish and the ocean. This is the ultimate attainment in yoga and only comes after we have done a great deal of work on ourselves. However, it is important to remember that this goal exists.<\/p><p><strong>Consciousness-awareness and energy<\/strong><\/p><p> The individual human personality has two fundamental aspects: awareness and energy. Awareness is synonymous with consciousness. It is the eternal, unchanging, immaterial, invisible aspect of being. It has no personality or characteristics and is our true nature and essence. It is that with which the yogi wishes to unite.<\/p><p> Energy, on the other hand, is the eternally changing aspect which has infinite characteristics and forms. It is energy which creates, shapes, and drives our body-mind--the visible and tangible part of ourselves. Energy is equivalent with matter and is the source of all manifestation. From the unmanifest invisible universe comes the visible universe, the universe of names and forms. Living forms are vehicles which carry individual consciousness. Individual consciousness is either awake, dreaming, or asleep.<\/p><p> Yoga has two main divisions of teaching. The first division is the cultivation of awareness, and the second is the development of inner skills, strength, and creative intelligence that allows us to manipulate and master the body-mind. The more aware we are, the more we can access our own innate intelligence and intuition. The more aware and intelligent we are, the more skilfully we can perform the various yogic techniques so as to make positive, powerful, creative and lasting changes, changes that improve our lives and the lives of others.<\/p><p> From a practical point of view, yoga is the system that allows us to place our awareness into the energetic systems of the body-mind so that we can feel parts of ourselves that have become unconscious, that have been cut off from feeling. Awareness allows us to feel more and to feel connected. The less awareness we have, the more cut off and disconnected we feel. This whole process creates health and mental strength as a by-product.<\/p><p> As <a href=\"/for_teachers/\">yoga teachers<\/a>, one of the best things we can do is continually reinforce the awareness of what we are doing rather than the idealised and perfected technique. By reinforcing awareness, students can become more aware of their processes and better apply their own creative intelligence and intuition to their <a href=\"/practice/\">yoga practice<\/a>. This cultivates skill, creativity and joy.<\/p><p><strong>Seeing ourselves<\/strong><\/p><p> Yoga trains our body, mind and spirit, transforming our nervous system and mind so that we can attain, maintain, and sustain higher awareness. It is not easy to become a more conscious being; there are parts of us we would prefer not to see. However, one of the aims of yoga is to reconnect to that which is invisible within us, and as we become more conscious we will definitely see, feel, and experience more of ourselves, including the \"good bits\" and the \"bad bits\"; dark and light coexist within.<\/p><p> The more awareness we have, the greater the light we shine into our being, illuminating that which has been kept in darkness. If we do not deal with these aspects of ourselves, they remain unconscious but continue to act. If left in the dark, these forces become \"demonic,\" turning against us and making us do things we would rather not do and feel things we would rather not feel. For example, we might develop dependencies and addictions to food, drugs, or people.<\/p><p> Yoga provides the tools to develop our body-mind, to manage our energy and life-force, and to cultivate awareness. It gives us the tools to awaken awareness so that we can feel more of ourselves and also gives us the tools to manage any weakness we find. In this way, we do not feel helpless and unable to manage the internal forces of the body-mind, the unruly thoughts and emotions. The philosophical side of yoga also gives us tools in the form of higher goals and higher principles that can guide our lives so that we can develop a deep and abiding relationship with higher forces and higher consciousness. We just need to know how to apply these tools. Ultimately these tools are the path to self-realisation.<\/p><p> Hari AUM Tat Sat<\/p><p><strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> Dr Swami Shankardev Saraswati is an eminent yoga teacher, author, medical doctor, and yoga therapist.

But most modern students learn asana first, without reference to the other essential limbs on the tree of yoga. If you teach <a href=\"/basics/820\">hatha yoga<\/a>, it can be difficult to ground the teaching in classical philosophy. Here we offer ways to seamlessly incorporate the five ni<a href=\"/for_teachers/984\">yamas<\/a> into an asana class.<\/p><p><strong>Saucha (Cleanliness)<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> The most common translation of <em>saucha<\/em> is \"cleanliness.\" But saucha, at its root, is concerned with keeping different energies distinct. Saucha ensures and protects the sanctity of the energy around us. We can teach saucha through focusing on the grossest physical concerns (such as asking students to come to class without strong body odors, and to wipe off sweat-drenched mats) as well as more subtle energetic issues.<\/p><p> There are several ways to incorporate the teachings of saucha. The first is to teach students put away their mats, props, and blankets in an orderly manner, with all the edges aligned, so that no one else will have to arrange them. This practice will help students cultivate an awareness of their surroundings.<\/p><p> Tell your students to be mindful of other students' mats and to refrain from stepping on them as they cross the room to get props or go to the wall. Not only is this a hygienic practice, it also teaches the importance of keeping the energy of their own practice distinct from the energy of others. In asana practice, the mat represents the world-the way we treat our mat reflects the way we treat our world. As we teach our students to handle their mats with care, we are helping them learn the essence of respect for all things.<\/p><p> Tell your students that when they sit in straight lines or circles, the energies around them flow in an orderly fashion, and this keeps the energy of the room clean. If the mats are not arranged in an orderly way, one student's energy interferes with the energy of another. When students are positioned neatly, a synergistic effect takes place-the effect of one student's work and energy helps the rest of the class do the pose. Likewise, the energy of the collective group helps each individual do the pose.<\/p><p> Chanting <em>om<\/em> or leading similar chants at the beginning of class creates a separation between the outward focus of the normal day and the inward focus of the <a href=\"/practice/\">yoga practice<\/a>. Chanting <em>om<\/em> again at the end of class seals the energy of the practice before moving back out into the world. Such a separation of energies is, once again, saucha.<\/p><p><strong>Samtosha (Contentment)<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> During an asana class, tell those students who are working excessively hard that it is time to practice <em>samtosha<\/em>, being content with what they have attained. Encourage them to accept that they may not yet be ready for what they are attempting to do. Remind them that if they can't get into the deepest version of a pose, it doesn't mean that their poses are \"bad.\" Instead, they are simply as good as they can be today, and they will be better tomorrow. In <em>Light on Yoga<\/em> (B.K.S. Iyengar, Schocken), you won't see a single pose in which Iyengar looks tense or upset. If you notice students' faces contorting and overexerting in a pose, tell them to stop and reestablish a calm breath and the feeling of samtosha. Only then, in that spirit, should they resume the practice of the pose. This quality of contentment leads to mental peace.<\/p><p><strong>Tapas (Heat, Perseverance)<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> When a student is not working hard enough, it's time to encourage the practice of <em>tapas<\/em>. Wise effort can be discerned as the difference between someone who simply fantasizes and someone who is on the path toward their dreams. Effort is required to make anything bear fruit in the physical world, and yet we have to balance tapas with samtosha-effort with contentment. If we try to force things, we will end up doing harm.<\/p><p> If a student feels intimidated by a pose, as if they simply cannot do it, scale down the pose in such a way that it leaves the person thinking, \"I wish I could have done more.\" Since the person is used to being overwhelmed, underwhelm them! This will build in them the desire to do more. My brother once used this technique to get his daughter to eat her vegetables. When she resisted eating, he would put just one or two peas on her plate. She would quickly and easily eat these, and then demand more.<\/p><p><strong>Svadhyaya (Study of One's Self)<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\"><em>Sva<\/em> means \"self\" and <em>adhyaya<\/em> means \"education of.\" <em>Svadhyaya<\/em> is, in essence, the study of one's self. This is largely accomplished through careful self-observation. During class, we must constantly encourage our students to look within and feel what is going on inside their bodies. After working in a pose, ask them to pause, become still, and feel the changes. This builds self-awareness, the foundation of svadhyaya.<\/p><p> From the very first class, tell your students that, when they are practicing, they are all alone, even though they are in a class full of people. Emphasize that they are not in competition with their neighbors. The focus during <a href=\"/practice/\">yoga practice<\/a> has to be completely internal. This approach not only nurtures self-knowledge, it also prevents physical injury because your students will be more aware of what they are doing, and they will stop before they hurt themselves.<\/p><p> As <a href=\"/for_teachers/\">yoga teachers<\/a>, it's our responsibility to help students develop a practice of constant inner reflection so that they will become aware of the changes that yoga is making. This can be done by asking such questions as, \"Why are you here? If you had all the money, all the time, all the energy you wanted, what would you do with your life?\" In my teaching, I find that these sorts of questions stimulate the practice of svadhyaya.<\/p><p> Another way to encourage svadhyaya is to quote from respected scriptures in class. If you regularly quote from <a href=\"/wisdom/2208\">Patanjali<\/a>'s <a href=\"/wisdom/462\">Yoga Sutra<\/a>, you encourage your students to develop an interest in further exploring them on their own.<\/p><p><strong>Ishvara pranidhana (Surrender to God)<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> Most students are very concerned with \"getting there.\" They want results. They want to achieve. Explain to them that it is not the results that matter, because the results lie in the hands of the Divine; it is our intention and effort that count.<\/p><p> Teach your students that they are part of a universal force. With this in mind, they don't have to work only for themselves, because there is a bigger purpose. In a sense, we are actors playing out our own part-our own dharma on the massive stage of life. When yoga students truly understand this, they become less obsessed with themselves and the results they create. They will be able to do yoga with both intensity and calmness when they dedicate practice to a universal life force of which we are all a part.<\/p><p> God, as the name for the universal life force, is worshipped in different forms by every religion and faith.

Yet, respecting our students may involve behaving in ways that are at odds with normal, everyday notions of what it means to be respectful. In this article, I discuss the most significant ways my teaching has changed over the past thirty years, as I continue to learn how to put my student's individual needs above the desires of my ego and the conventions of communication.<\/p><p><strong>No Choice<\/strong><\/p><p> We want to empower our students. We want to help them express their potential, awaken them to possibilities, and give them choices in life. Oddly, on the way to this destination, it is often best to give our students no choice at all.<\/p><p> Imagine you are learning to sail and, in the very first lesson, the teacher says to you, \"You can use the small sail, or the mid-size sail, or the big sail to move forward. You choose.\" You would have no idea which sail to use. Even though it might be correct to use any one of them, having so many choices would be confusing. You would want your teacher to tell you what to do, at least at first. Only later, once you knew more about sailing, could you make the choice without confusion.<\/p><p> In yoga class, we do not give beginners a choice as to how to do the pose. When teaching Trikonasana, for example, if you tell a beginner to choose between putting a brick or a pad under her hand, placing her hand on her leg, or setting her fingertips on the floor, she will find the decision extremely confusing. Most beginners have neither the awareness in their bodies nor the knowledge of yoga to be able to make such a choice. The answer is to instruct everyone in the group to get a brick and put their hands on the brick. Beginners must be told exactly what to do and should not have to make a choice.<\/p><p> What if you see someone in your class who cannot reach the brick? Give that person another direction individually. What if a number of people cannot reach the brick? To such a mixed-level class I might say, \"Everyone, please put your hand on the floor.\" Then, after they attempt this, I say, \"Now, those of you who cannot reach the floor, go the back of the room and get a brick. Those of you who cannot reach the brick, go to the wall and put your hand on the wall.\" Here again, though there may appear to be a choice, it is not left to the student to make the decision as to whether she should do one action or the other. We are merely clarifying the situation so that students then knows exactly what to do. It all depends on her ability.<\/p><p><strong>Repetition<\/strong><\/p><p> We want our students to progress, and we naturally want to share all our helpful ideas, and so we may feel we are doing our students a favor by giving them something new every class. As I look back on thirty years of teaching, I see that this has been my attitude and, though it has made my classes interesting to me, it has not served my students. Often, the best way to respect our student's desire to grow is to repeat the old once again in a new way, to establish it in their bodies and provide the stable foundation for the knowledge to come. As the proverb says, \"Repetition is the mother of all skills.\"<\/p><p> If students are doing a twist but cannot master the shoulder movement, then we should ask them to repeat that shoulder movement on each side three times. It's similar to the way in which a pianist practices a piano piece, working on a small part of a difficult passage over and over until it becomes second nature. Repetition is especially important when teaching complex movements. For example, in teaching students to jump the feet apart in standing poses, I teach students to bring their feet together and jump apart many, many times, until they get the feel of it. In this way, it becomes a part of their memory and nervous systems.<\/p><p> This principle of repetition applies on a larger scale, too. Suppose we want to teach the concept of rooting and recoiling. If we work on this in every class for a month, applying the same concept to different postures and sequences, our students will remember rooting and recoiling for a lifetime. Repeated often enough, any concept becomes a part of our nervous system and memory, and we then remember it without effort.<\/p><p><strong>Less Detail (No More Than Three Points At Once)<\/strong><\/p><p> As teachers, we strive to help our student explore the myriad details in each pose to refine their awareness. However, we often teach too many details too soon. As a result, our students suffer the ill effects of \"paralysis of analysis,\" their brains drowning in a plethora of facts. When they think fervently about all the refinements they have to accomplish, they do none of them effectively.<\/p><p> The level of detail necessary for beginners is just enough to keep them safe. Focus on this first. Later, give the students the details they need to refine the posture and feel the energy of the pose. We as teachers must know the difference between the foundational details of a pose that are necessary for safety, and the advanced detailsthe nuances, the subtletiesthat make a posture's effect more refined and powerful. It is important to keep in mind that our students are learning a whole new art. They are entering a new world and to flood them with details (just because we know them) is, at best premature, and, at worst, paralyzing.<\/p><p> I suggest explaining no more than three points at any one time and explaining these points one at a time. If somebody starts to tell us a recipe with more than three ingredients, we reach for pen and paper. If, on the other hand, we are told, \"All you need is three ingredients to make boiled ricerice, water, and some butter,\" then we think, \"I can remember that.\" In the same way, if our instructions have too many points, our students' minds become tense and they begin to think they will never keep the instructions straight. This may not only prevent them from remembering the points but even from trying the pose at home.<\/p><p><strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\"> Recognized as one of the world's top <a href=\"/for_teachers/\">yoga teachers<\/a>, Aadil Palkhivala began studying yoga at the age of seven with B.K.S.

We can live and teach the whole of yoga as delineated in <a href=\"/wisdom/2208\">Patanjali<\/a>'s <em>Yoga Sutra<\/em>, or we can simply focus on the physical practice of asana. If we choose the whole of yoga, the first two steps on the ladder of the eightfold path are the <a href=\"/for_teachers/984\">yamas<\/a> and niyamas. These ethical and spiritual observances help us develop the more profound qualities of our humanity.<\/p><p> The name of the first limb of the eighfold path, <em>yama,<\/em> originally meant \"bridle\" or \"rein.\" Patanjali used it to describe a restraint that we willingly and joyfully place on ourselves to focus our efforts, the way a rein allows a rider to guide his horse in the direction he would like to go. In this sense, self-restraint can be a positive force in our lives, the necessary self-discipline that allows us to head toward the fulfillment of our dharma, or life purpose. The five yamas—<strong>kindness, truthfulness, abundance, continence,<\/strong> and <strong>self-reliance<\/strong>—are oriented toward our public behavior and allow us to coexist harmoniously with others.<\/p><p> \"What the teacher is, is more important than what he teaches,\" wrote Karl Menninger. The best way—perhaps the only true way—to teach the yamas is to live them. If we practice them in our actions and embody them in our manner, we become models for our students. We teach without even trying. Still, there are some specific ways to integrate discussions of the yamas into an asana class.<\/p><h3><a href=\"/wisdom/462\">Ahimsa<\/a><\/h3><p><em>Ahimsa<\/em> traditionally meant \"do not kill or hurt people.\" This can be extrapolated to mean that we should not be violent in feelings, thoughts, words, or actions. At root, ahimsa means maintaining compassion towards yourself and others. It means being kind and treating all things with care.<\/p><p> In class, we often see students being violent toward themselves—pushing when they should be pulling back, fighting when they need to surrender, forcing their bodies to do things they are not yet ready to do. When we see this kind of behavior, it is an opportune time to bring up the topic of ahimsa and explain that to be violent to the body means we are no longer listening to it. Violence and awareness cannot coexist. When we are forcing, we are not feeling. Conversely, when we are feeling, we cannot be forcing. One of the main purposes of yoga is to cultivate feeling and awareness in the body, and violence only achieves the opposite result.<\/p><h3>Satya<\/h3><p><em>Satya<\/em> means \"truth,\" or \"not lying.\" Practicing satya means being truthful in our feelings, thoughts, and words, and deeds. It means being honest with ourselves and with others.<\/p><p> When a student with stiff hips who can't do a backbend properly puffs out her chest to pretend to do a good one, this is a lie. This is being dishonest because a part of her body is actually not doing the pose at all. Teach your students to always assess themselves honestly, and to work at their own level, without need for apology. Encourage them to look at the whole of their pose, not just the flattering parts (nor just the unflattering parts). Teach them that a pose is too expensive if it is bought by selling ahimsa and satya.<\/p><h3>Asteya<\/h3><p><em>Asteya<\/em>, or \"not stealing,\" refers to the stealing that grows from believing we cannot create what we need. We steal because we misperceive the universe as lacking abundance or we think that there is not enough for everyone and that we will not receive in proportion to our giving. Because of this, asteya does not only consist of \"not stealing,\" but also of rooting out the subconscious beliefs of lack and scarcity that cause greed and hoarding in all their various manifestations.<\/p><p> When students hold back in a posture, or when they don't work to their full capacity, they may fear that there is not going to be enough energy to do the next pose. Teach your students that each pose gives the energy required to do it. It is only when we persist in feeling a lack of abundance that we hold back and do not put our whole selves into every pose.<\/p><h3>Brahmacharya<\/h3><p> We practice <em>brahmacharya<\/em> when we consciously choose to use our life force (especially the energy of sexuality) to express our dharma, rather than to frivolously dissipate it in an endless pursuit of fleeting pleasures. Brahmacharya reminds us that our life force is both limited and precious, and sexual activity is one of the quickest ways to deplete it. As yogis, we choose to use the power behind sexuality to create, to fulfill our mission, to find and joyously express our inner selves. The practice of brahmacharya is not some archaic form of moralizing, but rather a reminder that, if we use our energy wisely, we possess the resources to live a fulfilling life.<\/p><p> We can teach brahmacharya by helping our students learn to use the minimum energy to achieve the maximum result. Teach them not to use small muscles to do the work of large muscles, and to bring their minds into the poses so that their bodies do not become fatigued. Also, teach your students to channel lines of force and internal power, which will add energy to their lives.<\/p><p> In all poses, teach students to keep the lift of the pit of their abdomen, and explain to them that this actually conserves the life force. Tell them that dropping the lower belly splatters our life force out in front of us. Once conserved, this pelvic energy can be channeled up to the heart. In this way, we can continually teach brahmacharya in class, encouraging students to lift the pelvic energy toward the heart center, the home of the indwelling Self. After all, isn't this the true purpose of a complete yoga practice?<\/p><h3>Aparigraha<\/h3><p><em>Aparigraha<\/em> means not coveting what isn't ours. It is different from asteya, which asks us to avoid stealing that is motivated by a greed springing from a perceived lack of abundance. Aparigraha is the greed that is rooted in jealousy. The Mother used to say, \"Jealousy is a poison that is fatal to the soul.\" Jealousy means that we desire to be what someone else is, or to have what someone else has. Rather than finding who we are, we look at someone else and say, \"I want to be that.\" Aparigraha, in its essence, helps us discover our own selves so that we no longer feel the need to covet what someone else has, or be what someone else is.<\/p><p> Teach your students to always do their practice alone, even in a large class. Tell them not to look at others in the room and compare. When they compare, they start to covet the way other students do the asanas. Remind them to keep their gaze inward. This way, they will be working in their own body, at their own capacity, and not coveting what someone else has.<\/p><p> Kindness, truthfulness, abundance, continence, and self-reliance—living and teaching these yamas puts us on the fulfilling path of an all-encompassing yoga, an approach to the inner quest that makes us whole.<\/p><p><strong>This article is excerpted from \"Teaching the Yamas and Niyamas\" by Aadil Palkhivala.<\/strong><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci0207568d60372620","ci0207568df02125bd"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci0207568df02125bd","primaryImageId":"ci0207569bd0132620","path":"/teach/teaching-the-yamas-in-asana-class","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci0207569000002620"},{"$ref":"ci02075690700a25bd"},{"$ref":"ci0207568d10392620"},{"$ref":"ci0207568d60372620"},{"$ref":"ci0207568df02125bd"},{"$ref":"ci0207568dd00725bd"}],"socialPopularity":32,"slug":"teaching-the-yamas-in-asana-class","contentNodeId":"cn020756b4900425bd","authorProfile":{"$ref":"ci0207568e801025bd"},"teaser":"Although the best way to teach the yamas is to live them, here are some practical ways to incorporate their lessons into an asana class.","promoTitle":"Teaching the Yamas in Asana Class","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":6.57113e-14,"velocity":7.69026e-7,"estimate":3.933929622604694,"lastCount":9},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"facebook":{"acceleration":1.67929e-13,"velocity":0.00000196529,"estimate":10.06031251981858,"lastCount":23},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0}},"dek":"Although the best way to teach the yamas is to live them, here are some practical ways to incorporate their lessons into an asana class.","migrationId":"128435ee5e73d098070edee6b943e3213f9f1599","ownerId":null,"metaTitle":"Teaching the Yamas in Asana Class | Methods and Tips for Yoga Teachers"}],"moreResultsToken":"OTo5OjQ3MzBlNzZjMGFlOGI0MDhlZTEzYjk1YTA1YWY4NWU3"},"header":{"image":{"image":{"height":66,"cloudinaryVersionId":1489088870,"id":"ci020546de800024e0","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Section_Header_Art_XtraSmall_Related","primaryPhotoId":"ci020546de800024e0","width":1400,"publicId":"MTQ1NjAwNDgzODY2NzE1Mzc0","format":"svg","bytes":4758},"imageUrl":"https://www.yogajournal.com/.image/MTQ1NjAwNDgzODY2NzE1Mzc0/section_header_art_xtrasmall_related.svg"},"title":"Related","size":"XS","html":"<div class=\"m-component-header m-component-stack--header\"><div class=\"m-component-header--container mm-component-header--size-extra-small\"><h1 class=\"m-component-header--image\" role=\"heading\"><img src=\"https://www.yogajournal.com/.image/cs_srgb/MTQ1NjAwNDgzODY2NzE1Mzc0/section_header_art_xtrasmall_related.svg\" alt=\"Related\"><\/h1><\/div><\/div>"},"meta":["image"],"isCanvas":true,"type":"phxStandardTileHub","preloaded":true,"objectType":"config"}</script>
