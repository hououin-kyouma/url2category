        <p>From what we wear to what we say, as female Millennials, we are very&nbsp;influenced by the media.</p>
        <p>One of the fads we hear about often is crash diets, or "New Year" diets.</p>
        <p>I, for one, have <em>never</em> tried to diet, and I don't think any woman should feel pressured to.</p>
        <p>I grew up in a household where something was wrong if we weren't eating enough.</p>
        <p>My family is from Lebanon, and our Mediterranean diet was always very balanced and full of vegetables and proteins.</p>
        <p>Pita bread was basically used as a utensil.</p>
        <p>The pressure to diet was&nbsp;always very frowned upon and questioned.</p>
        <p>My mother would always tell us to eat more vegetables and reduce sugar intake if we wanted to lose weight, which is very reasonable and safe.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
        <p>With the extreme dieting of today, most women are setting themselves up for failure and an unhealthy health path.</p>
        <p>Rather than doing things to help increase our self-esteem and encourage self-love, we feel pressured to "fit in" to this idea of beauty and being thin.</p>
        <p>We need to remember all women are beautiful just as they are.</p>
        <p>I eat carbs, fried food and a lot of red meat. I am healthy, and I am very happy.</p>
        <p>Yes, as women we all want to look and feel good, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle should be priority.</p>
        <p>Extreme dieting won't make you love yourself more, but doing the things that make you happy — in moderation — will.</p>
        <p>Here are some tips on how to do it:</p>
        <h3>1. Enjoy everything in moderation.</h3>
        <p>Eat what you want and drink what you want, but do so in moderation.</p>
        <p>It is okay to enjoy the more delicious things in life like fries, white bread and champagne.</p>
        <p>Still, your diet should not&nbsp;only consist of these things.</p>
        <p>I love chocolate cupcakes, but if I ate one every day for a month, I would not feel&nbsp;well.</p>
        <h3>2. Be active.</h3>
        <p>Working out at the gym isn't for everyone, and realistically speaking, working out every day can be impossible for some.</p>
        <p>Regardless, do&nbsp;something that will make you feel good.</p>
        <p>Take your dog for a long walk every day, play tennis with your bestie every Saturday or have a dance party with your roommate.</p>
        <p>As long as it makes you feel mentally and physically well, go for it.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
        <p>Being active doesn't only have physical benefits, but it can also relieve stress.</p>
        <p>So, if being on a treadmill for 30 minutes at the gym doesn't do it for you, find an alternative activity.</p>
        <h3>3. Get to cooking, good-looking.</h3>
        <p>Yeah, eating out is super fun, and I am totally guilty of doing it way too often.</p>
        <p>Cooking at home, however, allows for a balanced meal.</p>
        <p>Also, you are aware of the ingredients going into your food.</p>
        <p>Hopefully you're cooking with all-natural, organic products, which is definitely a plus.</p>
        <p>With cooking at home, you can make sure you're including a protein, grain and veggie.</p>
        <h3>4. Take vitamins.</h3>
        <p>I'm not a big fan of any type of medication, but taking a multi-vitamin has definitely helped.</p>
        <p>Even though you may eat well, your body may not be getting enough vitamins from your food intake.</p>
        <p>Having the appropriate nutrients in your system, especially enough of them, can be really beneficial.</p>
        <h3>5. Snack between meals.</h3>
        <p>Every once in a while, I need a Dove Chocolate Miniature, but I'm normally snacking on veggies, nuts or fruits.</p>
        <p>This helps keep my metabolism moving, and it also gives me the energy I need to make it through the day.</p>
        <h3>6.&nbsp;Laughter is the best medicine.</h3>
        <p>Seriously, there have been published&nbsp;studies that prove laughter <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-relief/art-20044456" target="_blank">helps relieve stress</a>&nbsp;and improve your mood.</p>
        <p>Not only is it fun, but it also has physical benefits.&nbsp;Laugh your ass off.</p>
        <h3>7. Get your eight hours of sleep in.</h3>
        <p>According to the <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/benefits-of-sleep" target="_blank">division of sleep medicine</a> at Harvard Medical School, getting enough sleep every night (typically seven to eight hours) makes you more efficient during the day, increases your metabolism and allows you to retain more information.</p>
        <p>Sounds pretty good, huh?</p>
        <h3>8. Listen to what your body is craving.</h3>
        <p>Hungover? Craving a Costco hot dog? Go get one.</p>
        <p>Your body knows what it needs, so pay attention.</p>
        <p>Don't get too bogged down in your healthy lifestyle, or you'll go insane.</p>
        <h3>9. Start your day with 16 ounces of water.</h3>
        <p>Our bodies are made of <a href="http://water.usgs.gov/edu/propertyyou.html" target="_blank">approximately 55 to 60 percent water</a>.</p>
        <p>Starting your day off with water will help jump-start your system.</p>
        <p>Who doesn't want to be hydrated?</p>
        <p>Infusing your water with fruits or lemon is beneficial and tasty.</p>
        <h3>10. Eat breakfast every day.</h3>
        <p>If you take anything from this article, it's knowing breakfast is the most important meal of the day.</p>
        <p>It provides your body and brain with the energy it needs to get moving.</p>
        <p>Your breakfast can be super easy, like yogurt, fruit, granola, oatmeal, cereal or eggs.</p>
        <p>Just watch out for those sugars!</p>
        <p>Be healthy, be free, be happy and love who you are.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of ways to look and feel good without depriving your body of what it needs.</p>
