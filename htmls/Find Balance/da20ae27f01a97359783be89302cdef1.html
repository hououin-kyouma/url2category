I ate lots of junk food. I thought an occasional tennis game was all the exercise I needed. I never really thought about what I was doing. I just did what all my friends did. If I hadnât changed what I was doing, I might have had a short, unhealthy life.</p> 
           <p>Of course, I did change, and those changes made all the difference. Now Iâm in my 70s, and Iâm in perfect health. I have no diseases. Even the allergies I had when I was younger have gone away as I improved my diet and lifestyle. I am on no medications. I have the blood pressure of a 16-year-old.</p> 
           <p>I call this article âHow to Live a Healthy Lifestyle:&nbsp; Wish I Knew At 20â, but this article isnât about me. I wrote this article for all the other 20-year-olds who know as little about nutrition and health as I did at 20. I also wrote this article for all those people who havenât changed â those people with the same diet and lifestyle they had at 20. Itâs never too late to change and begin to live a healthy lifestyle.</p> 
           <p>&nbsp;</p> 
           <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #339966;">How to Live a Healthy Lifestyle:&nbsp; What I Wish I Knew At 20</h2> 
           <p>&nbsp;</p> 
           <p>Here are 15 tips I would pass along to all the 20-year-olds, even those 20-year-olds in older bodies:</p> 
           <p><strong>#1: You Are In Charge:</strong> You have a brain. You have free will. You donât have to do what everyone else is doing. It is time to start thinking about what your health and your life will be like if you donât change. More importantly, it is time to start thinking about what your health and your life could be like if you do make positive changes.</p> 
           <p><strong>#2: It Matters:</strong> I canât emphasize strongly enough how important it is to make positive changes in your diet, your exercise, and your overall lifestyle. We know all the major killer diseases (heart disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, etc) are affected by diet and lifestyle. However, it is much more than avoiding disease. As you age, your quality of life is dramatically affected by how much you have moved and what you have put in your mouth over your lifetime.</p> 
           <p>If you have any question about how important healthy eating can be, take time to view documentary movies like âForks Over Knivesâ or âEating You Alive.â Iâm not necessarily advocating that extreme a diet, but these films will get you thinking.</p> 
           <p><strong><a href="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/fad-diets-2/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2374" src="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fad-diets-283x300.jpg" alt="fad diets" width="283" height="300" srcset="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fad-diets-283x300.jpg 283w, https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fad-diets.jpg 337w" sizes="(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px"></a>#3: Avoid the Fads:</strong> Once you have decided to adopt a healthier lifestyle, the hardest part is deciding which changes you should make. You will need to practice a lot of due diligence. There is a lot of hype and misinformation out there. There is a new fad every week. First, itâs low fat. Then itâs low carb. Then itâs no bananas before noon on Thursdays (Iâm joking here, but you get the point. Some of the diets are just plain weird).</p> 
           <p>Most of those diet recommendations sound plausible. They all have their advocates who are only too happy to offer their testimonials. My advice: If it sounds too good to be true, avoid it. If they tell you the medical profession is trying to keep their diet a secret, avoid it. The consensus advice of the medical and nutrition communities may seem boring, but it is generally based on dozens of clinical studies. It is much more likely to be true than advice from your friends, your trainer, or that blogger who values controversy more than accuracy.</p> 
           <p><strong>#4: We Are All Different:</strong> Health recommendations are usually based on dozens of clinical studies. But, here is the secret that only scientists know. Clinical studies report averages, but none of us are average. Let me give you an example. Letâs say you wanted to do a clinical study to evaluate whether a low-carb diet helps people lose weight. You might enroll several hundred people in your study. If you put them all on an identical low-carb diet for 8 weeks, some of them would lose weight. Others would gain weight. At the end of the 8 weeks, you would average all weight changes together and report the average weight loss.</p> 
           <p>For the sake of argument, letâs say the average weight loss was 6.4 pounds. Thatâs fine except that not a single person in the study lost exactly 6.4 pounds, and some may have even gained weight. The bottom line is that your results may be different from conventional wisdom. Your results may be different from your friendâs. You will need to find out what works best for you.</p> 
           <p><strong>#5: You Donât Have To Change All At Once:</strong> Some people have an iron will and can make drastic changes overnight. Most of us arenât like that. If we try to change too many things at once, we become overwhelmed. We become discouraged. Sometimes we quit. Think of this as a marathon, not a sprint. Make âChange Oneâ your slogan. Change one thing each week until you are where you want to be. One week it may be replacing sugary desserts with fruits. Another week it may be adding a green vegetable to your dinner plate. Over time, all those small changes will result in a totally different lifestyle.</p> 
           <p><strong><a href="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/processed-foods/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2377" src="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/processed-foods-300x185.jpg" alt="processed foods" width="300" height="185" srcset="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/processed-foods-300x185.jpg 300w, https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/processed-foods.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>#6: Your Tastes Will Change:</strong> The first time you choose a low sodium food, it will taste bland. Over time you will come to enjoy the subtle flavors of the food and will come to dislike added salt. The first time you switch from whole milk to low fat milk it will taste like water. Over time you will learn to appreciate low fat milk, and whole milk will taste greasy. I could give lots more examples, but you get the point.</p> 
           <p><strong>#7: Processed Foods, Sweets, and Sodas Will Kill You:</strong> Iâm being dramatic here, but they are bad for your health. They have no place as part of a healthy diet. <a href="http://www.swedish.org/blog/2017/06/why-you-should-replace-processed-food-with-whole-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replace the processed foods and sweets with whole foods.</a> Replace the sodas with water or herbal teas.</p> 
           <p><strong>#8: Itâs What You Do Every Day That Matters:</strong> Refined grains, pastries and sweets should be only an occasional indulgence. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains should be the mainstay of your everyday diet. Eat a plant-based diet as much as possible.</p> 
           <p><strong>#9: Protein Is Important, Especially As We Get Older:</strong> Low fat or vegetarian protein sources should be your first choice. Chicken (with the skin removed) and fish are the healthiest meats. Nuts, beans &amp; seeds are excellent vegetarian protein sources, especially in combination. Think of red meats as no more than an occasional indulgence.</p> 
           <p><strong>#10: Avoid The Center Of The Supermarket:</strong> This is my only shopping advice. In general, supermarkets are arranged with real foods around the edges and the processed foods in the middle.</p> 
           <p><strong><a href="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/organic-foods/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2376" src="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/organic-foods-300x200.jpg" alt="organic foods" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/organic-foods-300x200.jpg 300w, https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/organic-foods.jpg 424w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>#11: Choose Organic:</strong> Our planet has become so polluted that is has become impossible to completely avoid toxic chemicals in our environment. They are in our air, our water, our soil, and our homes. Our only defense is to be informed consumers and avoid them whenever possible. If the cost of organic produce is an issue for you, be selective. There is a Dirty Dozen&nbsp; <a href="http://www.organic.org/articles/showarticle/article-214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of fruits and vegetables that are the ones most likely to be contaminated with pesticides and herbicides</a>.</p> 
           <p><strong>#12: Get Lots Of Exercise:</strong> Most experts recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise 5 times per week. More is even better. For best results choose a combination of aerobic and weight bearing exercise.</p> 
           <p><strong>#13: Control Your Weight:</strong> We are in the midst of an obesity epidemic. The problem is that 80% of us are genetically predisposed to become obese if we eat a typical American diet and follow a typical American lifestyle. The solution isnât the fad diet du jour. The solution is to change our diet and our lifestyle. For most of us, the changes I have outlined above will allow you to gradually attain &amp; maintain your ideal weight.</p> 
           <p><strong>#14: Supplementation Plays A Role:</strong> Supplementation is not a magic bullet, but it is an important component of a holistic wellness program. Some of us need supplementation to fill in nutritional gaps in our diet. Some of us need supplementation because of increased needs, either because of disease or genetics. Some of us choose supplementation to achieve optimal health.</p> 
           <p><strong>#15: Enjoy The Journey:</strong> If you think of a healthy lifestyle as depriving you of the things you enjoy, you will avoid it. Instead, think of it as an adventure. Have fun exploring new fruits and vegetables. Try cooking with herbs and spices. Seek out restaurants and recipes that turn healthy foods into a gourmet experience. Find exercises that you actually enjoy.&nbsp; Now you know how to live a healthy lifestyle and for longer.<strong><br> </strong></p> 
           <p><strong>What Does This Mean For You?</strong></p> 
           <p>This was not meant to be a diet book. Because each of us is different, I have shared 15 tips rather than a rigid diet plan that everyone should follow. However, I suspect many of you are scratching your heads and saying: âWhere do I go from here?â. For those of you who would like more specific recommendations for your new, healthier lifestyle, I recommend my recent article â<a href="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/best-diet-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Is The Best Diet For You</a>?â.</p>

             <p style="text-align: center; color: #444; font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 600;">Author: Dr. Stephen Chaney</p> 
             <p><a href="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/autism/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2543" src="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/autism.jpg" alt="autism" width="254" height="254" srcset="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/autism.jpg 254w, https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/autism-150x150.jpg 150w, https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/autism-50x50.jpg 50w, https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/autism-200x200.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px"></a>There is no question autism rates are skyrocketing. The prevalence of autism in young children has increased 2-fold since 2000, 4-fold since 1996, and as much as 13-fold since 1980. A large part of that increase is simply due to changes in the diagnostic criteria for autism, but there are probably biological and environmental factors involved as well.</p> 
             <p>The increase in autism has been blamed on vaccinations, cell phones, and GMO foods, but those theories have largely been debunked (Iâm not sure anyone really believed that cell phone use by the parents could cause autism in their children).</p> 
             <p><strong>Does folic acid during pregnancy reduce autism risk from pesticide exposure?</strong></p> 
             <p>The recent claim that glyphosate exposure may cause autism has proven to be controversial, but that is just the âtip of the iceberg.â&nbsp; Numerous recent studies have suggested that pesticide exposure during conception and pregnancy may increase the risk of autism in the children. This is at least a plausible hypothesis. Most pesticides are neurotoxins, and animal studies have shown that pesticide exposure during conception and pregnancy can affect neurological development in the offspring.</p> 
             <p>This is a âbad news â good newsâ situation. The bad news is we live in an increasingly polluted world and some exposure to pesticides is inevitable. We can reduce pesticide exposure in the food we eat by choosing organic, but even <a href="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/organic-foods-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organically-grown produce contains some pesticides</a> . Even worse, a recent study found 217 <a href="http://www.ewg.org/research/body-burden-pollution-newborns#.Wchu48iGPRY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neurotoxic chemicals in the umbilical cord blood of newborn babies</a>.</p> 
             <p>The good news is optimal nutrition during conception and pregnancy may reduce the risk of autism. In a previous study (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21610500)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R.J. Schmidt et al, Epidemiology, 22: 476-485, 2011</a>&nbsp;q), the authors showed that for mothers with a MTHFR gene defect, a prenatal supplement providing 400 ug of folic acid per day was associated with a 4.5-fold decreased risk of giving birth to a child with autism. That lead them to ask whether optimum folic acid status could reduce the effect of pesticides on autism risk.</p> 
             <p>[Note: I am not sharing this study with you because it is definitive. It is not. Further studies will be required to confirm these results. I am sharing it with you because, if true, it has some important implications that are not usually discussed in the scientific or popular literature.]</p> 
             <p><strong>How Was The Study Designed?</strong></p>

Schmidt et al, Environmental Health Perspectives, doi: 10.1289/EHP604</a>) is what is known as a case control study. The mothers in the study were part of the Childhood Autism Risks From Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) study. The children in the study were clinically confirmed to have ASD (autism spectrum disorders). The investigators chose 296 families from the CHARGE group for whom maternal folic acid intake and pesticide exposures were known. They compared them to 220 controls that did not have ASD and were matched by age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.</p> 
             <p>They assessed household pesticide exposure (pet flea &amp; tick products, indoor pesticides, and outdoor sprays or foggers) through telephone interviews. They also used telephone interviews to estimate total folic acid intake from multivitamins, prenatal vitamins and vitamin fortified foods. They assessed agricultural pesticide exposure based on proximity to areas of heavy agricultural pesticide use.</p> 
             <p>They considered the autism risk of women who were taking 800 ug of folic acid and had no known exposure to pesticides as the baseline. Anything below 800 ug was consider low folic acid intake. Basically, they were looking at the effects of low folic acid intake and pesticide exposure on autism risk.</p>

             <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #339966;">Does Folic Acid During Pregnancy Reduce Autism Risk From Pesticide Exposure?</h2> 
             <p><a href="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/folic-acid-during-pregnancy-during-pesticide-exposure/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2540" src="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/folic-acid-during-pregnancy-during-pesticide-exposure-300x201.jpg" alt="folic acid during pregnancy during pesticide exposure" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/folic-acid-during-pregnancy-during-pesticide-exposure-300x201.jpg 300w, https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/folic-acid-during-pregnancy-during-pesticide-exposure.jpg 409w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>For women with low folic acid intake during conception and early pregnancy, pesticide exposure significantly increased autism risk. The breakdown was as follows;</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li>Exposure to any indoor pesticides increased autism risk 2.5-fold.</li> 
              <li>Exposure to pet flea &amp; tick pesticides increased autism risk 3.9-fold.</li> 
              <li>Exposure to indoor pesticide sprays &amp; foggers&nbsp; increased autism risk 2.6-fold.</li> 
              <li>Exposure to outdoor pesticide sprays &amp; foggers increased autism risk 4.1-fold</li> 
              <li>Exposure to agricultural pesticides increased autism risk 2.2-fold.</li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>In contrast, high (800 ug) intake of&nbsp; folic acid during pregnancy (early) and conception significantly decreased the effect of pesticide exposure on autism risk. The breakdown was as follows:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li>27% decrease in autism risk due to exposure to any indoor pesticides.</li> 
              <li>59% decrease in autism risk due to pet flea &amp; tick pesticide exposure.</li> 
              <li>32% decrease in autism risk due to indoor pesticide sprays &amp; foggers.</li> 
              <li>56% decrease in autism risk due to outdoor pesticide sprays &amp; foggers.</li> 
              <li>50% decrease in autism risk due to agricultural pesticide exposure.</li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>In short, this study suggests that pesticide exposure during pregnancy increases autism risk and 800 ug of folic acid during conception and early pregnancy substantially decreases the effect of pesticide exposure on autism risk.</p> 
             <p><strong>What Does This Study Mean For You?</strong></p> 
             <p><a href="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/pesticide-exposure/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2542" src="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pesticide-exposure-300x201.jpg" alt="pesticide exposure" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pesticide-exposure-300x201.jpg 300w, https://healthtipsfromtheprofessor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pesticide-exposure.jpg 359w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>If confirmed by subsequent research, this study has several significant implications that deserve serious consideration.</p> 
             <p><strong>#1:Pesticide exposure is ubiquitous</strong>. Nobody wants bugs in their house or on their garden plants, so we spray pesticides everywhere without giving it a second thought. We donât want to be bothered by mosquitoes so we use foggers on our outdoor areas and spray bug repellents on ourselves when we go outdoors. We want the perfect lawn so we hire someone to spray gallons of pesticides and herbicides on the lawn where we and our children will play. We have pesticides on our food and in our water. If we live in agricultural areas, we breath pesticides. Thatâs how we end up with 287 environmental toxins (217 of which are neurotoxins) in the umbilical cord blood of newborn babies.</p> 
             <p><strong>#2: Pesticide exposure is not innocuous</strong>. This study suggests pesticide exposure during pregnancy increases autism risk. Other studies suggest pesticide exposure increases the risk of ADHD, birth defects, cancer and much more. None of these studies is definitive by itself. The problem is that most pesticide exposure is at relatively low levels. In addition, nobody is pesticide free so it is difficult to find a good control population. It would require very large population studies to show conclusive effects, and those studies would be extremely expensive. However, when you see study after study suggesting that pesticide exposure may be harmful to our health, it may be time to take notice and ask whether all this pesticide use is essential.</p> 
             <p><strong>#3: Supplementation may help protect us from environmental toxins</strong>. This study suggests that folic acid during pregnancy helps protect against the autism risk from pesticide exposure. Other studies suggest supplementation helps protect against the bad effects of other environmental toxins. We talk about the need of supplementation to fill the nutritional gaps of our bad diets. We talk about how supplementation can help meet the increased needs associated with disease, biological stress and genetic defects. However, we seldom talk about the need for supplementation to help protect us from environmental toxins in our increasingly polluted world.</p> 
             <p><strong>#4: Flea &amp; tick pesticides for your pets are among the worst offenders</strong>. If you are a woman who is pregnant or of childbearing age, have your husband or veterinarian handle the flea &amp; tick medicine. You donât want to be touching the stuff.</p> 
             <p><strong>#5: Once again, folic acid was sufficient to do the job, even in women with MTHFR deficiency</strong>.</p> 
             <p>&nbsp;</p> 
             <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #3366ff;">The Bottom Line</h3> 
             <p>&nbsp;</p> 
             <p>A recent study suggests that pesticide exposure during pregnancy increases autism risk, and that supplementation with 800 ug of folic acid during conception and early pregnancy substantially decreases the effect of pesticide exposure on autism risk.</p> 
             <p>There are several important implications of this research.</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li>Pesticide exposure is ubiquitous. Thatâs how we end up with 287 environmental toxins (217 of which are neurotoxins) in the umbilical cord blood of newborn babies.</li> 
              <li>Pesticide exposure is not innocuous. This study suggests that pesticide exposure during pregnancy significantly increases autism risk in newborns. Other studies suggest pesticide exposure increases the risk of ADHD, birth defects, cancer, and much more. Perhaps it is time to seriously consider decreasing pesticide usage.</li> 
              <li>Flea &amp; tick medicines for your pets are among the worst offenders. If you are a woman who is pregnant or of childbearing age, have your husband or veterinarian handle the flea &amp; tick medicine. You donât want to be touching the stuff.</li> 
              <li>Supplementation can help protect us from environmental toxins. This study suggests folic acid can help protect pregnant women against the autism risk from pesticide exposure during pregnancy. Other studies suggest supplementation helps protect against the bad effects of other environmental toxins. We donât give enough consideration to the need for supplementation to help protect us from environmental toxins in our increasingly polluted world.</li> 
              <li>Once again, folic acid was sufficient to do the job, even in women with MTHFR deficiency.</li> 
             </ul>
