         <ul> 
          <li>Eating disorders are serious conditions that often require medical and psychological intervention.&nbsp; Such conditions include binge eating disorder, compulsive eating, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia nervosa.</li> 
          <li>These can be life-threatening conditions. The sooner treatment begins, the better.</li> 
          <li>For information about eating disorder treatment for you or someone you care about, see <a href="http://www.uhs.umich.edu/eatingdisorders" target="_blank">Resources for Eating Disorders and Body Image</a>. </li>

     <p>A healthy diet is a big part of any successful self-care plan. Nutrition has been linked with emotional, physical, and cognitive health.&nbsp; Eating a healthy diet gives your brain and your body the vitamins and minerals needed to stay well.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, healthy eating habits can be difficult to maintain, especially if you have a mental health disorder. You&#x2019;re not alone if you find yourself experiencing changes in your appetite as a result of your disorder, or find yourself gaining weight as a side effect of your psychiatric medication.&nbsp; Make sure you discuss concerns about medication side effects or significant appetite changes with your healthcare provider. </p> 
     <p><strong>Your diet affects</strong>:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>the brain neurochemistry that controls mood and response to stress</li> 
      <li>the way your brain and body interact </li> 
      <li>the higher brain functions that control learning, memory and intellectual functioning</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>Whether deciding what, when or how much to eat, the key is <em>balance</em>.&nbsp; The strategies and tools outlined here will help you develop a more balanced approach to eating, and to incorporate some specific ideas that may lessen your mental health symptoms.&nbsp; </p> 
     <p><strong>What am I eating now?</strong><br> Making changes to how you eat is simple, but not easy.&nbsp; Breaking bad habits and establishing new, healthy routines always requires patience. And because eating has both a physical and emotional component (providing comfort, familiarity, and even recreation), developing an achievable eating plan may be a particularly challenging part of your self-care plan.</p> 
     <p>To make a start, it&#x2019;s good to first have a clear, honest picture of what you&#x2019;re currently eating. The best way to see how you&#x2019;re using food is to keep a <a href="../../downloads/DailyFoodDiary.pdf" target="_blank">food diary</a> for one week, writing down what, when, and how much you&#x2019;re eating. By also noting how you&#x2019;re feeling at different points during the day in your food diary, you&#x2019;ll get an even more complete picture of how your emotions and your eating behaviors may be interacting. See <a href="https://www.supertracker.usda.gov/">SuperTracker.usda.gov</a> to complete an online food diary.</p> 
     <p><strong>What should my food plan look like?</strong><br> The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently moved away from the traditional &#x201c;food pyramid&#x201d; in favor of a new icon, called MyPlate. The MyPlate icon is easy to understand and it helps to promote healthy food choices based on the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. </p> 
     <ul type="disc"> 
      <li>The United States Department of Agriculture&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/" target="_blank">ChooseMyPlate website</a> offers personalized eating plans and interactive tools to help you plan and assess your food choices based on American Dietary Guidelines.</li> 
      <li><a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/food-pyramid/about.htm" target="_blank">The U-M Healing Foods Pyramid</a> reflects the University&#x2019;s latest thinking about the connection between what we eat and how we feel. </li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><strong>Tips for Healthy Eating </strong><br> If you have a medical condition such as diabetes or food allergies, or other dietary restrictions including those related to taking certain psychiatric medications, you should follow your healthcare provider&#x2019;s specific dietary recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
     <p><strong>Eat small and frequent meals.</strong> Small and frequent meals can help prevent you from getting too hungry, which can lead to overeating. This approach also feeds your brain a steady supply of glucose which helps to keep cravings at a minimum.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
     <p><strong>Keep a regular meal schedule. </strong>&nbsp;Eating on a regular schedule can also help prevent you from getting too hungry, help you to plan for healthier meals, and help you get a good nightÂ’s sleep.&nbsp; Here are some tips for developing a regular eating schedule:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Schedule your classes so that you allow yourself enough time each day to have lunch and dinner.&nbsp; Rushing between classes can often lead to unhealthy eating options and habits. </li> 
      <li>If you are working a long day, make sure you take your lunch or dinner break regardless of how busy you are. You are entitled to these breaks.&nbsp; Breaks can also help relieve stress by giving you some downtime from the busy environment. </li> 
      <li>Keep some healthy and easy-to-grab food options on hand for days when you know you will not have time to take a break.&nbsp; This way you can bring the food with you wherever you need to go and can still eat at or near your regular eating time.&nbsp; To avoid spending a lot of money, invite your roommate/s to join in and split the costs with you.&nbsp; </li> 
      <li>Schedule a regular time to have dinner with your friends in the residence hall cafeteria. It always helps to have friends supporting these habits.&nbsp; </li> 
      <li>Take turns with your friends making inexpensive dinners at each other&#x2019;s apartments/houses one or two times per week.&nbsp; Students who have busy academic schedules, such as graduate students, may have difficulty finding time to see their friends. This is also a great way to have a set time to catch up with them.</li> 
      <li>Late dinners can&#x2019;t always be avoided. If you do go out to eat late at night, ask your server to wrap up half of your meal before you even get started.&nbsp; This can help to prevent overeating late at night which may affect your quality of sleep.</li> 
     </ul>

     <p><strong>Think ahead.</strong> Pack healthy snacks to avoid between-meal cravings. </p> 
     <p><strong>Don&#x2019;t skip breakfast. </strong>Skipping breakfast is associated with reduced problem solving ability, lower energy and decreased motivation.&nbsp; Eating breakfast may also help you to manage your hunger and food intake throughout the day.</p> 
     <p><strong>Consider taking a multivitamin*.</strong> A standard multivitamin can help ensure an adequate daily intake of vitamins and minerals that may improve mental health, including Vitamin 12 and Folic Acid.</p> 
     <p><em>*Make your healthcare provider aware of any dietary supplements you might be considering, as some have been shown to interact negatively with certain medications. </em></p> 
     <p><strong>Try to include Omega-3 fatty acids in your diet</strong>. Research suggests that Omega-3s play a role in many brain functions, from regulating mood to increasing cognitive abilities.&nbsp; Omega-3s can be found in fish including tuna and salmon, or in fish oil supplements.&nbsp; </p>

     <p><strong>Aim for variety, and let color guide you.</strong> Ideally, your daily menu should include a &#x201c;rainbow&#x201d; of fresh fruits and vegetables to ensure you&#x2019;re getting a balanced mix of nutrients. &nbsp;For example, eating plenty of leafy greens can help boost your intake of Folic Acid. &nbsp;Try to find a variety of different colored fruits and vegetables that you enjoy and work them into your diet.</p> 
     <p><strong>Remember that your beverage choices are as important as your food choices</strong>. </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Drinking plenty of water is recommended, to keep the body properly hydrated.</li> 
      <li>Limit caffeinated beverages like coffee, soda, or energy drinks, which can have a stimulating effect at first, only to be followed by a drop in energy level and mood.&nbsp; Here are some suggestions for energy boosting snacks that can be better alternatives: 
       <ul> 
        <li>Fresh fruits like bananas, apples, or berries</li> 
        <li>Yogurt with granola</li> 
        <li>Low-fat cheeses </li> 
        <li>Almonds and walnuts</li> 
        <li>Hummus and red peppers</li> 
        <li>Half of a sandwich</li> 
        <li>A single-serving of popcorn</li> 
       </ul> </li> 
      <li>Avoid alcohol which can act as a depressant and can interfere with your sleep patterns.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><strong>Know that all carbohydrates are not created equal.</strong> Processed sugars and refined carbohydrates provide only a temporary feeling of increased energy and fullness. That initial boost may be followed by a desire for more sweets and starches to prop up your mood and energy level.&nbsp; A better choice is complex carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables and healthy grains to ensure maximum nutritional and digestive benefits with fewer &#x201c;spikes&#x201d; that can disrupt brain chemistry.</p> 
     <p><strong>Limit fast food and junk food.</strong> Both high sugar and high fat meals can have a negative effect on mood. Use the list below for some ideas for snacks that taste good and also contain great nutrients to fuel your body:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><a href="/students/self_care/healthy_snacks.pdf"><strong>Snack Ideas for the Busy College Student</strong></a></li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><strong>Learn to listen to your body&#x2019;s signals to know when to eat, and when to stop</strong>.</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Eat when you feel physical hunger.</li> 
      <li>Try to eat slowly and mindfully.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>It takes several minutes for your body to signal fullness. &nbsp;Enjoy each bite and avoid overeating by stopping before you feel full.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><strong>Regulate your portion size.</strong>&nbsp; Many of us tend to underestimate the amount of food we eat and overestimate recommended portion sizes. Use the following tools for tips on regulating portion sizes:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><a href="http://www.hr.umich.edu/mhealthy/programs/nutrition/pdf/portion_size.pdf" target="_blank"><strong><u>MHealthy Nutrition Factsheet:&nbsp; Managing Your Portions</u></strong></a></li>

     </ul> 
     <p><strong>Don&#x2019;t give up everything you enjoy.</strong>&nbsp; Give yourself permission to indulge on occasion. Remember: everything in moderation.</p> 
     <p><strong>Pulling it all together</strong><br> Just as a food journal can help you assess your current eating habits, it can also help you to track your progress as you adopt a &#x201c;new&#x201d; nutrition plan. A food diary can even be expanded to include recording <a href="https://www.supertracker.usda.gov/" target="_blank">physical activity</a> and adherence to your medication plan, and to chart the emotions you experience during the day. All of this information gives you a clearer picture of how your self-care activities are working together to help you manage your mental health disorder. </p>
