So a student who gets an A in an AP course receives five grade points, rather than the usual four. A student who gets a B in an AP course gets four grade points, rather than three.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo you have some B\u2019s on your grade card, and still get above a 4.0 grade-point average,\u201d if a student is taking several AP courses, Tessler said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you see those GPAs that are 4.6 and higher, those students have taken AP courses in several core subjects,\u201d Tessler continued. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken the most rigorous course.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A glance at the grades for this year\u2019s graduating seniors illustrates this trend. DHS shared a GPA list \u2014 no names, just numbers \u2014 with The Enterprise. Of the 516 12<sup>th<\/sup>-grade students on the list, 127 students (nearly 25 percent) had a GPA of 4.0 or higher. The highest GPA on the list was above 4.8.<\/p>\n<p>There were 36 students with a GPA of 4.3 or higher. A student with a 3.90 GPA would rank 170<sup>th<\/sup> in the graduating class, well outside the top 10 percent. The average GPA is 3.46.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, DHS was one of 37 high schools in California that was honored by inclusion on the AP Achievement List, which is compiled by the College Board. The College Board noted that from 2008 to 2010, DHS increased the number of students in AP classes from 489 to 551, while improving the percentage of students earning qualifying scores on AP exams.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8216;Go after what you love, and the grades will follow&#8217;<\/h3>\n<p>Many students are tempted to take multiple AP courses as a means of boosting their grade-point averages. Many parents encourage their students to do this, or even push them to enroll in multiple AP courses, thinking that a higher GPA will help the student get into \u201cthe right college.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This strategy works for some, but not others. Some students thrive on AP courses, and enjoy the challenge. But others struggle. As the DHS website notes, an AP course \u201coften takes more time, requires more work, and goes into greater depth than other high school courses.\u201d Some students \u201cbite off more than they can chew,\u201d as the saying goes.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, DHS science department chair Wayne Raymond surveyed some of his students, and found that about two-thirds of them felt pressured to take AP or honors courses in order to compete; about half felt \u201cenormously pressured.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Raymond told The Enterprise in February that \u201cI have students who are really struggling and look shell-shocked.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>DHS Principal Jacqui Moore said sometimes \u201cour students stress themselves out by taking a lot of AP courses. They need to manage it in such a way that they\u2019re working on the quality of what they do. It\u2019s critical. I\u2019m worried about them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Moore suggested that as students enter high school and think about taking AP classes, \u201cyou might want to start with one AP class, and phase into it. Some students start right off the bat with three or four AP classes, and then find themselves stressed midway into the year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat you are learning should be the guiding factor in why kids take classes, not how much they are going to boost their grade-point average,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWhat we should be about is going after your passion. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve told my own children. Go after what you love, and the grades will follow. Don\u2019t go after the grades just because of the grades.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pamela Burnett, interim director of undergraduate admissions at the University of California Office of the President, said the UC system looks at the AP courses a student has taken, but considers other factors as well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCompletion of AP courses demonstrates that the students challenged themselves by taking the most rigorous courses available to them at their high school,&#8221; Burnett said. &#8220;This is considered a positive factor in the review process.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>She added that campuses consider the number of AP courses at each high school (according to the school\u2019s UC-approved \u201ca-g\u201d course list), whether the student took advantage of the opportunity to enroll in such courses and the number of AP courses completed. (The same applies to the number of UC-approved Honors or IB courses).<\/p>\n<p>In other words, students are not disadvantaged for not taking more AP courses if their school only offers a limited number, Burnett said.<\/p>\n<p>Last fall, UCD released an academic profile showing a typical high school GPA for incoming freshmen of between 3.85 and 4.21. For transfer students, many arriving from community colleges, the GPA range was 3.18 to 3.72.<\/p>\n<p>Tessler said parents need to remember that there are many other important factors in terms of college admission.<\/p>\n<h3>\u2018There is no number&#8217;<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cI just went to a breakfast meeting with representatives of Duke, Georgetown, Harvard, Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania,&#8221; Tessler aid. &#8220;And I asked them \u2018How many AP courses do you expect students to have taken when they apply?\u2019<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They said \u2018There is no number. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re looking for. We\u2019re looking for their contributions, and what their high school experience was like. We\u2019re looking for problem-solvers, people who could be leaders. We\u2019re looking for special talent.\u2019 \u201d<\/p>\n<p>Continued Tessler, \u201cThose schools aren\u2019t saying they\u2019re going to take a student because that student did one more AP class. It\u2019s about who you are, and what you are interested in.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So if you really have an interest in science, and you\u2019ve done classes, and an internship, and it\u2019s all connected, that is what you want to do. But if you just say \u2018I\u2019m doing this AP class because I\u2019ll get a high GPA,\u2019 they may not want you. This is the key point that people are missing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tessler said many DHS students do not score particularly well on the written essays that are typically part of a college application.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we look at some of our students\u2019 essays, what they\u2019re missing is passion,\u201d Tessler said. \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t know what to write about, because they\u2019re not passionate about anything. When you ask them what they\u2019re passionate about, they don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tessler acknowledged that most DHS seniors are keenly aware that a handful of their classmates have a GPA in the 4.4 to 4.8 range.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd for some of those (high GPA) students, it\u2019s easy,\u201d Tessler said. \u201cWe have some very, very talented, high-caliber kids. They are able to take these classes, they get through the homework quickly and excel, so that they can spend the majority of their time on things they are passionate about.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>\u2018They get stressed out, and get depressed&#8217;<\/h3>\n<p>But not all students can cope with a schedule that is top-heavy with AP courses.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c(Some of our students) try to match (the students with a very high GPA), thinking, \u2018If I take all these AP classes, I will somehow get into these big-name schools,\u2019 \u201d Tessler said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe problem is that these kids will be up to midnight, or 3 a.m., trying to keep up with the work. Then they get stressed out, and get depressed. Because that\u2019s not who they are.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We, as counselors, keep trying to say, \u2018Who are you? What are your interests? What can you handle? What are you interested in?\u2019 \u201d<\/p>\n<p>There have been situations where students have taken more AP courses than they could handle, found themselves unable to finish all the assignments, seen their grades dip, and become disqualified for freshman admission to a four-year college because of a low grade in a core subject.<\/p>\n<p>Tessler said students \u201cneed to stop comparing themselves to other kids, and parents really need to work with their own child, not comparing them to others, and help their child develop within their abilities, and at a pace they can handle.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Some students can handle one AP class, and that\u2019s it. You want your student to be well-balanced,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne other thing,\u201d the counselor added. \u201cYou want them to enjoy their three years at Davis High. They only get to be here once in their life. You only get to be this age once. They need to be able to socialize with friends, explore things, try different things. They need some time to just enjoy life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>\u2014 Reach Jeff Hudson at jhudson@davisenterprise.net or (530) 747-8055.<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"respond\" class=\"fb-comments\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.davisenterprise.com\/local-news\/our-sunday-best-ap-courses-can-boost-gpa-but-too-many-can-overload-a-student\/\" data-num-posts=\"5\" data-colorscheme=\"light\" data-width=\"100%\"><\/div><aside class=\"mashsb-container mashsb-main mashsb-stretched\"><div class=\"mashsb-box\"><div class=\"mashsb-count mash-large\" style=\"float:left;\"><div class=\"counts mashsbcount\">214<\/div><span class=\"mashsb-sharetext\">SHARES<\/span><\/div><div class=\"mashsb-buttons\"><a  class=\"mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.davisenterprise.com%2Flocal-news%2Four-sunday-best-ap-courses-can-boost-gpa-but-too-many-can-overload-a-student%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span class=\"icon\"><\/span><span class=\"text\">Share<\/span><\/a><a  class=\"mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=AP%20courses%20can%20boost%20GPA%2C%20but%20too%20many%20can%20overload%20a%20student&url=http:\/\/www.davisenterprise.com\/local-news\/our-sunday-best-ap-courses-can-boost-gpa-but-too-many-can-overload-a-student\/&via=alldenews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span class=\"icon\"><\/span><span class=\"text\">Tweet<\/span><\/a><div class=\"onoffswitch2 mash-large mashsb-noshadow\" style=\"display:none;\"><\/div><\/div>\r\n            <\/div>\r\n                <div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div><div class=\"mashsb-toggle-container\"><\/div><\/aside>\r\n            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.4.0-->","post_title":"AP courses can boost GPA, but too many can overload a student","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_name":"our-sunday-best-ap-courses-can-boost-gpa-but-too-many-can-overload-a-student","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2011-06-07 08:02:29","post_modified_gmt":"2011-06-07 15:02:29","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.davisenterprise.com\/?p=51250","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"25","filter":"raw","post_comments":[{"comment_ID":"463297","comment_post_ID":"51250","comment_author":"yamel","comment_author_email":"yamelbreiter@gmail.com","comment_author_url":"","comment_author_IP":"173.245.50.118","comment_date":"2015-01-17 11:28:44","comment_date_gmt":"2015-01-17 19:28:44","comment_content":"I just received a recognition letter from Harvard University,I was extremely happy than I read that to receive my award and attend the ceremony my GPA or rank had to be minimum 3.5.

It is: \"the fact or power of sharing the feelings of another, especially in sorrow or trouble; fellow feeling, compassion, or commiseration.\"","comment_karma":"0","comment_approved":"1","comment_agent":"Mozilla\/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident\/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)","comment_type":"","comment_parent":"22296","user_id":"27967","comment_subscribe":"Y"},{"comment_ID":"22296","comment_post_ID":"51250","comment_author":"I Disagree","comment_author_email":"idisagree@gmail.com","comment_author_url":"","comment_author_IP":"71.140.0.94","comment_date":"2011-06-11 18:09:33","comment_date_gmt":"2011-06-12 01:09:33","comment_content":"Sorry, but I think that, as the article says, top colleges don't really look at GPA; they look at other skills, other aspects of a student's persona.

AP Art History, AP English, and AP US History all involve a lot of writing.  These courses provide exactly the sort of preparation, with high standards, that you might need to write a college essay.  It is just not possible to survive in these courses without good reading and writing skills.  And the same goes for AP Statistics and AP Calculus, and basic math skills.  In fact, one reason that these AP courses are so popular is that many of the non-AP courses don't teach the basics as well as they should.  Calculus is partly used as a standard to guarantee that students have truly mastered high-school algebra.  If you know how to listen to a calculus teacher, then maybe the calculus itself won't stick, but you have probably learned algebra really well.\r\n\r\nNo, the problem faced by 4+ GPA students is not how to write a \"simple\" college essay, it's how to write a really good college essay.  To get into competitive universities, it's better to have an application that's good on all sides, or an application that's good in some way beyond any standard formula.  That is when the uncreative approach of \"whoever has the highest GPA, wins\" no longer works very well, even for the narrow goal of getting into the best college.","comment_karma":"0","comment_approved":"1","comment_agent":"Mozilla\/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.17) Gecko\/20110422 Ubuntu\/8.04 (hardy) Firefox\/3.6.17","comment_type":"","comment_parent":"0","user_id":"0","comment_subscribe":"N"},{"comment_ID":"21743","comment_post_ID":"51250","comment_author":"wdf1","comment_author_email":"hsjackson@aol.com","comment_author_url":"","comment_author_IP":"209.218.108.50","comment_date":"2011-06-05 00:40:32","comment_date_gmt":"2011-06-05 07:40:32","comment_content":"I don't know what GPA's the authors had, but I read some DHS student essays recently, and I was impressed.","comment_karma":"0","comment_approved":"1","comment_agent":"Mozilla\/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident\/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; MDDC; .NET4.0C)","comment_type":"","comment_parent":"21739","user_id":"0","comment_subscribe":"N"},{"comment_ID":"21739","comment_post_ID":"51250","comment_author":"Al","comment_author_email":"aharjala@yahoo.com","comment_author_url":"","comment_author_IP":"67.166.145.194","comment_date":"2011-06-04 23:00:47","comment_date_gmt":"2011-06-05 06:00:47","comment_content":"I am concerned that students graduating from DHS with GPAs above 4.0 are unable to write a simple college application essay at the same time the school offers, and encourages students to take, these AP courses in subjects like art history, music theory, and statistics.

On the whole, I think that the AP offerings at DHS are really great, and I would not want the high school to scale them back.  Moreover, many of our favorite teachers at DHS are AP teachers.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, if there is one thing to change, it is the amount of work that some --- but not all --- of the AP courses require.  There is something of an all-or-nothing pattern to the courses at the high school.  Many of the non-AP courses have relatively little homework, while many of the AP classes really have a lot of work, in some cases more work than similar courses at UC Davis.  I understand that the AP curriculum is not easy material, which is part of what makes it valuable.  However, in education, it is easy to confuse LONG with DIFFICULT.  Just because the AP material can be difficult, that does not mean that the class should grind it into the students with extremely long assignments.\r\n\r\nPart of what is going, I think, is that it natural for an AP teacher to feel responsible for the AP scores at the end of the year.  But it's wrong to turn this into a big contest, as if the teacher with the most AP 5's in his class, wins.  Of course, students deserve adequate preparation for the AP exam.  But adequate preparation is not the same as guaranteed preparation, which in any case is hardly possible for the whole class.","comment_karma":"0","comment_approved":"1","comment_agent":"Mozilla\/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.17) Gecko\/20110422 Ubuntu\/8.04 (hardy) Firefox\/3.6.17","comment_type":"","comment_parent":"0","user_id":"0","comment_subscribe":"N"},{"comment_ID":"21706","comment_post_ID":"51250","comment_author":"AP tests","comment_author_email":"k_glatter@yahoo.com","comment_author_url":"","comment_author_IP":"75.48.2.208","comment_date":"2011-06-04 09:58:23","comment_date_gmt":"2011-06-04 16:58:23","comment_content":"It's great that Davis High has so many AP classes.

AP Art History, AP English, and AP US History all involve a lot of writing.  These courses provide exactly the sort of preparation, with high standards, that you might need to write a college essay.  It is just not possible to survive in these courses without good reading and writing skills.  And the same goes for AP Statistics and AP Calculus, and basic math skills.  In fact, one reason that these AP courses are so popular is that many of the non-AP courses don't teach the basics as well as they should.  Calculus is partly used as a standard to guarantee that students have truly mastered high-school algebra.  If you know how to listen to a calculus teacher, then maybe the calculus itself won't stick, but you have probably learned algebra really well.\r\n\r\nNo, the problem faced by 4+ GPA students is not how to write a \"simple\" college essay, it's how to write a really good college essay.  To get into competitive universities, it's better to have an application that's good on all sides, or an application that's good in some way beyond any standard formula.

On the whole, I think that the AP offerings at DHS are really great, and I would not want the high school to scale them back.  Moreover, many of our favorite teachers at DHS are AP teachers.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, if there is one thing to change, it is the amount of work that some --- but not all --- of the AP courses require.  There is something of an all-or-nothing pattern to the courses at the high school.  Many of the non-AP courses have relatively little homework, while many of the AP classes really have a lot of work, in some cases more work than similar courses at UC Davis.  I understand that the AP curriculum is not easy material, which is part of what makes it valuable.  However, in education, it is easy to confuse LONG with DIFFICULT.  Just because the AP material can be difficult, that does not mean that the class should grind it into the students with extremely long assignments.\r\n\r\nPart of what is going, I think, is that it natural for an AP teacher to feel responsible for the AP scores at the end of the year.  But it's wrong to turn this into a big contest, as if the teacher with the most AP 5's in his class, wins.  Of course, students deserve adequate preparation for the AP exam.  But adequate preparation is not the same as guaranteed preparation, which in any case is hardly possible for the whole class.","comment_karma":"0","comment_approved":"1","comment_agent":"Mozilla\/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.17) Gecko\/20110422 Ubuntu\/8.04 (hardy) Firefox\/3.6.17","comment_type":"","comment_parent":"0","user_id":"0","comment_subscribe":"N"},{"comment_ID":"21706","comment_post_ID":"51250","comment_author":"AP tests","comment_author_email":"k_glatter@yahoo.com","comment_author_url":"","comment_author_IP":"75.48.2.208","comment_date":"2011-06-04 09:58:23","comment_date_gmt":"2011-06-04 16:58:23","comment_content":"It's great that Davis High has so many AP classes.  I would really encourage students to take these classes- it gives you a taste of what college will be like, and could lead to receiving actual college credit.\r\n  Everyone is stressed out right now.  Unemployment is hovering close to 10%.  Many new college grads can't find a job.  Those of us with jobs feel insecure.  High school students should avail themselves of this free opportunity to get a great education.\r\n Unfortunately, high school isn't just about socializing with friends.  It's a very competitive global economy; the USA is behind most countries in science, math, reading, etc.  High school students should work hard like the rest of us and take these difficult classes.","comment_karma":"0","comment_approved":"1","comment_agent":"Mozilla\/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident\/4.0; GTB7.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; MDDC; .NET4.0C)","comment_type":"","comment_parent":"0","user_id":"0","comment_subscribe":"N"}];

       </blockquote> 
       <p>At Davis High School, the wide array of Advanced Placement courses available to students is both a point of pride and a matter of concern.</p> 
       <p>The AP courses offer students an opportunity to do college-level work while in high school, and satisfy some requirements for a college degree.</p> 
       <p>Because AP courses come with “weighted” grades, many students who take multiple AP courses can boost their grade-point averages.</p> 
       <p>“You get an extra grade point if you take an AP class or an Honors class,” explained DHS head counselor Courtenay Tessler. So a student who gets an A in an AP course receives five grade points, rather than the usual four. A student who gets a B in an AP course gets four grade points, rather than three.</p> 
       <p>“So you have some B’s on your grade card, and still get above a 4.0 grade-point average,” if a student is taking several AP courses, Tessler said.</p> 
       <p>“When you see those GPAs that are 4.6 and higher, those students have taken AP courses in several core subjects,” Tessler continued. “They’ve taken the most rigorous course.”</p> 
       <p>A glance at the grades for this year’s graduating seniors illustrates this trend. DHS shared a GPA list — no names, just numbers — with The Enterprise. Of the 516 12<sup>th</sup>-grade students on the list, 127 students (nearly 25 percent) had a GPA of 4.0 or higher. The highest GPA on the list was above 4.8.</p> 
       <p>There were 36 students with a GPA of 4.3 or higher. A student with a 3.90 GPA would rank 170<sup>th</sup> in the graduating class, well outside the top 10 percent. The average GPA is 3.46.</p> 
       <p>Earlier this year, DHS was one of 37 high schools in California that was honored by inclusion on the AP Achievement List, which is compiled by the College Board. The College Board noted that from 2008 to 2010, DHS increased the number of students in AP classes from 489 to 551, while improving the percentage of students earning qualifying scores on AP exams.</p> 
       <h3>‘Go after what you love, and the grades will follow’</h3> 
       <p>Many students are tempted to take multiple AP courses as a means of boosting their grade-point averages. Many parents encourage their students to do this, or even push them to enroll in multiple AP courses, thinking that a higher GPA will help the student get into “the right college.”</p> 
       <p>This strategy works for some, but not others. Some students thrive on AP courses, and enjoy the challenge. But others struggle. As the DHS website notes, an AP course “often takes more time, requires more work, and goes into greater depth than other high school courses.” Some students “bite off more than they can chew,” as the saying goes.</p> 
       <p>Earlier this year, DHS science department chair Wayne Raymond surveyed some of his students, and found that about two-thirds of them felt pressured to take AP or honors courses in order to compete; about half felt “enormously pressured.”</p> 
       <p>Raymond told The Enterprise in February that “I have students who are really struggling and look shell-shocked.”</p> 
       <p>DHS Principal Jacqui Moore said sometimes “our students stress themselves out by taking a lot of AP courses. They need to manage it in such a way that they’re working on the quality of what they do. It’s critical. I’m worried about them.”</p> 
       <p>Moore suggested that as students enter high school and think about taking AP classes, “you might want to start with one AP class, and phase into it. Some students start right off the bat with three or four AP classes, and then find themselves stressed midway into the year.</p> 
       <p>“What you are learning should be the guiding factor in why kids take classes, not how much they are going to boost their grade-point average,” Moore said. “What we should be about is going after your passion. That’s what I’ve told my own children. Go after what you love, and the grades will follow. Don’t go after the grades just because of the grades.”</p> 
       <p>Pamela Burnett, interim director of undergraduate admissions at the University of California Office of the President, said the UC system looks at the AP courses a student has taken, but considers other factors as well.</p> 
       <p>“Completion of AP courses demonstrates that the students challenged themselves by taking the most rigorous courses available to them at their high school,” Burnett said. “This is considered a positive factor in the review process.”</p> 
       <p>She added that campuses consider the number of AP courses at each high school (according to the school’s UC-approved “a-g” course list), whether the student took advantage of the opportunity to enroll in such courses and the number of AP courses completed. (The same applies to the number of UC-approved Honors or IB courses).</p> 
       <p>In other words, students are not disadvantaged for not taking more AP courses if their school only offers a limited number, Burnett said.</p> 
       <p>Last fall, UCD released an academic profile showing a typical high school GPA for incoming freshmen of between 3.85 and 4.21. For transfer students, many arriving from community colleges, the GPA range was 3.18 to 3.72.</p> 
       <p>Tessler said parents need to remember that there are many other important factors in terms of college admission.</p> 
       <h3>‘There is no number’</h3> 
       <p>“I just went to a breakfast meeting with representatives of Duke, Georgetown, Harvard, Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania,” Tessler aid. “And I asked them ‘How many AP courses do you expect students to have taken when they apply?’</p> 
       <p>“They said ‘There is no number. That’s not what we’re looking for. We’re looking for their contributions, and what their high school experience was like. We’re looking for problem-solvers, people who could be leaders. We’re looking for special talent.’ ”</p> 
       <p>Continued Tessler, “Those schools aren’t saying they’re going to take a student because that student did one more AP class. It’s about who you are, and what you are interested in.</p> 
       <p>“So if you really have an interest in science, and you’ve done classes, and an internship, and it’s all connected, that is what you want to do. But if you just say ‘I’m doing this AP class because I’ll get a high GPA,’ they may not want you. This is the key point that people are missing.”</p> 
       <p>Tessler said many DHS students do not score particularly well on the written essays that are typically part of a college application.</p> 
       <p>“When we look at some of our students’ essays, what they’re missing is passion,” Tessler said. “Sometimes they don’t know what to write about, because they’re not passionate about anything. When you ask them what they’re passionate about, they don’t know what to say.”</p> 
       <p>Tessler acknowledged that most DHS seniors are keenly aware that a handful of their classmates have a GPA in the 4.4 to 4.8 range.</p> 
       <p>“And for some of those (high GPA) students, it’s easy,” Tessler said. “We have some very, very talented, high-caliber kids. They are able to take these classes, they get through the homework quickly and excel, so that they can spend the majority of their time on things they are passionate about.”</p> 
       <h3>‘They get stressed out, and get depressed’</h3> 
       <p>But not all students can cope with a schedule that is top-heavy with AP courses.</p> 
       <p>“(Some of our students) try to match (the students with a very high GPA), thinking, ‘If I take all these AP classes, I will somehow get into these big-name schools,’ ” Tessler said.</p> 
       <p>“The problem is that these kids will be up to midnight, or 3 a.m., trying to keep up with the work. Then they get stressed out, and get depressed. Because that’s not who they are.</p> 
       <p>“We, as counselors, keep trying to say, ‘Who are you? What are your interests? What can you handle? What are you interested in?’ ”</p> 
       <p>There have been situations where students have taken more AP courses than they could handle, found themselves unable to finish all the assignments, seen their grades dip, and become disqualified for freshman admission to a four-year college because of a low grade in a core subject.</p> 
       <p>Tessler said students “need to stop comparing themselves to other kids, and parents really need to work with their own child, not comparing them to others, and help their child develop within their abilities, and at a pace they can handle.”</p> 
       <p>“Some students can handle one AP class, and that’s it. You want your student to be well-balanced,” she said.</p> 
       <p>“One other thing,” the counselor added. “You want them to enjoy their three years at Davis High. They only get to be here once in their life. You only get to be this age once. They need to be able to socialize with friends, explore things, try different things. They need some time to just enjoy life.”</p>
