        <div class="p402_premium"> 
         <strong>Be self-motivated: grades can matter</strong>
         <br> No one has ever told me the most important part of college was grades. Frankly, I’d be scared to meet such a person.
         <p></p>
         <p>The college experience is so vast and enriching that grades are not always the most important thing. I knew people that were training for the Olympics. I knew other people that started businesses and were meeting with venture capitalists. I knew other people that devoted time to relationships–some of these couples are now married–and I’d say that this was probably a better use of time than grades given how happy they are.</p>
         <p>But I also know a lot of people who under-performed in class and regret it.</p>
         <p>Grades do matter for jobs, more than I would have thought. This is certainly true in government jobs, some of which have specific GPA requirements. One of my good friends had a 2.96 GPA that prevented him from getting a job with a 3.0 GPA minimum (the recruiter was not amused when he asked if they would “round up” his GPA).</p>
         <p>A lot of consulting and finance jobs have GPA requirements as well. When I applied, a top management consulting company had a 3.7 GPA cutoff for their first round interviews.</p>
         <p>Whether these standards are justifiable is something of a moot argument. They exist and companies believe they matter. The practical reality is grades can open doors at many top notch jobs, and you’d be better off getting good grades.</p>
         <p>But to get good grades you have to really want it. College is too full of distractions and other opportunities and no one is going to hold your hand. It’s important to be self-motivated so you can follow through on what needs to be done.</p>
         <p>Which brings me to my first tip.</p>
         <p><strong>Tip 1: Ask for model papers</strong><br> I could never tell what a teacher wanted in a writing-based class. I’ve turned in terrible papers that have gotten A’s. And I’ve also turned in highly polished, highly researched papers that have gotten a B minus–the teacher didn’t like my writing style.</p>
         <p>Rather than guessing what they wanted, I eventually learned ways to learn what they wanted.</p>
         <p>The turning point for me was a freshman writing class. We were supposed to compare and contrast the morality lessons in two short-stories. A younger me would have just tackled the assignment the way I saw fit. But I realized it would be better to admit I didn’t know what I was doing.</p>
         <p>I realized I had never written anything like this. My high school English department was good. But we never had to write big essays comparing works. Our assignments were always literary criticism of one text at a time–the more you hyper-analyzed a work of Shakespeare, for instance, the better.</p>
         <p>So I just admitted this to the instructor. I told her I didn’t know what I was doing and I asked to see a model paper.</p>
         <p>We met a day later at the humanities department. She went to some old file cabinets and retrieved model papers from previous years. She photocopied a couple for me to take home.</p>
         <p>I read over these essays several times. I tried to emulate both the style and the structure of the papers. I paid particular attention to how the thesis was formed and how the authors cited textual evidence.</p>
         <p>I carried these lessons when writing my paper. I received an A grade and the teacher commented how well I did, saying I picked up the style and it seemed quite natural for me. And to my ultimate astonishment, she then asked if she could use my paper as a model!</p>
         <p>And I can honestly say I was surprised because I was not the best writer in the class. Not by a longshot. There were people who majored in English and History in my class.</p>
         <p>But I did well because I knew what the teacher expected in a paper. I was the only student to ask for examples of model papers.</p>
         <p><strong>Tip 2: Get old tests</strong><br> Just as a model paper can help you in a writing class, an old test can help you in a technical class.</p>
         <p>An old test can give you an idea of the structure of the exam and the types of questions that will be asked. While a professor is unlikely to ask the same exact questions, it does happen from time to time. This is especially true when the professor is a new person and is too lazy to write new exam questions. I always made sure I could solve these old exams cold.</p>
         <p>Some professors were nice enough to give us old tests. In this case, the strategy was slightly different. I was pretty sure the professor would not repeat the same exam material, so I focused a bit more on other topics. I still spent good time learning these questions–after all, what is more embarrassing than missing a question when the teacher gives it to you in advance!</p>
         <p>The biggest payoff is when you can get a copy the professor does not release to the class. It helps here to know people who just took the class (my friend’s business fraternity cataloged exams of popular classes). These questions are gold can you can try them in a mock exam setting.</p>
         <p><strong>Tip 3: Read other textbooks</strong><br> I never understood how professors picked textbooks. Some professors picked textbooks they owned. Others picked textbooks a previous professor used for consistency.</p>
         <p>The thing I learned is that textbooks were not always chosen because they were the best. It stunned me that in a college setting, where students shelled out so much money, the educational material could be sub-par.</p>
         <p>Some of your confusion could be your textbook! There were many times I was confused in economics and math courses about basic theorems and definitions. I tried my best to understand them from the book. But when that failed, I tried something else.</p>
         <p>I remember a time I was really confused in differential geometry. The book had defined something and it seemed very vague to me. The professor had only recycled the same examples in class so I was lost.</p>
         <p>I knew this was an important topic so I figured I had to learn it. I went to the math library and looked up books on differential geometry. There were two and I promptly looked up the same topic in them. Within minutes I came across a graphic and an example that made perfect sense to me. The resulting problem set was a breeze and I was very comfortable with the concept going forward.</p>
         <p>I admit I was lucky in finding the right books. But there were times I could not find alternate textbooks to explain things. And that’s when I tried the next tip.</p>
         <p><strong>Tip 4: Review course material from another university (or from another prof)</strong><br> If you can’t understand your professor, try someone else.</p>
         <p>There’s a decent chance your same class material is being taught at another university. It’s often possible to find that course material using Google searches and go through the lecture notes, the problems, and the discussions.</p>
         <p>I especially needed this during an advanced game theory course I took where the majority of the class was second year PhD students. The statistics were over my head and I was lost many times. I found course material for both the statistics and the game theory portions and pieced together the information.</p>
         <p>This tip works very well for introductory classes, like linear algebra and introductory physics as virtually every university offers these classes.</p>
         <p><strong>BORING stuff I did to get good grades</strong><br> While those four big tips helped give me the edge, they weren’t the only reason I got good grades. I did a lot of the basic things people talk about all the time. Here are a few of the mundane habits I kept.</p>
         <p><strong>Plenty of sleep</strong><br> I am a stickler about getting a full-night’s rest. This is a personal thing, though I have heard sleeping is important to learning. At a minimum it helped me stay relaxed and I was never irritable like those people on 4 hours sleep.</p>
         <p><strong>Studied 4-6 hours every day</strong><br> I studied most days. The routine for me was to study in the afternoons and just after dinner. I often studied from 3pm-6pm, took an hour from dinner, and then from 7pm-10pm. It would of course change when I had errands or wanted to play basketball, but it was generally a routine.</p>
         <p><strong>Scheduled in a daily planner</strong><br> I always wrote down midterms and finals from the start of the class. I always wanted to be prepared and it’s why I rarely did things at the last minute. Many times I would plan my days out hour-by-hour so I could have a plan and stay focused.</p>
         <p><strong>Went to office hours if needed</strong><br> I knew too many people who tried to figure things out by themselves. Learning isn’t just about sitting with a book and hacking away. It’s a dynamic process and discussion can often help. If I spent more than a day trying to figure something out, I’d go to to the professor or teaching assistant and ask for some pointers.</p>
         <p><strong>“Memorized class notes” and problems by final exam</strong><br> I figured course notes and material were a good guideline of the testing material. I made sure to have this material down pat. For math classes I made a list of theorems and definitions and got those down cold. Most of the test was variations on these concepts, so just knowing them gave me a huge advantage.</p>
         <p><strong>Self-explanatory tips</strong><br> These really should go without saying, but I of course did these things:</p>
         <ul>
          <li><strong>Went to tutors</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Picked professors and classes wisely</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Read the syllabus</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Completed course material </strong></li>
          <li><strong>Studied at the library</strong></li>
         </ul>
         <p><strong>Kept balance with exercise, other clubs, friends</strong><br> It’s easy to burn out on academics. I always made sure to schedule 2 or more hours in a day to free time with friends and/or exercise.</p>
         <p><strong>Tips I didn’t do</strong><br> There are a few commonly accepted tips I did not follow.</p>
         <p><strong>I never ate a traditional breakfast</strong><br> I usually just had a banana while heading to morning class. Since I didn’t spend much time on breakfast, I could wake up a bit later and personally I was happy with the sleep. Though I do know many people that swore by their morning meal, missing this did not ultimately affect my grades.</p>
         <p><strong>I skipped sections, and sometimes class</strong><br> There were some professors and teaching assistants that managed to confuse everyone. One of my statistics teacher showed a slide of a Venn Diagram with overlapping circles and claimed the events were “mutually exclusive.” When a student pointed out there was an intersecting area–the non-mutually exclusive part–the professor merely said “oh that’s a typo” and told the class to ignore it. What followed was the most confusing and convoluted example I’ve ever heard. Attendance in the class was optional and I never went again (I was one of the few that got an A+).</p>
         <p><strong>What are your tips?</strong><br> If you’re a good student I’m sure there are a lot of people who could benefit from your advice.</p>

           <p>One of the best classes I attended was an accounting class in a community college in Houston. The teacher was a no-nonsense tough pedant but a good one. He would give a quiz before and after the class. The quiz before the class started tested you on material that was taught in the last class and the quiz after the class tested you on material taught in the class. And quizzes were 20% of the grade. That forced me to study material from the previosu class, prep for the upcoming class and pay attention to the ongoing class.<br> I got an A and learnt Financial accounting!!</p>
           <p>Also, the question bank could be a grade differetiatior in a competitive class and on a graded curve, the students without the question bank could be behind. It is unfair but so is life. But preparation, undertstanding and learning should be able to knock out the question bank advantage.</p>

           <p>You’ve pretty much summarized advice I give students on succeeding.</p>
           <p>However, you’ve left out one possibility on why professors repeat some test questions — sometimes you come up with a particularly good question that you want to modify to use again &amp; again!</p>

           <p>If professors give example questions in class, you should make sure you can do all of those example questions in your sleep. They usually cover the basic concepts. Also, try to redo the homework questions you initially had trouble on.Then work on more questions from the textbook or past papers.</p>

           <p>Worked for me (in addition to the above):<br> – sleep at least 7 hours per night<br> – keep an exercise regimen<br> – work to find your best study habits and follow accordingly. Mine was to make an outline of class notes, or more often of the book’s contents, then copy the outline in full, twice. After writing it in hand myself (twice), I would finally remember it all.<br> – the above study habit works (for me) for memorization content, but for actual “problems” like the ones in physics, math, or engineering classes, the only thing is practice, and making sure you’re practicing on the right problem set (old tests, profs’ examples, homework)<br> – skip class if you think it’s necessary. I ended up teaching my physics classmates because I made the call to skip class and learn from the book. Unfortunately, the book often teaches better than the professor in core classes<br> – ask the prof if there is a better alternative text for the class. he/she will probably appreciate this, and you will end up with another book that may be better at explaining than the current text. Just make sure the prescribed class text wasn’t written by the prof instead!<br> – Presh…no mention of sucking up to the prof? That might be the best way, as long as you don’t screw it up and annoy the prof instead. It’s an art…but don’t underestimate its value.</p>

           <p>Very good article. You should write a follow up called “how to get a 3.6 without studying and/or reading the textbook” (I can help with this subject) because even moreso than what Presh did, THAT requires some serious strategic planning/thinking.</p>

           <p>I started University 3 semesters ago, right out of high school. I was very confident about college, because I had been an A/B student in HS without the need of studying much.<br> Using the same studying skills, or lack there of, I managed to fail 2 classes in my first semester. I holed myself away in shame, crawled out, and came back for my second semester and scrambled to figure out what it meant to study–and how to do it correctly. My improvement (grade-wise) has been slow … and my GPA is a disgustingly low 2.5 … but, at least I’m improving in each round.</p>
           <p>Any High school seniors out there reading this, don’t make my mistake. Learn study skills before going to college. High school does not correctly prepare you.</p>
           <p>Anyway, my study tips are as follows:</p>
           <p>1) When you do your required reading in the textbook, have a sheet of paper beside you, and take notes on what you feel will be important. Highlight terms and ideas.</p>
           <p>2) Stay one chapter ahead of your class. This is helpful, because you’re able to learn on your own via the textbook(s)–and when you finally go over the chapter in class you’ll be given a review.</p>
           <p>3) Make your own questions. Even questions you don’t necessarily know the answer to. Quiz yourself, challenge yourself. Really get yourself thinking about the subject. Even if it’s math, you can still make your own questions.</p>
           <p>4) Before going to bed each night, do a review of everything you studied during the day. I have a Journal that I write in every night–I write everything I learned for the day, in as much detail as I’m able. I write everything from memory: formulas, terms, definitions, etc …</p>
           <p>5) Use sticky notes and write terms, definitions, formulas, equations, etc … on them. Place them everywhere! On your fridge, walls, toilet seat–anywhere you can, so you’ll see them everyday, and read them everyday. NOTE: I’ve even put a sheet of paper inside water-protective covering and placed it in my shower. (If you live in a dorm, you can’t really do this. But if you have your own apartment, decorate your walls with sticky notes!)</p>
           <p>I hope my tips help someone! 🙂</p>

           <p>Make note cards of definitions, important facts, equations, questions, etc. Print out visuals to study if you are a visual learning. Re-read the book. Explain concepts to other people to make sure you know them well. Take notes of anything the teacher says that sounds important.</p>

           <p>1- having 7 hours sleep<br> 2- waking up early study for 30 min the most difficult subject , our minds absorb quickly right after u wake up .<br> 3- exercise exercise exercise , sothat you avoid sleepness , if u felt sleepy stand up walk read what you got to study while walking even if it should be solved just read it precisely realize how efficient you’ve shifted your sleeping desire momentum towards a strong commitment preceeded by rock solid determination and will power towards sticking to ur daily goals<br> 4- water water water , ur brain needs alot of water to function properly<br> 5- calm place to study , silence , plus laser focus concentration on the subject at hand . personally i study at the library more hours than at home , sometimes i wish the library wont close 😛 lol<br> 6- take break every 45 min , sothat u wont get bored<br> 7- if it is to do some push ups,abs ,or aerobic ex ,so go for it<br> 8- dont eat too much coz that would shift ur body’s energy focus on digestion rather than on concentration and studying<br> 9- visualization : visualize urself having finished all what u have to finish and how u would feel comfortable after that , how much info u have stored and how efficient your brain was working , visualization plays a great role<br> 10- finally as for me i give my self a gift after i finish my daily goals,that’s what i call pain pleasure zone, after that hard day it’s time to celebrate ! so i eat my favorite food , whether it was an apple or a choclate 😀<br> or it maybe running few miles<br> or it may be listenning to music<br> or it may be shopping<br> or it may be going on facebook<br> or it may be chilling out with my friends<br> or it may be sleeping an extra hour , i love sleeping 😀<br> or it may be YOGA<br> …………… etc , hope u liked them they’re simple and can be easily applied u need self-discipline, motivation, will power .<br> get inspired ,get informed ,and get going 😀</p>

           <p>I didn’t do great in college. I went to my state university (University in Delaware) and earned a 2.8 GPA. I don’t feel that I performed up to my potential, grade-wise. This did not ultimately hold me back, as I worked full time within my chosen industry beginning in my third year of college. I was able to supplement my school learning with industry-specific training and certifications, which allowed me to accelerate my career progress once I graduated.</p>
           <p>Was this a good or bad choice? Tough to say. Early on, I was pigeonholed into my specific industry niche. This was fine, as it has been a lucrative niche. After 15 years, I have become somewhat bored by this technology, but my early specialization has made it difficult to branch into other areas.</p>
           <p>If I could give advice to high-potential individuals (you know, they type that read this blog and the comments!), it is to carefully look at the ceiling of your chosen profession. Assuming the individual can reach the highest level of a range of professions, make sure you will be satisfied by bumping up against the ceiling of the one you ultimately choose. For a simple example, if the most successful economist can make $1+ million annually (think Krugman/Mankiw), and the most successful psychologist can only make $500,000, make sure you will be satisfied with $500k. (All figures in this example completely fabricated)</p>

           <p>Thanks for the insightful tips for success in college. I think there<br> are definitely some amazingly easy tips that can be easily overlooked such as<br> simply showing up for class, and especially keeping up with your<br> syllabus so that nothing catches you off guard, so you can plan<br> accordingly. “<a href="http://www.collegehaze.com/college-life/college-classes/how-to-get-an-a-in-college" rel="nofollow">How to get an A in College</a>” has some other beneficial tips.</p>

           <p>…Always try to study in<br> a particular place. Choose a suitable place for your study and prepare it so<br> that there is nothing around you which could turn your attention (like<br> magazines etc.)It would be better if you sit in your study table. Never lie<br> down anywhere while studying you are sure to go into sleep. Try to study in a<br> place where lot of light &amp; air could enter.</p>

           <p>Apologies for the late reply, don’t know how I missed this. The grading system had more refinements. We were awarded a 4.3 for an A+, a 4 for and A, a 3.7 for an A-, a 3.3 for a B+, and so on.<br> All of my B’s were a B+, some of my A’s were an A-, and some of them were an A+. It averaged out to a 3.97.</p>

           <p>I can tell you that it’s easier said than done. You need to pick a major that you are genuinely interested in and that matches your strengths. If you suck at Math and Science avoid those courses like the Plague! See if your university allows the Pass/Fail option. Outline the textbooks and read before class. Cramming for exams doesn’t work! Write papers in small chunks starting a week before it’s due. Go to your professors office hours because after all your tuition is funding their research/salary. Only take courses you can handle. Don’t procrastinate…even if it means neglecting your friends it’s not worth it. And don’t set lofty goals. If you can get a B+ in all your classes that’s still pretty good. And do take the GPA boosters some courses are just easy A’s! You need to d</p>

           <p>Cramming does not work, no matter how much of caffeine you take. Organic Chemistry,Calculus II, and Anatomy/Physiology are among the hardest college courses. Don’t do homework in your room, go to the library. Never let a day go by where you don’t do some work in your classes.</p>

           <p>I am in engineering so its different course wise. 90% of my classes are math based.</p>
           <p>My success rules are:</p>
           <p>1. Never miss a class and you will never fail. Try it 🙂</p>
           <p>2. AT A MINIMUM, put in same time as you do in class. For example, an hour and a half in class equals hour and a half same day going over notes and working on assignments.</p>
           <p>3. Exercise. And by that I mean, an exercise regiment where you elevate your heart rate. This can be running, basketball, soccer….. anything that pushes more blood to your brain.</p>
           <p>4. Good sleep.</p>
           <p>5. This point is an extension to number 1 I guess. PAY ATTENTION in class. You are in class anyways. Most times I see students in class who seem to be there just for the sake of taking down whatever is written on board and most of their time is spent on phones, laptops etc. That is A WASTE OF TIME. You have to relearn that hour and a half of lecture come exam time FOR EACH LECTURE. Thats why most students feel overwhelmed by course material. They went to class but that hour and half wasn’t spent learning ANYTHING except taking notes.<br> For me personally it gets challenging on days when you have straight 4 to 6 hrs of lectures. But I push through.</p>
           <p>6. Do your assignments on time and do all of them. In engineering, everything builds on the previous assignments mostly. You skip one assignment and then you’re lost on the next one.</p>
           <p>Hope these help. Good luck</p>

           <p>One bit of advice I have. If you’re close to failing one class, come finals time, just let it go. In your efforts to revive your failing grade you’ll likely end up hurting the grades in the rest of your classes. Spend more time studying for the classes you have a chance of getting good grades, and potentially even better grades, for. If you spend time worrying about passing a class and studying for it, your other grades will suffer. You can always retake a class if you fail; one failure won’t define you.</p>
