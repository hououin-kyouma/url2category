       <p>We know that students who work third shift and who maintain a high GPA have several factors in common. Review the following tips for Metropolitan College to learn how you can ensure your success in the MC program. Feel free to <a href="http://metro-college.com/about">contact a MC Student Development Counselor</a> if you have any questions or need additional guidance in planning. </p>

      <div class="constrained constrained--tight"> 
       <h2 class="section-heading"> Limit First Semester Enrollment </h2> 
       <ul>
        <li>UofL students should register for 9 credit hours or less <u>and</u> the 1 credit hour orientation course. JCTC students should register for no more than 3 classes: FYE105 and 2 proficiency areas (i.e. math and English). Both UofL and JCTC offer Metropolitan College cohort orientation courses taught by MC staff to provide additional support and guidance for the first term.</li> 
        <li>Taking more than 3&nbsp;classes during the first semester of the program can be challenging and put you at risk for not completing your courses with a C or better. Remember, you are working year-round so taking summer courses is a great option for staying on track! After having some time to become accustom to your new schedule, you can increase your course load the next semester. Make sure you communicate with your academic advisor to limit your first semester course load and maximize the summer semester to stay on track with your academic plan.</li> 
        <li>Effective course planning can reduce the chance of receiving an ineligible grade or withdrawing from a course. A majority of MC students who do not re-enroll in school the following semester have earned an ineligible grade or withdrew from a course.</li> 
       </ul> 
      </div> 
      <div class="constrained constrained--tight"> 
       <h2 class="section-heading"> Be Prepared and Have a Plan </h2> 
       <ul>
        <li> Making a schedule is very important for students starting out in the program. Students should be sure to plan adequate time for school, work, and sleep. By creating a realistic schedule and sticking to it, students can stay on track to meet their goals. Students who plan effectively when utilizing the Student Transition Program scheduling tool have better academic success rates. If you have questions about your schedule, please contact a Student Development Counselor for assistance.</li> 
        <li> Take time to plan a monthly budget and to ensure you can pay for educational costs not covered by the Metropolitan College program. Some of these uncovered costs include, but are not limited to: housing, transportation, books, and institutional fees. Also, be prepared to pay for unexpected costs. What if you withdraw from a class? You want to take an on-line course at UofL? Complete a course with an ineligible grade for payment? Always have a plan in place to address these concerns. You may find <a href="https://www.kheaa.com/website/kheaa/money_mgmt?main=1">some of these tools</a> helpful in planning.</li>

       <h2 class="section-heading"> ​Give Careful Consideration Before Working An Additional Job </h2> 
       <p>Here are some important questions to ask yourself before you apply to a second position: </p> 
       <ul>
        <li>Have I demonstrated I can maintain a high GPA with my current work load?</li> 
        <li>Does this position provide me with practical work experience that is related to my long term goal?</li> 
        <li>Is this position available during the weekends and/or during breaks from school?</li> 
        <li>Does this position require 10 or less hours a week?</li> 
        <li>Do I need this position to address financial NEEDS that cannot be met through better budgeting practices?</li> 
       </ul>
       <p>If you answered “No” to one or more of these questions, it is possible that this additional employment could become a barrier to achieving your academic and career goals.
