            <td valign="top" align="left" style="margin: 0px; width: 100%;"> <p>For most of us, thinking of high school graduation brings memories of walking across a stage to "Pomp and Circumstance" after four years of work. But for a persistent and overlooked group of students, the picture is different. At each graduation, there are students who take longer than four years to receive their diploma.</p> <p>While we admire their persistence,&nbsp;is it worth the extra effort? Keeping these students in school, and getting them to graduation day, takes a lot of time and effort on everyone's part, and a lot of extra resources from the school district. Little<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;is known about&nbsp;late high school graduates'&nbsp;eventual outcomes. If they ultimately receive no benefits from the extra time, a lot of school districts might want to rethink their policies.</p> <p>So is it better to graduate late than never? To answer this question, we compared late graduates to:</p>

              <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">GED recipients‚Äîstudents who earned a General Educational Development credential or equivalent. </li> 
              <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Dropouts‚Äîstudents who left high school before 2000 without receiving any type of high school credential. </li> 
              <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">On-time graduates‚Äîstudents who graduated in four years or less with a standard high school diploma. </li>

                <td align="left" style="margin: 0px; font: 12px arial; color: #666666;"> <p>In every aspect of life‚Äînot just academic, but work, civic life, and even health‚Äîon-time graduates had the best outcomes, so school districts should make on-time graduation for all students their first priority.</p> <p>But the extra work that late graduates and their high schools put into earning a diploma pays off‚Äînot only in late graduates‚Äô academic outcomes, but in jobs, involvement in civic life, and commitment to healthy lifestyles. Some examples you‚Äôll see in this&nbsp;guide include:</p> 
                 <ul style="padding: 6px; line-height: 1.2em; list-style-type: disc; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px 10px; font-size: 14px;"> 
                  <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Late graduates are much more likely to go on to obtain either a bachelors' or associates' degree. </li> 
                  <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Late graduates are more likely to be employed, and more likely to have full-time employment than GED recipients and dropouts. Late graduates are also significantly better off in terms of job benefits. </li> 
                  <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Late graduates are significantly more likely to have voted in a recent election. </li> 
                  <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Late graduates are more likely to make better health choices‚Äîthey are more likely to be non-smokers than GED recipients and dropouts and they exercise more. </li> 
                 </ul> <p>Essentially, a student facing late graduation has two options: Stay in school and earn a regular diploma late, or leave school and earn either nothing or a GED. Late graduates fare better compared to students who leave school and those who earn a GED.</p> </td>

While they are no more likely (59 percent) than GED recipients (51 percent) to enroll in college, they are much more likely to go on to obtain either an Associates or Bachelors degree.

However, on-time graduates were more likely<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;to be covered by health insurance than late graduates.

Late graduates were just as likely<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;as similar on-time graduates to exercise at least one or two days a week.</p> <p>When we compare all late graduates to all on-time graduates, it is clear on-time graduates are much more successful after high school. However, when we compare students of similar SES and and initial acheivement, the picture is far more mixed. In a perfect world students are better off graduating on-time. But if students do fall behind, they are much better off graduating late than never.</p> <p><span class="Title"><em>The path of a late graduate</em></span></p> <p>Little is known about late graduates, and more research needs to be conducted. What we can surmise about the path of the late graduate from this data, however, reveals that they start out in the same group as those who will eventually drop out or receive a GED. We also see that&nbsp; minority students or non-native English speaking students are more likely to graduate late. Students who live in poorer households, attend high schools in urban districts, and have two or more of the risk factors for dropping our are also more like to graduate late.</p> <p>Moreover, late graduates' preparation for high school is close to that of dropouts and GED recipients. In the eighth grade, they were no more prepared to go on to high school math or English. And they fall further behind their on-time classmates in ninth grade, where they mainly take non-academic math courses, if any math course at all.</p> <p>But in high school, the picture shifts slightly. Late graduates start making better grades than those who will eventually drop out or receive a GED. These results align with those Nobel Laureate economist James Heckman found in his research on GED recipients: That GED recipients were more likely to drop out of college (Cameron and Heckman 1993). Heckman also found that GED recipients had cognitive skills similar to high school dropouts. But, compared to students who graduated, GED recipients lacked non-cognitive skills such as thinking ahead, persisting at a task, and adapting to an environment (Heckman and Rubinstein 2001). Finally‚Äîperhaps simply due to perseverance‚Äîlate graduates accumulate significantly more credits than GED recipients or dropouts.</p> <p>The results of late graduates' persistence are striking. As stated earlier, late graduates do markedly better in all arenas than GED recipients or dropouts. And, controlled for SES and achievement level, they come close to on-time graduates' achievement. It's clear once again: The effort to keep students in school pays off.</p> <p><strong class="special">What should school boards do about late graduates?</strong></p> <p>Until recently, NCLB did not give credit to schools for students who earned a high school diploma beyond the traditional four years. (States can now have late graduates counted, however, they must apply.) But given the benefits we've illustrated, shouldn‚Äôt high schools be recognized for the time and resources used ensuring that students receive the help they need to earn a high school diploma, whether or not the process takes longer than four years?</p> <p>Accountability systems that only credit schools graduating students on time hold a narrow view of defining success after high school, especially for lower-achieving students. This reticence to recognize late graduates may be due to concern that late graduates aren‚Äôt as likely to earn a four-year college degree, and there is some truth in that. However, late graduates do have similar-quality jobs as on-time graduates from similar backgrounds and achievement levels and they display similar citizenship patterns.</p> <p>We have seen that late graduates are more likely to earn&nbsp;a college&nbsp;degree than GED recipients. Throughout high school and into college and the workplace students with higher high school graduation statuses are more and more successful. Of course this means it's best for students to graduate on time. But it also clearly shows that students are better off graduating late than never.</p> <p><span class="Title"><em>What does this mean for school board members?</em></span></p>

              <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Schools should continue to help students graduate on time. Nonetheless, it is worth the district‚Äôs time and resources to graduate students who fall behind, even if it takes longer than four years. </li> 
              <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The investment in these students could be reduced if a curriculum&nbsp;were in place to ensure that students are ready for high school work when they leave the eighth grade. </li> 
              <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">All students should take an academic math course in ninth grade to remain in the mathematics pipeline. </li>

              <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Provide support in high school for low-achieving students to develop the qualities Heckman talks about‚Äîthinking ahead, persistence, and adapting to an environment.

             <ul style="padding: 6px; line-height: 1.2em; list-style-type: disc; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px 10px; font-size: 14px;"> 
              <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Although on-time graduation is best, late graduates are still better situated after high school than students who dropped out or received a GED. </li> 
              <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Schools should be encouraged, through accountability systems, to keep all students in school until they graduate‚Äîwhether or not it takes longer than four years. It takes time and resources for schools to continue working with late graduates, but these efforts should be encouraged not discouraged. </li> 
              <li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Accountability systems should give schools credit for all students who graduate late, not just those from certain groups such as special education students or English language learners. Students from all backgrounds fall behind their peers for a variety of reasons‚Äîmany outside the school's control‚Äîso schools should get credit for graduating these students with a regular high school diploma. </li>
