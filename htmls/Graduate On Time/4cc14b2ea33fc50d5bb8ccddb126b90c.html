        <p>Hi all my name is J Griff3n and today i googled \"mom did not finish highschool\" and came aacross this blog... Well my mom had my brother at the age of 17; she is from Mississippi and ALL my family is from there. Today i am 23 years old transferring into a four year university. My brother is exactly 5 years minus one day older than me and my sister is 9 years younger than I. Today i looked at my brother andd got so damn sad because he did not finish high school but he did get his ged. He did not attend college and it is really heart breaking to me. I sit here literally having tears in my eyes saying my mom did not only even finish high school. She was not able to live freely because of us. I pray that i can help her in the future. Even though engineering does not guarantee anything, it is a start. It breaks my heart knowing only person my mom has is her. I feel so terrible because highschool was not the best and my grades were not either; I don\'t know man... It is depressing 100%... Like i think about were my mom comes from... She comes from NOTHING my whole family does: being black in mississippi back in the day was you all know terrible....sometimes i ask why me? But no handouts are given... Education is important.</p>

        <p>First off, I would like to congratulate you on choosing to pursue an undergraduate degree. My name is Anna Poteat, and I am a senior at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro and I am also a first generation college student. College is a place where I have been able to explore new interests and build upon the skills I have already developed. As an upperclassman, I have three tips that will save you time and sleepless nights: 1- Introduce yourself to your professors! Use your time in college to get to know your faculty. They are invaluable resources for advice, recommendation letters, and building your professional network. 2- Get involved! Make sure you are intentional about how you spend your time outside of the classroom. Join a student organization or volunteer! 3- Have fun! Make sure you cherish the experience of going to college! Being the first in your family to attend college is exciting! Enjoy the ride and make the most of your four years.</p>

        <p>Hello Everyone! My name is ADora Barren and I am a first generation student! My oldest brother didn't go to college, my second oldest brother didn't even finish high school. And then there's me. After my heart surgery I second guessed going to college, a university at that, because I didn't feel like I was capable of getting that far. After my dad was attacked and put into a nursing home I doubted myself because I didn't think I could afford it and to this day it still crosses my mind. Now I plan on going to Clark Atlanta University. I can say I'm a bit nervous because I don't know what to expect, what's next or the real deal of how college works because my family hasn't been there to give me pointers. I do come from a low income family but I'm determined that I will do everything in my soul to accomplish the obstacles that are bound to stand in my way so I can become a 2017 graduate!</p>

My mother graduated high school and my father dropped out his freshman year, after that they didn't pursue any further education. I have four older sisters, and one older brother, who all dropped out and worked towards their GED. My family's past made me feel that graduating wasn't important, and in turn lead me to believe that college was just a waste of money. Despite my stance on schooling, I worked very hard and graduated with a 3.8 GPA. I loved to learn and when some family friends spent time with me and discovered that I would thrive in a college environment they helped me find a school that would suit me, and inspired me to apply to CCAD, where I will be attending in the fall. Do not think that your circumstances are also your future! Become something great.</p>

       </header> 
       <div class="copy co2"> 
        <p>My name is Angel LaBoo. I have lived in Baltimore my whole life. When I was three years old, my mother gave me to my grandmother because she could not take care of me and my little sister. I would always cry for my mother saying,” When will she come back to come and get me?” My grandmother would always stop me crying and look at me in my eyes and tell me “Angel, your mother loves you very much but, you have to stay here with me so I can take care of you so you can be the best that you can be”. So from hearing those words over and over again, it made me want to work hard. I struggled in reading and in math in elementary school. I needed extra help to keep up with my classes, so I went to summer school and I did this every year in elementary. When I was in elementary school, I would see everyone figuring out the solutions to the problems quickly and I would be still trying to figure out the problem. I would feel frustrated that I wouldn’t understand the work but I would continue to push myself to get to where the other kids were. In fourth grade, this is when I was working hard in school and figured out that my interest was science especially since it was something that I was good at. I love science because of the discovery of new things. As a child, I had a dream of becoming a scientist, inventor and an astronaut. I could not choose which one I really wanted to be so I had all these ideas and would always change of what I wanted to be in the future. The reason I wanted to be a scientist or an inventor was to make the world a better place. The reason I wanted to be an astronaut was so I could see the stars. All I knew was that I wanted to do something that made me think “why did this happen?” or “how can I solve the problem?” This made me realize what I wanted to do in the future so it made me know what my main focus was. In middle school, I had the same teacher for science for two years and her name is Ann Gorton. She wasn’t just an ordinary science teacher or just a teacher for that matter. She actually made me science interesting and would make science jokes like one time, she said ”look at my boobies” and everyone was so confused and she had a picture of birds and was like ”those are my boobies because they are a type of bird.” Since she made it so interesting it made me realize that I wanted to study science in high school and college and so on. In ninth grade, I took biology which made me want to be a veterinarian because in this class we talked about different types of animals. Since I knew what I wanted to do in the future, I started researching my career in avid 10. In tenth grade, I was studying chemistry and I thought it was interesting since I was going to use this when I prescribed medication. In my junior year, I took a lot of science classes to help me better understand the world. Now here I am, I’ve changed so much since then and ever since I was little I never let anything get in my way of reaching my goal of becoming a vet what I needed to accomplish this goal one day by going around the country and collecting strays that are about to be put down or strays that are in the street and feed them and give them the medication and vitamins they need to survive and give them a great home to live in.</p>

       <div class="copy co2"> 
        <p>My name is Adam and despite being a first generation college student, I just started the first year of my PhD at Yale University, studying conservation genetics and evolution. My mom has been working as a secretary for her entire life, the same job she had in high school that she started when she was 19. My parents divorced when I was an infant, so she raised me as a single mother. I always knew that I wanted to go to college, but honestly I didn’t have very high expectations. I thought a state school and huge loans were the best I could hope for. On a whim I applied to a private school in Wisconsin called Northland College. When I got the decision letters back, Northland had offered me a huge scholarship. My dad struggled with alcoholism his entire life and died unexpectedly not long before I heard back from schools. The little bit from his life insurance and the scholarship meant that an out-of-state private school was actually feasible. I finished my bachelor’s degree in Environmental Studies a year early and took a job in Alaska. Three years ago I decided to try to go to graduate school. I managed to cobble together enough scholarships, grants, and assistantships to get my Masters from University of Montana without having to take out loans. I realized during my Masters that I love the challenge of discovering and understanding the intricacies of our world. So, I applied to PhD programs, and was literally breathless when Yale offered me a full ride. For those of us without a model to see a trajectory past high school, the task of applying to, figuring out how to pay for, and surviving in college is an almost insurmountable challenge. You will feel lonely and lost. But don’t give up--the reward at the end extends long into your future and far surpasses the hardships. After all, in academics, every challenge is literally a learning opportunity. And don’t be afraid to ask for help. Universities are full of people who are invested in your future--call on them. And never let the perspective of others determine your success. Achieve exactly what you dream, and always know that you earned it. </p>

I was only 15 years old when I became a mother so It hasn't been easy. Finally, here i am about to finish my sophomore year of college. Neither one of my parents made it passed junior high so for my family this is a huge deal.</p>

        <p>My name is Destiny Will and I will be first! I am from a family of 17 kids and 15 of them including me are adopted and minorities. I am here studying at Marquette University in Wisconsin trying to be the first successful of the 15 adopted kids in my family. I have always been encouraged by my parents to attend college and decided at a very early age that I would attend college after watching my siblings experiences in life compared to my two non adopted sibling who complete college. Even though I only in my first semester of college, I have experienced the respect that come with attending a school like Marquette and the power and strength of the relationship between Marquette Alumni and current students. My advice to those who are in similar situation is to never doubt yourself. Its hard to not compare yourself to previous family members who have not successfully completed college and to get rid of the constant thought that you are going to end up just like them, but you have to. Remind yourself everyday that you are capable and going to succeed because you are unique, strong, and an inspiration to your younger siblings.</p>

        <p>Along my college journey, I have learned so much about myself in ways that i can't describe. Being the first in the family brings about many characteristics about yourself that you wouldn't know unless you experience it first hand. You will realize that you're very different from your peers. You will notice that the wage gap exists, however that shouldn't stop you from reaching your goals of attaining a quality education. You will face challenges and obstacles that may feel like pressure on you, however I can assure you 100% that when you overcome those difficult moments you will rise up from the ashes into a fierce phoenix stronger than ever before. When success is the only thing on your mind, the universe conspires to make it happen for you. Talk to your professors. Don't feel afraid to ask for help when you need it the most. Take your time to study for exams. When in doubt, tell yourself "this too shall pass."</p>

If I didn't get into my first choice I thought this was all I have left. It is close to home and pretty affordable. I stay off-campus living at home with my parents and little sister. My parents work shifts to the point where they don't even get to see each other. Since I am home I am in charge of picking up my sister and taking her to after school practices. Most of the time it gets in the way of my own time for me to simply have a study session with my group, attend a school event, or just finding time for myself. My mom does not want me to get a part time job simply because of my sister. I originally applied for Nursing, which was later changed to Biology Pre-Dental. Unfortunately I did not know that the job I wanted as a Dental Hygienist was not going to get me a job from this area of study (Pre-Dental), or so I was told. I've contemplated many other majors and interests but I still tell myself that this is not the school for me. My dream school is far too expensive for me and I didn't get accepted into it in the first place so it crushed me a little inside.<br><br> What keeps you motivated to succeed in college?<br><br> I grew up with parents who were born in very poor and small countries, Cambodia to be specific. They moved to America in their teens. My dad had a late start on his education and my mom finished high school and attended community college, but not for long because me and my little sister needed her to be home with us. So long story short none of my parents have a degree. The situation with my family motivates me to do really well. I want to be able to come home and make them proud of me one day. When people tell me I need to major in something I want to do and not what my parents or anyone else think I should do, I agree, but in my situation it seems more complicated. It is difficult to satisfy my parents. My mom has finally agreed to let me do whatever I want, but I have chosen to stick to something that they can really be proud about. I don't want them to worry about me not finding a good job when I graduate. I want them to be stress free and especially not worry about our financial situation. I want to be there for them just as much as they have always been there for me.</p>

Also, the school offered a wide variety of engineering fields available and I was unsure of what I wanted pursue except that I loved math.</p>

That can last for days, but I get my job done. For me, there is no such thing as failure. I mean, the situation when you didn't try and just backed up. That's not about me. I usually get the moment of truth, eye-opening, when I understand that some chances and opportunities can vanish if I don't do what I have to. There will be no such day as today and no other life than I have now. This sober thought usually makes me motivated and productive.<br><br> How do you balance work and classes?<br><br> I was working part time, sometimes on campus (and it was pretty easy to balance everything), took some summer jobs and also had some freelance opportunities. The last thing demanded some discipline, time management skills and self organization to get everything done, gain experience, money and remain a college student. I had to learn how to manage my time and know exactly how long it would take to do something (homework, writing for projects, classes, etc.). There were days when I barely had time to eat or walk around, several times I had to miss a class. But I learned how to not overload myself with work, how long different tasks take to be finished and how to discipline myself and avoid procrastination.</p>

When I received my acceptance letter from Northwest Nazarene University, I sat on my bed staring at the paper with tears running down my face because I have been dreaming about attending NNU for the past four years!

My parents have made way too many sacrifices for me to give up for any given reason. Graduating college is a goal I have to achieve not only for me, but for them.</p>

I was raised in public housing. I was aware that coming from this background would bring challenges and fears. I decided college was going to be more than a place to get a classroom education. College for me was going to be a place where I needed to maximize my mental, emotional, professional and personal growth. So I did the following: (1) I joined both professional and social organizations (2) I served as a mentor to a local high school (3) I made friends and socialized with people who had a positive mindset (4) I was a part of study groups that were serious and focused (5) I scheduled in time to relax and refresh my mind such as nature trips or meditation (6) I had favorite inspirational quotes I would read daily (7) I had a vision board on my wall of what I wanted to accomplish for that semester (8) I created a list of my top 3 reasons for being in college and reviewed it especially when I was doubting myself (9) I found mentors to prepare me for life after college and to keep me motivated when college became stressful (10) I realized that I was a trailblazer and I remained proud of myself for investing in my future and going to college. These 10 strategies helped me to become an Environmental Scientist and Business Owner. I used some of these same type strategies now as a professional.<br><br> How do you balance work and classes?<br><br> Balancing work and classes is an important skill to learn in college. I worked a part-time job, interned and took multiple classes. I was successful in handling all these responsibilities because of prioritization, time and energy management. Initially I had to understand the purpose for everything I was doing. I think this is the most important step, to answer the question why you are pursuing or involved in certain things. I decided what was important based on how it would empower me now and how it would help me in the future. Once I had that list I prioritized what I needed to do and how I could schedule it in. I created set goals for my work income, internship and my classes. I managed my time by creating a schedule for myself and committed to following that schedule. Time is all we have so we have to respect it. So I respected my time and followed my set schedule as closely as possible. Sometimes I was a procrastinator yet I refocused on my purpose for my goals and got back on track. I also realized that I would have to manage my energy. For me that meant how much emotional and mental energy I invested in situations and people that were not work or class related. I realized those choices would impact my work and class life in some way. Also I used career services, mentors and talked with my academic adviser to help sort things out. Lastly, the balancing act was challenging so stayed flexible and was creative with ideas. I do the same now as I balance my professional and personal life.</p>

        <p>What college are you attending?<br><br> Wake Technical Community College<br><br> Tell us a bit more - what are you studying? When will you graduate?<br><br> I'm going Full-Time, majoring in Business and Accounting, with a graduation year of 2017.<br><br> What types of extracurriculars do you participate in?<br><br> Why did you choose the college you're attending?<br><br> I had done a lot of research on going to college when I was younger. I had really wanted to go to college but because nobody in my family had ever attended college, it was such a daunting task. Much of the information available to me had an undertone of "well of course you know the process, everyone does!". This simply just wasn't the case. My high school grades were average and my extracurriculars centered more on my church than it did on academics. My school counselors just assumed that I wasn't on a college track and thus I was grouped in with the kids who were just trying to graduate. I even remember a counselor laughing when on a sheet I had said that I was interested in studying business. I had misspelled the word business and she said "I find it funny that someone who cant even spell it would want to try and study it." Anyways, I left high school and immediately started working. It was not until age 23 when I really felt the need to make a change. Minimum wage jobs simply cannot suffice. My girlfriend, who was just about to graduate college, helped me through the process. I decided that because of my age and lackluster performance in high school, I opted to go to community college and then try and transfer to a 4 year. Even for a community college, it was such a daunting task. However I made it in and I have been enrolled for a year and a half. As I sit here and type this now, my application to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte has just been submitted (as of 10 minutes ago) and I am so excited to see the result.<br><br> How do you balance work and classes?<br><br> The hardest part of balancing work and school is time management. Now, this is a key word that immediately causes me to get distracted, tired, and bored. However, time management is simply something that has to be learned (sometimes the hard way). I have ADHD and I find that the methods that I used to get by in high school absolutely do not cut it. You absolutely have to find time and decide what your priorities are. For me that means that I have had to learn how to use a planner. I need to sit down each day and decide precisely what it is that needs to be done that day. I write out my work schedule in my planner and then I frequently check my class websites for changes to the schedule and new assignments. One of the hardest things that I have found that requires a lot of practice is sticking to your plan. The idea that you need to dedicated 2 hours of work for each credit hour of your class is absolutely true. This means that your priorities outside of work are school and then social activities should be worked in around that, not vice versa. Once you strike this balance, youll find that youll have much less stress surrounding time management and you will have much better success in school</p>

        <p>What college are you attending?<br><br> Tufts University<br><br> Tell us a bit more - what are you studying?

When I went home and started researching about the school, I somehow came across the application for Voices of Tufts– a fly-in program that gives high school seniors the opportunity to visit Tufts for a college tour as a diversity recruitment effort. Decided to give it a try, I quickly applied without expecting much. However, much to my surprise, I was selected to participate in the program. Through my three days spent at Tufts, I was impressed at how all the Tufts students I encountered were smart, humble, quirky and passionate about solving the world’s problems. I visited several in-state colleges before, yet none of their students ever spoke to me so enthusiastically about what they studied like the ones I met at Tufts. Tufts also showed me how it successfully fostered a "study-abroad culture” with nearly half of the junior class going abroad every year. The school’s location – near the greatest college town of America and in the New England area - was also a big plus since I wanted to have a much different experience than what I had in Texas. But most of all, I fell in love with the playful, welcoming and engaging vibe of the school, which ultimately led me to apply Early Decision 2 to Tufts. When the admission results came out in February bringing along the good news, I had no doubt that I would enroll to the school at any price. However, it was the full-need financial aid that Tufts offered that provided a huge relief and made my final decision much easier to make.<br><br> What keeps you motivated to succeed in college?<br><br> My family would be the first factor that keeps me moving forward in any situation. My parents have already sacrificed a lot for me to come to the U.S from Vietnam, and thus making them proud has always been a priority to me. I am also lucky to have the freedom in pursuing any major I am interested in. It's meaningful that my parents do not put me under the pressure to follow a Pre-Med or Pre-Law track like other Asian immigrant parents usually expect of their children. It has certainly helped me value my education even more. Along with my family, there has been countless people who have selflessly helped me along my journey to pursue a higher education. From my high school English teachers to my college interviewer and many more, these people have also serve as great motivation for me to not give up too easily. In high school, I was selected to be part of a college prep program named EMERGE that helped me navigate through the college application process. Yet, the support and encouragement I received from the program staff, mentors, and my peers did not end with my high school graduation. I have been fortunate to only expand that support network in college through BLAST (Bridge to Liberal Arts Success at Tufts), a bridge program for predominately first-generation students from underprivileged communities. EMERGE and BLAST have been the two main resources that I have always turned to when I needed academic and social support, or simply inspiration to keep on working harder. Knowing that there is people that believe in my potential stops me from letting them and myself down. And last but not least, I believe that knowledge is power and pursuing a higher education is my only way to achieve upward mobility, which would benefit not only me and family but also my community for the better.</p>

Although it is difficult to stand out among thousands, I personally prefer the challenge of having to work hard to be noticed among the sea of extraordinary students. Secondly, I wanted a big school because that means there are thousands of potential alumni networks to assist in job and internship searches. I was able to complete two excellent internships because proud two Gauchos (our mascot) wanted to give another fellow Gaucho an opportunity. Lastly, I chose UCSB because it is a reasonable distance from home. While in school I was able to come home a couple times a month to visit family, do laundry, and pick up food. Still even with this distance I had my independence in the dorms freshman year and my own apartment the following years. I treasured not having to live at home.<br><br> What keeps you motivated to succeed in college?<br><br> Like many first generation students my motivation to succeed is my family. My parents immigrated here from Guatemala so that they could have a better life for themselves and their future children. My education is especially significant to me because my grandmother is illiterate having never attended a day of school in her life. My dad only recently earned his G.E.D. and my mom was only able to go to school until the 8th grade in Guatemala. Both my parents and my grandma are incredibly intelligent people. Although she cannot read, my grandma can count money, my dad likes to read/research topics he finds interesting by reading the Encyclopedia Britannica and my mom can manage a budget so accurately that I think she should work in government to reduce debt there. I am motivated to succeed because my diploma is not just mine, it is a symbol of how far my family has progressed. It shows that all our sacrifices have been worth it. My other source of motivation is my sisters who are both enrolled in university and on track to earn their own degrees. Even when I feel like giving up on school my sisters remind me how much they admire me and hope to follow in my footsteps. It is impossible to quit when I know I have my sisters expectations to live up to.</p>

When I'm not at work I try to keep my reading assignments with me throughout the day; there is always extra time in the day—between classes or during lunch—to finish them. Getting ahead on assignments helps, because once major projects or papers come up it is easy to fall behind. Also, good habits—highlighting reading material for quotes to be used in future papers or creating an outline for your paper—help reduce the amount of time spent on assignments.<br><br> What keeps you motivated to succeed in college?<br><br> I see myself and my family struggling to make ends meet, and that is not the life I want for us. We shouldn't have to put off buying necessities because it's "too expensive." I believe that by getting my degree and securing a good job, we won't have to struggle anymore. In the end our struggle will ensure our future will be simpler; no more long nights, no more minimum paying jobs, no longer will I have to work two jobs, and when I need to buy a pair of shoes I can.</p>

When I look at her I can see myself and all the things I never had. I grew up very poor, and as a result not very popular. I was also stuck in the mindset that poor people don't succeed in life. I know now that a person's success does't hinge upon their financial situation but solely on their will. I look forward to the days when I sit alongside my daughter and do homework with her. I needed a role model as a child and never had one, and it brings me great joy that I can be a role model for my child.<br><br> How do you balance work and classes?<br><br> Balancing work and classes is a bit of a struggle. I just finished my first semester and learned that my usual habit of procrastinating to the last minute is something that doesn't work in college. I found that procrastination increased my stress dramatically especially with the time I lost to work that I could have used to study. About halfway through the semester I realized that I needed to break that habit if I wanted to succeed and make it to graduation. So now, in order to stay sane, I begin work on my projects the day I get them, thereby finishing them well before they are due and alleviating any anxiety that would be had by a rapidly approaching deadline. That way, when I'm at work, I can focus on work, and not have to worry about what assignment I've been putting off.</p>

We think of Associate's degrees as two year degrees and Bachelor's degrees as four year degrees, yet participating at a 12 credit hour per semester rate will typically add a year for an Associates degree and another year for a Bachelor's. When you have to work your way through college you have to make really tough decisions. Should I put off my degree and and work more, or accumulate student loan debt and hope I can pay it off? I consider myself a student first, and a worker second. I'm working the minimum amount of hours I need to pay my bills. Unfortunately, I'm taking a risk with student loans in the hopes of getting a good job sooner. Your best bet is to apply for as many scholarships and grants as you are eligible for. You might think that you're not going to be the best applicant, but you surely won't get any scholarships that you don't apply for. Writing the essays improves your writing abilities and that WILL benefit you even after college. Also, look into the federal work study program. Chances are, your school will offer a part time job that will relate to your field. It's also a great opportunity to make connections with the staff and faculty that can benefit you later on.<br><br> What keeps you motivated to succeed in college?<br><br> I participate in my Student Government. The leadership position really motivates me to fill those shoes in the classroom and to hold myself as a standard for the good student. Participating in school clubs and activities makes you feel more connected to the culture of the school and makes you want to be a success story.</p>

And there hasn't been a single day where I've regretted my decision.<br><br> What keeps you motivated to succeed in college?<br><br> 1) My gpa is perpetually motivating me. I really messed up a few semesters ago, and I've been playing catch up. It's not fun. Sure, "D's get degrees," but why not go for an A? 2) I see people around town, and when I go home. They all motivate me to do well. I don't want to live pay check to pay check. 3) Other students motivate me as well. I see people from the same socio-economic background, and how they're expecting everything just to be handed to them, and then I see people who come from less, and they are working hard. 4) And my parents motivate me. Neither of them went to college. I love seeing how proud they are of me every semester when I go back.</p>

I take care of my little buddy (down syndrome, dementia) during nights. I see him 4 hours out of the 10 I am there. After he goes to sleep I study constantly and relax. This frees up time at home and gives more time with friends. My little buddy will help me study too, and also reminds me why I love my field of study and presses me forward to learn more.</p>

I am the eldest child in my family, and since my parents did not have much of an education growing up, I am expected to do well in school and help out with finances. I am very close to my mom, and I really hope to succeed and find a stable, well-paying job so that she will not have to worry and stress out so much anymore.<br><br> How do you balance work and classes?<br><br> It is definitely a hard task, no doubt. I am huge on planning, and my calendar is always filled with reminders and homework due dates. Each week, I work out what I have to work on and which day I will work on each assignment. It is the best way for me to keep track of all my assignments, and I make sure I stick to that schedule. It is pretty tough since many of my friends live on my floor, but I try my best to remind myself to get my work done instead of watching a movie with them, or just hanging out since I know I can do those things with them later on.</p>

        <p>In Veracruz, the wind moves and sand along the beach, waves and dolphins jump and sing from the salty water. In the kitchen, windows open, mi abuelita steams tamales. I was born in Mexico, Veracruz but I grew up in the United States. I come from a poor family and hardworking that will do anything to make money to eat. My mom that was already in the U.S she saved money so a coyote could pass me through the border. Entering into a new country I got beaten by people and cursed at. It was a disgrace people treating me that way because I was brown Mexican and I dint speak the same language as they did I felt weak to them I was taboo. Going through many things at the age of seven I got help from a bilingual teacher at Booker T. Washington Elementary Mrs. Espinoza; who help me out with speaking English reading and writing. Mrs. Espinoza was like a mom to me she only didn’t help me out with my work but also she talks to me a lot about my culture and how I felt she was always the one will talk about my life and experiences. I started getting more involved into the Latino community In Lexington, stepping into high school I found out about a group of Latinos called LOL (Latino Outreach Leadership) In Dunbar High School. I and other participants got to start sharing the stories of us individuals and prove the people that we were created equal and that we had the same rights as everyone, in a book named Living Out Loud by us the students thanks to Mrs. Alvarez to reach us and publishing and making the book for us. Also we let other immigrants not just Latinos that we are there for them and that we can help them, getting involve into the community. Now we are looking forward to get all the Latino Communities to get together such ass LOL, Esperanza Club, LLCEC (Latino Leadership and College Experience Camp) and others. Making a huge fundraiser to raise money for more camps that youth immigrants across Kentucky can attend with preparation and leadership development experiences. There were difficult challenges to overcome, money wise in the year’s camp. We are raising awareness and give the same opportunities and resources to those who lack. We are asking for donations that can help Latino Communities grow very penny counts. I believe the next step in my life would be my College education. Going through tough times and coming to the United States, all the sacrifice that it been for me to come to a new country. For me to have a better education and a better life being successful in everything, being told everyday “You will be better than me” by my aunt. I want to have a career I can enjoy in life I don’t want to be like that kind of people that says I don’t like what I do and they are just boring with the old stuff. I would love to experience something new going out on my self being more responsible, getting more influence with the community. I’m already making an impact on others why not in college where I can get more involve and help people do something for others and feeling great for myself. I want to be there for kids that been through the same I’ve been through and guide them and show them hope, that the only way out through poverty is through education. My education will always come first so I would do my best to get my self-caught up in the class room, focusing never giving up in the classroom.</p>

        <p>I grew up in Fort Myers, FL and am the first to graduate from high school, undergraduate school (go noles!), and will be the first to earn my masters next summer through the University of Tampa. My first impression of college was overwhelming and exciting. I didn\'t know what I was doing or who I was supposed to be, but was happy to be there. I had to work while in school and often felt alone in my endeavor when I did not have parents who were able to be there for academic or financial support. My biggest piece of advice is to always have confidence in yourself. Do not allow your hardships to separate you from other college students, to make you feel inferior, or bitter. You are accomplishing something that no one else in your family has - be proud! When you feel like you are falling behind, do not be afraid to seek out help. Reach out to friends, their parents, mentors, other first gen\'s, university resources - anyone who is willing to help. You are doing great, be a sponge, and stay focused.</p>

        <p>I am the first in my family to ever attend a 4 year university. Before my father earned his GED in prison he had an education of a seventh grader. My mother did have a chance to go to college but she ended up pregnant. It is a huge accomplishment for me to even graduate high school because neither of my brothers did. My eldest brother graduated from a continuation school and a few years after his graduation he went to a community college. He would have went to a university but was stopped. My eldest brother suffers from drug addiction and sadly though he is brilliant and bright has not been able to go far in his life because of his addiction. There is no one that can guide me in my family. There is no one that knows what college life will even be like. There is no one that has ever left on their own. I am the first. I am the first to graduate from an actual high school. I am the first to go from high school to a university. I am the first that will leave to college and dorm. I am the first and i proud. All of my life they expected me to turn out like my brothers and end up in juvenile hall or turn out like my mom and end up pregnant. I was never expected to go to the university i will be attending to next year. I was not smart enough. I did not come from the right family. I had no potential. I will never achieve anything in life. I was not going to graduate. I was not going to get into a university. Well i did graduate and i did get into a great university. I am smart enough. I do have the determination. I am the first but i will not be the last. I have to set an example for my sister. She will never hear the words that i have. She will hear that she can do anything that she sets her mind to do. Despite the family that we come from. Despite how others may look at us. Despite all the discrimination and the obstacles we may face. I can do it and so can she. I will be attending the University of California Santa Cruz. It is not a cheap school and i cannot afford this school. However, that has not stopped me from going there and that will not stop me from anything else. I do need scholarships and i hope you will grant me this one because I am the definition of a first generation. I was not expected to make anything of myself but i attend to prove everyone wrong and I hope that you will help me achieve that goal.</p>

I go to an underfunded public school, so my guidance counselor isn't very helpful. I've struggled a ton during high school, with issues such as bullying and homelessness. Today, I'm a happy, successful student with a 90 GPA. I've been accepted into two schools so far, and I'm waiting on four more (my top choice is Temple University!) Being a first-generation student is difficult, and this becomes more prominent in high school. But, it also gives us motivation to continue our education, so we're able to have easier lives than our parents.</p>

My dad went to college 47 years ago...so who knows what college was like back then. Sometimes I dont feel like they know how hard I've actually worked to be graduating with honors. They act like the research paper I have to write means nothing, but I always finish my work. I changed my major and took a semester off, but here I am. My advice as cliche as it may sound: take advantage of scholarships, get involved with clubs, volunteer, and do it for yourself, no one else! I wish someone had told me those things back when I finished high school. College is tough but it will truly help you become the person you want to be!</p>

They want to support me but they cant pay for it so they just ignore it and tell me if I can work for it then congrats to me. The hardest part is having 2 brothers who don't want to go to college, I stress to them everyday how important college is and how much it will benefit them. I have worked really hard to get this far (Senior in High School) and I have been accepted into Bob Jones University to major in Nursing.

I'm going Full-Time, majoring in Computer Sciences and Technology, with a graduation year of 2015. What types of extracurriculars do you participate in? Clubs/Interest Groups What keeps you motivated to succeed in college? I know that education is a route to stability in life and a way to achieve goals. I've also surrounded myself around other passionate and encouraging people who inspire me to do my best. Furthermore, I'm determined to not be the person working every day of my life at a job that I hate when I know that I can be out here doing something valuable for myself and society. Why did you choose the college you’re attending? I chose the college I have now graduated from based on what I heard about through a teacher in high school and what I found while I was researching colleges within the state. I wanted to branch out while still being able to visit my family so I moved 2.5 hours away. Also, the school offered a wide variety of engineering fields available and I was unsure of what I wanted pursue except that I loved math.</p>

        <p>How My Dreams Came True in Idaho Coming from Eastern Europe, I experienced serious difficulties with my learning. First, my parents have no higher education, so they could not pay for any college or university. Second, they were not very wealthy people. They also could not afford to hire a tutor for me. As my high school had low test scores and ranking, my literacy rate used to be very poor. I was feeling awkward because of that. Earlier, there were even no AP classes in my school. My dream of graduating from college seemed too imaginary. But recently it all changed for a better. I am now a lucky student of the West Los Angeles University in Inglewood. But my trip to the United States began unpleasantly. It was hard to cope with all cultural differences and misunderstanding. I got stuck in the number of tricky situations as my English was also poor at first. It was a real challenge to find a decent school here, in the States. The first step on the way to my dream was entering Weiser High School in Idaho. This event helped me to get closer to a range of things that are still incomprehensible to people from my native country. I am talking about recycling, green projects, IT charity, multinational cultures, e-commerce, and more. Weiser High School performed well at different state competitions such as Idaho State Science Olympiad, so this fact proves the competence of this educational institution. Despite I focused on biology and chemistry, it did not prevent me from becoming a marketing specialist. WHS proved that we have unlimited opportunities thanks to appropriate education. It was not easy to study everything from another aspect. Besides, I barely understood these issues in English. However, I always had a passion for learning, so I decided not to give up. I invested all my creativity and efforts in mastering English language and other subjects. I am proud to announce that I am the first person who ever attended college in my family. I’ll share some of the details to explain how I achieved this goal. To earn per living, I had to work in various fast food restaurants and delivery companies. Also, as my English progressed, I started to train other foreign students. Thus, my language skills have improved significantly. One of my first impressive projects involved assisting foreign students in their remote education and researching. I taught them to structure essays and term papers properly. I could not believe my luck when I was offered an internship in Palmolive-Colgate as a marketing consultant as I had never dreamt of joining the highly competitive business world. I realized the importance of education even more. I keep moving on and supporting other students who have hard times after transferring to the United States. There are a lot of them in my city; they lack both experience and knowledge of English. I help them to find a well-paid and interesting job by pointing to the role of education in their life. As a part of the marketing team, I appreciate the opportunity to live in the country with so many options. One thing that I know for sure is that my school in Idaho was the most crucial success factor in my entire life and career.</p>

        <p>My name is Vivian Vy Hoang and I'm first. First means a lot of things to me: being the first born child, placing first in academic rankings, winning first place at sports, being the first to attend college, and is the first and only one to lead an example for my younger brother. First sounds great, due to the entitlement of having full authority and respect, doesn't it? The idea of being the first should feel like living a life full of satisfaction. The satisfaction of fulfilling my parents hard work and aspirations of the American Dream; as well as feeling a sense of pride and honor of successes. Sure, I am given all the glory about the successes that I have paved for myself; but being first also jaded me with not being able to living the life I desire. When people think of "first", typically it means: you are responsible, head of the family, strong, hardworking, and smart. No one understands my life of being this kind of first. So let me tell you the kind of first I had to endure. I am the first point of contact for everything and anything that happens in the family whether it\'s direct family or extended family. The first to experience and witness my parents' separation and divorce alongside periodic parental arguments. The first to give up all teenage/young adult life to go find a job and help out the family instead of socializing/hanging out with friends of my age care-freely. The first to understand true sacrifice and hardwork through being frugal and having a part time job half way through high school. The first to sweat blood, tears and not being able to give up during potential mental breakdown moments. Now let me tell you what I'm not the first at even although perceived to be the first at: I am the first in my family to have never gotten the chance to fully experienced the college life due to helping out family financial difficulty through working while going to school full time. I am the first to having to give up anything and everything just to make sure my brother gets the perfect structure to his journey of successes because I am supposedly more experienced and mature. I am the first to sacrifice my own happiness through having lower access of freedom on spending money and carrying out duties compared to the second child: my younger brother. Maybe the children's chant about "first being the worst and second being the best" is a sign of mankind in this cruel world. There's two types of people in this world: the first and the second. And to be honest, I wish I was not the first. I wish I can just live a simple life full of love and support. I wish I can be naughty for once and do whatever i want. But truth is, life is no fairytale or movie. Life is full of firsts. Some are just luckier than others.</p>

        <p>Where I Am From: A Poem I am from the unstable minds of those who decided to become parents. From growing up too fast because I had to, but always questioning why I had to. I am from the ups and downs of emotion that run rapidly through the hallways into each bedroom and empty out into a world that is blind to what they do not wish to see. I am from the laughs and giggles of neighborhood kids as we ran through the streets like we knew what life was all about but really had no idea until the sad truth settled beneath our subconscious cries for help. From the pure moments of happiness that were few and far between but still meant the world to me as they randomly came into my life at the times I needed them most. I am from the hushed whispers and blinded stares of my own family members and friends pointing at my life and my upbringing thinking they know all about these struggles I face but in fact have no idea because they can’t even look me in the eye and ask me what its like to be raised by someone not in control of her own feelings, thoughts, and emotions. I am from a hidden secret and even though I was only a child that moment in time seems to be tattooed into my memory the exact same way that memory was forced upon me. And to this day I still struggle with the fact that I was too scared to tell someone so instead I just made myself forget that part of my life even though it resurfaces every time I attempt a relationship with the opposite sex. I am from a little blonde haired blue-eyed boy who sometimes calls me mommy even though I did not give birth to him but he will forever and always be my source of strength and love. I am from ER visits and psych admissions with one particular incident in mind that was the worst I had ever seen but no one seemed to care that it was and is tearing our family apart not just because of her but because of all the people around her that standby and do nothing about it which is just as bad as being the problem. I am from a high school that cared more about the score on the football field than the scores on student’s assignments until I made a choice to have a say in what I wanted for my education and go to a different school that followed a more technical approach which was a decision that changed by future to something that meant more than just getting by. I am from a college application, government grants, awarded scholarships, and my first steps onto a college campus not knowing if I would be able to accomplish such a goal that no woman in my family has yet achieved. From late night study sessions, twelve-hour shifts, and never-ending final exams to establishing a career goal, working hard, and staying determined no matter what obstacles came my way. I am from those nights of terror not knowing where I was going to sleep at night because my home situation filled me with more fear, anger, and sadness than sleeping in my car in an abandoned parking lot could ever do. But I am also from those same nights of fear that led me to seek out the goodness in the people around me and except the help I desperately needed from those who I thought were crazy to take in a complete stranger off the streets for a few nights that turned into months were I felt so happy and safe and a sense of family that I was not used too but to this day still gives me hope that I will have the same love and respect in my own family I choose to make one day. I am from abuse. I am from mental illness. I am from drugs, alcohol, and prescription medication. But I am also from hope. I am from strength. And I am from independence. I am from all of these things and still more things to come that I have not yet even thought about. But I will always say that I am so very proud to come from all of these things.</p>

        <p>I am Patricia Duenas and I'm First.. My mother, along with her brother and sisters were the first ones from my family to migrate to the United States from the Philippines, making me a first generation American as well. My transition from high school to college was tough due to the difficulty of learning how to do essentially everything on my own; the Fafsa, purchasing dorm necessities, expenses, registering for classes, etc. Trust me, if you are a first generation student, I completely understand where you are coming from, but I am here to tell you that you CAN break the cycle and go against the odds. I am saying it is 100% possible to embark on your own college journey if you just find your passion and believe in yourself. Luckily, my college experience has influenced me to step out of my comfort zone. I found my "second family" by getting involved with the Filipino-American Student Association. I also got heavily involved with the Miss America Scholarship Organization, where I hold the current title of Miss Tucson Desert Rose 2015. Through this non-profit organization, I have chosen the platform of "First Generation Higher Education", in which I support and empower first generation students just like myself. My platform has led me to work with some incredible organization such as The Shine Project, John Valenzuela Youth Center, Girl Scouts of Southern Arizona, and more. Through these organizations, I strive to serve as the "bridge" to provide first generation students and at-risk youth with the necessary tools to taking their first step in obtaining the proper education they are all entitled to. I truly believe it is a privilege to have the opportunity to make a better living for myself through higher education. I am currently a junior at the University of Arizona and I strive to graduate with a BSN (Nursing Bachelor\'s degree) and continue my college journey by attending graduate school to obtain a Doctorate's in Nursing to become a Nurse Practitioner. Remember, the sky is not the limit... you are.

        <p>My story is simple. My story some may call typical. But to me, my story is special. Growing up in a broken home had to be one of the worst toughest things I went through as a child. But from that, I learned and I became much more mature and much stronger. This motivated me to find some happiness and to be successful in life. I had a passion and drive for knowledge and especially science. I have done well throughout my years in school and now starting this summer, I will begin my life journey starting at the University of South Florida in Tampa. I am beyond excited to see what my future holds. I am first in my family to go to college to receive my bachelors. I am first to really believe in myself. I am first.</p>

       <div class="copy co2"> 
        <p>The first thought that forms into my mind is my family. My biological family which will always be mine and the “foster” families with whom I struggled with. I am the second oldest child out of 8 half siblings. My mother is the bloodline which binds most of us together. As of late, I have not been as active in their lives as I once was due to the transition into new relationships and the investment in my future. I learned at a young age that life isn’t fair and you just have to accept it. If there was anything I could take from all I experienced, it would be refusing to be what others expect from my given circumstances. Refusing to be bitter from how others have treated me, refusing to fall into the footsteps of my parents and refusing to not accept any opportunities which will benefit me or become an individual I am comfortable with. Once my mother gave birth to her fifth child, my life became increasingly strained. Our family moved out and away from an abusive boyfriend, my favorite brother was taken away and eventually my family and I moved into a housing project. After watching my sister’s integration into the gang and drug life of the projects, and after my short journey on that same path, the trait which is described as resilience began to kick in. Although I was abused by friends and those who should have looked after me, and my mother continued her habits of hoarding and abusing prescription drugs while the house was ridden with animal feces and roaches, I continued investing in my individual path. Then, along came my youngest sister in the middle of facing eviction. My school attendance began to fail and I had to take on the responsibility of my mother. I cared for three young children while my mother was absent due to heavy medication, and the mess, our circumstances and the infestation of animals and insects became worse. Finally, the housing project just evicted us. An elderly couple from my church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, took me in. My life had seemed to change in a complete instant. However, the ugly truth was once again before me. I have absolutely no security, I am completely on my own. My current position, current situation, everything can be changed in an instant. Once I decided to expand my horizons and discover the world for myself, the fact that is my life presented itself. My path and the direction of where it could go was in the hands of the couple and I had no say or control of it myself. If I wanted to lead where it would go, I needed to take control and make an uncomfortable decision- to leave although the future was uncertain. All on my own. Feeling completely isolated and alone, I eventually became in contact with a school friend. She proved her friendship to me by stepping up and offering to let me live (for however long) with her. Although, once again, my life was changed in an instant. For about a year I was living with my friend. There were struggles; but as of October I was removed from the home. I was taken by social services and put into the system for a 24 hour period. I talked with girls who had stories similar to my own while I heard uncertainties of where I was going to be placed. Eventually, I was sent back to my mother. Regardless of the social worker’s obliviousness of the hell that awaited. Although I have new struggles that I currently face I am continuing to invest in my individual path. I am attending my final year of high school, applying to college and I have a job. Throughout all that has been my life and though the past catches up to me every once in a blue moon, it does not define who I am as an individual or the path I will lead. Through all the circumstances I have had to face, I stand above them, triumphant in not giving up.</p>

        <p>Once you've lived in a basement with your family which includes, you, your mother, your father and your newborn brother, you assume that your situation could not be any worse than it already is. Once you move into your first house, however, you start to realize something. The only way to go is up. So when you finally start high school, you\'re focused on moving up. Whether it's moving up the social ladder or just moving up to the next grade, you become dead set on achieving more and more. When the time comes for you to start college applications, it helps to think about what inspires you. Sometimes, you may not have the help of your family. Sometimes, they're the ones that are against you. But know one knows you better than yourself, and don\'t ever forget that. If you're an awful procrastinator, like myself, don\'t bite off more than you can chew. Pacing yourself is key. The last thing you want to do is stress yourself out. You've already got your grades to worry about, and we high schoolers know that our lives don't consist of only homework and the questionable cafeteria food. You've got a life too! When it comes to college applications, make sure you assess your family's financial situation. My family certainly didn't have the money for twenty college apps (not that I would have done that much anyway). I had to think within my means and I encourage other students to do that as well. I'm sure none of you want loans. Try visiting campuses to feel them out. Hint: the one for you feels the most like home. The key to being a trailblazer is knowing your own strengths and weaknesses. Focus on burning brighter, and keep going up no matter what!</p>

        <p>I had always thought going to college was out of the question, given my family\'s financial state and the fact that I had no idea what I was doing. But with help from my counselors and my advisers and especially my ROTC instructor, I found the courage to apply for multiple scholarships and to a few colleges. All of which I got accepted to because I was helped with my applications. So, with the right people helping, the right mentality, and enough persistence, you can do anything you want. All it takes is a little work and you got it!</p>

       <div class="copy co2"> 
        <p> I’m Thalia a Mexican-American born and raised in New York City. When I found out about the Evergreen State College, I knew in my heart that this was the place I wanted to pursue a higher education. I loved that Evergreen focused on interdisciplinary studies and would allow me to engage in social justice and environmental studies. When it was time to apply for colleges in high school I told my college advisor that I was going to apply to The Evergreen State College. She told me that I could not because of my family’s financial background. I did not have the resources to pay for an out of state tuition. Other college advisors thought I was crazy and said “You’re not rich”. It hurt me to hear them shut down my goals, especially because I knew I had to do the college process by myself as a first generation student. Soon, I got admitted to Evergreen. It was one of the greatest day to experience with my family. I told my therapist Maria who motivated me and my friends. But as a first generation student it was hard to plan because I did not have someone that went to college and give me guidance. In September 2014, I missed Evergreen’s scholars week because I was not awarded a financial package. I told my therapist Maria that I was not going to attend anymore. I still didn't have an airplane ticket to go to Washington State. I started thinking about how my college advisor in high school was right about how it would not be possible. I started looking at potentially attending a community college in New York City. I knew that everything I was doing did not feel right. I was thinking about my family’s financial needs and how it was going to affect my brothers in their future endeavors. On the week before orientation started it was September 17, 2014, my therapist Maria called to motivate me to still go to Evergreen. I felt that it was not possible because orientation week was going to start on September 20, 2014. I told her that I was planning on attending a community college. I was thinking about the future. I told myself that I should just go because this is what I was working for. I need to see and feel what is outside of New York City. I should go because this was what I really wanted and money does not determine what my heart longs for. So I decided the next day to take this opportunity. I decided to buy my first phone, open a credit card, and pack my luggage to leave home. When I got to The Evergreen State College it was hard because I didn't know where to go. As a first generation student it impacted me because I did not have anyone tell me what to expect. I met my RA and told her about my situation she took me to first people and went to Academic Advising during orientation week. From academic advising and financial aid, I got recommended to go as a part time student for two quarters. I was deciding that maybe I should just go back home. Being the first one to go to college from a low income family was hard to decide whether I should go part time as an out of state student. I was thinking about how gaining residency was going to be hard, especially being in a place I didn't know anyone. I didn't give up and now I’m here working on gaining residency as a part time first generation student for two quarters.</p>

        <p>I'm so excited to attend college! And being "The First" is a huge accomplishment for me. Before even knowing my parent's educational background I had my mind made up about continuing my education. There was no questions and no doubts. My father passed away when I was only 6 months and my mom works tirelessly to make sure that I have everything I need to be successful. They say parents provide for their children everything they didn't receive from their parents, but wanted. I can say that is true. Even though my mom doesn't pressure me to go to college she supports my decision 100%! Watching her do everything within her power to make my life better pushed me to desire to be great! Earning my degree will not only be one accomplishment that I can be proud of but it serves as a badge of honor for my mom too. My degree will show her that her hard work has paid off. She always says, "I'm raising you to be better than me." So earning a degree will say to her "job well done, mom!" and I can be proud of not only myself but her as well.</p>

        <p>College was my chance to catch up. I didn't feel prepared to go to a four-year college when I graduated high school. Neither of my parents had gone to college. They immigrated from Mexico and beyond offering encouragement and making it clear that they wanted me to have a good education, they weren't able to help with the college application process. More often than not, I helped them navigate important programs and fill-out forms. I was also afraid that because my high school had really low test-scores and had only recently started offering AP classes, that I would get to college and wouldn't be as well prepared as other students. So I decided to start at a two-year college, take core classes, improve my study skills, and be in a safe place to make mistakes. I made a lot of mistakes, turning-in assignments late, putting too many classes on my schedule, and trying to take classes with easy instructors instead of concentrating on learning the material. I even failed a class, but after each stumble I got up and thought about what had gone wrong, and how I could improve, so that I wouldn't repeat my error. I kept making progress. I found that that was a pretty good system, and after a while I realized that I had actually sold myself short and that I was doing better than I thought. I transferred to the best school in the state and realized that even there, among kids that I thought were way smarter than me, I could hold my own. I made great friends, took on a second major, graduated with honors, and I was first in my family to graduate from high school.</p>

        <p>My mother had me when she was 23-she took care of me and her extended family at an age when single people her age are out enjoying their young lives. I was born in Cali, Colombia, one of the most dangerous and impoverished cities in the world. At a very young age, I knew we did not have much. I remember being hungry and wishing there was more food. I overheard many discussions about the need for money. I did not know exactly how money would fix things, but I did know that money was what we needed. One day, with good news from the Embassy, we traveled to the United States with the hopes of a new future. We were on American soil facing the same challenges we faced in Colombia, but in a new country far away from the familiarity afforded by our family. This was scary and uncertain, but I remained hopeful. In the U.S., we rented a one-room basement apartment with a lonely single bed. Our car was a white Toyota van resembling something out of Scooby Doo. This car represented me on my journey. It never worked perfectly, it was not eye-catching, but nonetheless, it was the most valuable item we owned. We kept multiple jugs of water on hand to cool it off when it broke down. Similarly, my mother often reminded me that I, too, was valuable, and I never doubted her love and encouragement. Nevertheless, society never failed to remind me of my imperfections and the prejudices that would serve to influence my performance academically and socially. I did not speak English well, and I was looked at as a double minority-Hispanic and female. Where I come from in Colombia, women are discouraged from having aspirations and goals beyond caring for their family. My struggle was to steer myself away from the road I was expected to travel because I knew that I would have to rewrite this journey if I wanted a life different from the one I was born into. This car has encountered several roadblocks along the way yet has still managed to keep moving forward. I am that car, with all of its flaws, but still with the potential to persevere. The jugs of water represent the people who were there to "fix" what could have potentially derailed me from achieving my goals. One of those special people was Dr. Kagan. During my sophomore year, the science fair had just been removed from the biology curriculum. This posed a significant roadblock, as I had no other means to complete the science fair project I started in ninth grade. Unlike most of my classmates, I was eager to see my project to completion. I approached one of the AP Biology teachers, Dr. Kagan, and asked if he would mentor me. Initially he was confused that someone would want to participate in the Science Fair for fun, but then gladly supported me. Dr. Kagan had just cooled off my overheated car. I stayed after school to culture bacteria, and slowly saw my project come alive. Now my car was speeding down the road and soon, I was competing in the Regional Science Fair where I presented my research and earned the opportunity to display my ideas and hard work. I went on to win the Young Aspiring Scientist Award as the only underclassmen to participate in the Science Fair at my school. This event represents one of many moments in my life when I have had to overcome roadblocks. Despite the challenges and times I felt defeated, I have been able to push myself to new limits with the help of people like my mother and Dr. Kagan. I am determined to keep my car moving by breaking the cycle of poverty, giving back to my community, and becoming the first college graduate in my family.</p>

        <p>True to college. True to you. Many people say that senior year is the best year of high school. Well, it is if you make it. My experience has made me realize so much of what many may not know about the college process. By being the first-generation to go to college I didn't know what to do, what to look out for, what to expect. I always hear about my friends applying to prestigious schools and I get discouraged by it because those friends know what they are doing. I don't. But who cares? They have their own road and I have my own. That is something I want everyone to recognize during their college process. Do not worry about what other people are doing, just know what you value and don't let anyone talk you out of it. For my college career, I wanted to do public health and be in a small school. However, many of the schools that offer what I want in college are out-of-state...When I told everyone, they flipped out. It was not common to have someone go out of state where I lived. Other people couldn't understand why I chose to go out of state. They would always convince me and give me long speeches about how much better it would be for me to stay in state. For months, I battled with myself mentally between what I want and what my friends, family, and counselors wanted. And in the end I never backed down on my decision to apply out-of-state. And guess what? I feel 100% happy and confident about my decision, because it is my future that I am planning. In the end, you should too. Don't let anyone tell you what to choose, especially for college. Do what you believe is best for you and your future.</p>

        <p>College is about more than just classes, but as a first-generation student, I didn't know that until I felt supported by staff members and started getting involved on campus. Struggling to find all the answers sure builds character and self-authorship but there are many people that can help along the way! Being first-gen can be tough, but it can also lead you to rewarding relationships and accomplishments.</p>

All I had ever wanted in life was to be like my mom and be was a wife and mother. I choose to go back to school after my marriage of ten years ended I realized I needed to find a way to support my family. Another reason I wanted to go back to school was to show my girls that they can do or be anyone they want to be the skies the limit as long as they believe in themselves. Going back to school has not always been easy but it has been well worth the time it has taken me. In January 2014 I will start Arkansas Tech University I will graduate in May of 2016 with my Bachelor’s Degree in Early Childhood Education. I hope my testimony will help some other first time student to reach for the stares and get a college education.</p>

I attended and graduated from DeVry University with the support of my family and friends, particularly my mother, whose support was unwavering. Seek out your network of support because you'll need it in those times that you may want to give up. College may be daunting at times but it is worth the hard work and effort you will put into it.

This program allows you to concurrently enroll at either Dixie State University or Southern Utah University. You can finish high school, start college, and graduate with your Associate's degree and not have to pay tuition (or room and board)! Naturally I signed up and now, in my senior year, I know it was the way to go! I am ahead of other high school seniors and I have made myself and my family proud!</p>

When you are that young hearing that news it would tear most couples apart. Not my parents, they looked into options and one was adoption, a very expensive option but one that never worried about. Both my parents set aside their school plans and took the education they earned and worked hard to not only adopt me, from Korea also my brother from Texas. So I need not even say how much it means to me to be the first generation graduate.</p>

        <p>Hello everyone. My name is Frantasia Hampton and I graduated from CICS Ralph Ellison High School Saturday June 8, 2013. If you are the first person in your family to go to college then you should finish. It is really important for you to have the highest form of education possible in order for you to go far in life. Don't think that it's over because you graduated out of high school the road of success is just beginning. I was always told that I will always have obstacles but its up to me to get past them and succeed in life. My parents always shared things with me such as telling me nothing is ever going to be given to you, you have to work for it. Anything you put your mind to, you will succeed at it. In the fall of 2013 I will be attending Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi. My journey is just beginning and I will be the first to graduate out of college and become successful. No matter what people have to say about you prove them wrong and stay on the right path and you will be The First.</p>

        <p>I didn't think that my dream could become reality until my mentor, the Career Center Coordinator encouraged me, pushed me to apply. I was scared to apply to such expensive colleges but she asked me to trust her and apply for financial aid. I couldn't believe that I was admitted to the University of Southern California with a Cacique Scholar Award. It was a tough road ahead and I doubted my intelligence and thought maybe I wasn't the type (too poor) of person who should be in college. I realized that I had chosen an excellent University but did not do the research to find the best fit for me. I decided to transfer and when I visited Saint Mary’s College of California, I fell in love with the school. Now I understand how important it is to find the right environment to be happy and successful in college. I have found my vocation as a College Counselor as I get to support students realize their college dreams.</p>

My mother was a high school drop out and my father is a military veteran. Although they never attend a traditional 4 year college, they knew the importance of their children receiving that education and have encouraged me and my brother throughout our childhood to do the best we could in school and to realize that their sacrifices were so we could be successful in our lives. My hope is that my parents feel their hard work and encouragement for me is a success in their own lives and a reward greater than a degree.</p>

At age six I moved to the US and brought my passion for soccer with me. However, I soon developed an even greater passion – my faith in God and confidence that I can achieve anything as long as I set Him as a priority. I am the first in my family to attend college, and my complicated path to US citizenship has made this especially challenging. Hard work and my passion for soccer have provided opportunities for me, but it is my faith that brought me to this point.

I graduated May 20, 2013 and i was the first to complete high school as well. Neither of my parents ever made it to high school. My dad was incarcerated all of my life and my mother was on drugs. I did everything i could to be better then my parents and set the example they should have. I want to give myself the life i want and deserve without struggling. Someone once said that if you go confidently in the direction of your dreams then you can live the life you have imagined. That was the best advice ever because it helped me through my hard times. Going to college is the best decision anyone could make because it is a gate to better yourself and give ones loved ones a better life as well.</p>

        <p>My family have always tried to attend college but our financial situation have always stop each member of my family to attend college. My brother had to step put to help my family when he finish High school and my parents just didn't have no choice but to help their family as well. As the youngest son I'm the last chance for this family to attend college in the first time track. I have being accepted to UCSC and i have got some scholarships and right now i have a gap of $5,000 to attend college, I'm so close to be able to attend college but also to far. Besides being the last chance of this family to attend college, i have always dream about living in a campus and meet new people and to be able to work in the carrier that i want. My parents have made a lot of sacrifices as well as i have by forcing my self to take 3 AP classes and 2 Honors, it would be a shame that i won't be able to attend college for only $5,000 that my family can't afford.</p>

        <p>vGrowing up in a not so great neighborhood Growing up with unstable income family in a far from great neighborhood fueled my aspirations of providing a better for the family I would have. To live out my dreams, I would need to receive a degree from a higher education and start a career. I am the first person in my family to attend college, let alone a 4 year university. Being the first means my parents and I got a chance to experience major financial problems leaving me with a frightening feeling that I may not be able to finish college. This is my chance at life, my one shot to take this nothingness and turn it into something great.</p>

        <p>I was born to Brazilian immigrants: my mother, a Pan-American judo champion, and my father, a second division soccer player. With an insatiable desire to fulfill their potential, my parents were driven to the “land of opportunity”. Inasmuch as they had dreamed of succeeding in America, they longed to create a family. First came my brother, Kyle, whom I later joined. Under the love of my brother, the tenderness of my mother, and the protection of my father, I flourished. The experience of growing up with my childhood partner, my blood, my brother created between us a sense of companionship. Kyle was my object of inspiration, of admiration, and of a deep love. As I was sailing through the ninth grade, a violent wave of misfortune struck and capsized my boat. My treasured brother began to develop schizophrenia. Feeling defenseless, I reacted with utter and complete numbness. However, this feeling of helplessness propelled me to search for ways to restore my brother. I knew that I could use my own life to benefit people to an infinite degree.</p>

        <p>Who is Will McCorkle? In many ways that is easy to answer. I’m the son of a strong single mother, a self-motivated student, an athlete who has a huge passion for basketball, and an individual with a hard drive for success. People tell me I have a lot of heart but let’s leave my height out of this because I’m not exactly the tallest person around. I strive to create and accomplish alternate expectations for myself. When people first meet me they see a handsome, well-mannered young man with a nice smile who likes to joke a lot; but many don’t know what takes place behind the smile and good character. To hear about my background, many people might be surprised that I am writing a college essay at all. I come from a family of five siblings and a single mother. My dad has been incarcerated since I was three years old so I never really had a close relationship with him. Reminiscing back on my childhood I realized the older we got, the tougher times were for us. I began to understand that my siblings were involved in the wrong activities. My brother was in and out of prison and my sisters were in and out of trouble. The wrong decisions they made affected all of us, including my mother. She would have to pay large amounts of lawyer fees and work overtime or more than one job in order to support us all. To this day I don’t know how she does it. My family are great people but everyone makes mistakes. I've been watching their mistakes for years and they've helped mold me into the wise and positive human being I am today. Seeing my mother struggle influenced me to become more independent and tactical by creating ways to support myself. Before I got a real job, I spent time cutting grass and shoveling snow in the winter. I also swept hair off the floor at my barbershop. The first real job I had was with my school, and then I was hired to work at a local food store. I had to grow up faster than the average kid because nothing has ever been given to me. I have to go out and get things myself. It was tough because it got overwhelming but I've learned from it. Many people don’t know how it feels to not have anything and have to work for everything they earn. Through the years, I developed the ability to stay strong and keep a smile through my experience. It was difficult at times but my challenge has made me into the person I am today so I appreciate all that I've been through. You never know how strong you really are until strength is your only option. I've worked to alter my disadvantages into my advantages and as I look forward to college, I’m much more focused and wiser than before. Going to college is significant to me because I’ll be the first in family to go and I know that it will better my circumstances.</p>

My plan for the following months are to go to Moraine Valley Community College and take classes of Mechanical Design to become a Mechanical Engineer. Since I was seven, my dream was to invent and design. The obstacle holding me back of entering college is currency. Over the past months I have been trying to find a job to pay for college, but unfortunately I have had no luck. I have applied for various scholarships and have had not much luck, but thanks for district 218 and their staff, they have gave me a generous amount of money, but I still hope to find more scholarships to increase my education level and accomplish my dreams.</p>

I want to set an example for my younger brother and set the standard for future generations in my family. I know college will be a challenge, but being the first to finish is a bigger challenge that I plan on conquering. I already see myself with my college degree and this vision is fuel to stay in the race. it will be an honor to be the first, and I know I can do it with the support from my parents who always stress the importance of getting a college education.</p>

        <p>During the time that I've lived in Jamaica I've been getting depressed over the fact that my mom has always said to me that She has never attended college nor high school because she started working since she was 12. She has been working to make ends meet to help her mom. And because of her hard work and dedication to her family she tells me that she is doing everything she posible can to help me to go to college and get a good education. Whenever I hear her talk about her struggling life it just makes me more and more eager to go to college and make something out of myself to make her proud and so I can get a great job and take care of her because she had to take care of her family her own life. She is now 52 year's old and everyday she tells me her story over and over again. She doesn't tell me her story to scare me she tells me her story to encourage to do better than what she had done and to make her proud and even though I can't afford to go to Southern Connecticut State University in Connecticut I know that if i stay determine and dedicated like my mom i will make it there one day. Never give up on your dreams no matter what the circumstances might be and never lose hope of what really matters: family, positive friends and strangers who encourage and influence you to do well. Always aim for the stars because in the end it will reflect on you. I am now a Junior at Central High School in Bridgeport, Connecticut and I will be graduating next year and so could you. Thank you for listening to my story and I hope I touched at least one life today :)</p>

The only way to do that is through a good education.

        <p>I have noticed all my life that my mom and family didn’t live up to what they have told me about getting a better education. Every one of them had different experience obviously, but they all left school. Some left because they didn’t like school. There were also a few who became pregnant or just because there wasn’t money to pay for school. To me these are not good excuses to drop out of school, but it’s my motivation so I don’t end up making the same mistakes as they did. The whole feeling of being the first to go to college in my family makes me feel good, proud, and happy to know I will make a better person out of myself. My family has always been my motivation to continue. Now I know that they are just as proud of me as I am of myself.</p>

He would even have to walk for miles just to use electricity. After finishing high school, my father was able to learn mechanics and after showing promise, he secured a small job fixing engines and overtime he gained a good reputation and got the rare opportunity to go to the U.S. on a visa; however, he couldn’t attend college. My mother grew up in the working class and was fortunate enough to be accepted into college. Shortly after she began, she was stricken with an illness that debilitated her, inhibiting her from finishing college. Though lacking degrees, they were able to give me opportunities and now that I am going to college, I am hoping that I won't similarly be held back.</p>

        <p>Have you ever wanted to break the lines of your family tradition? I know, I do. In my family, no one has never taken on the challenge of college because of the tremendous financial burden. Born and raised in Guyana, survival is more of a realistic thing rather than getting a higher education. I think that you should never back down on what your dreams are despite of the money. If you want to pursue a college degree, go for it. College means a lot to me because I want to do something better in life, I want to be different and finally be able to help my family out of poverty. After my father died, we moved to America in search of better life. My mother works overtime for minimum wage and this why she inspires me everyday to keep on going. She has helped me all along and someday, I will walk across that stage and make her proud.</p>

        <p>I have evolved from an impoverished youth to a successful college graduate pursuing a graduate degree in early childhood education. Through my involvement in T.E.A.M AmeriCorps I have served at Woodson Elementary, KIPP Ways Middle School, Frederick Douglass High School, The Martin Luther King Center For Non Violence. I engaged students with Shel Silversein for Carver Middle's Reel Men Read Service Day. Now I am attempting to pursue a masters in Early Childhood Education at Georgia State University. My only issue is funding my education. I have been accepted, but it is unfortunate how the amount of money one ones dictates the level of education they attain. My accelerated program begins on May, 6, and I am confident I will make things work in some way. There were times in my life where I felt like the world was out to get me. I was the laughing stock of Avondale Middle School. I remember I was once made to perform push-ups in front of the entire gym. I also enhanced my physical abilities while joining Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Inc. This service organization offered a great philosophy of life tied to community service. I have completed over 1000 community service hours with AmeriCorps thus far!</p>

        <p>In a world of IB, AP, and honor students, the average B scholar has a hard time standing out. Not all learners are gifted and advanced. Not all college graduates started their freshman semester with dual credits earned in high school. However, someone must have realized that in a world of overachievers, there are good students whom also long for a chance at a higher education; who also have a desire to be a contributing asset to their community one day. Through grade and middle school, I have always scored highly. This feat has continuously placed me on the Honor Roll. At the high school freshman orientation four years ago, I heard an advisor say, "Ninth graders need to hit the ground running." Knowing this meant that I must study, apply myself, and not make choices that would affect my hope of attending college one day in the near future. High school demands quickly reminded me that I must stay focused and not waiver. Learning a new language, Spanish, proved to be quite a challenge. I needed extra assistance from my teachers in this area many times; meeting with them before school. The study of a foreign language is a college admission requirement; therefore, I also sought the support of my father who is bilingual as well as tutoring from the teaching staff. Success this subject proved to be a difficult barrier that I feared may endanger my admittance to college. With much perseverance, I completed the four semesters successfully even though it required six semesters to do so. The first semester of my senior year ended with me earning a 3.4 GPA. Due to my struggle in Spanish, my cumulative GPA is a 3.1. Happily, I am ending my journey of high school strong with a 4.0. I have been involved in the Los Angeles County 4H program throughout my education as an extra curricular activity. Through 4H, I have served my community by participating in fundraising efforts that benefit my local town and club. For example, I have served by cleaning up our local Leona Valley Heritage Park for the Memorial Day Service that honors veterans and community members who were instrumental in 4H. In addition, I gathered dog care products and sent them to Iraq for U.S. Soldiers to use for their K-9 counterparts. Senator George Runner recognized this effort by presenting my club with a recognition certificate and an American flag that was flown in Iraq in our honor. I have also raised and managed a livestock/market swine project; where I have competed at the Antelope Valley Fair for eight years. In the capacity of teen leader, I have guided other members in the project with choosing an animal and building pens. Also, as the teen leader, I have taught the other exhibitors how to properly weigh, manage feeding, and ethically raise show quality market hogs. In giving of myself to others, I have contributed over one-hundred hours in service to other youth. At the Antelope Valley Fair, I spend close to ten hours annually, educating the public that visit the swine barn, about raising market hogs for consumption. They are often in awe that youth have taken a stand on ethically raising and selling hormone free organic pork as an extracurricular activity. I am also a varsity swimmer, at Quartz Hill High School where we have been awarded league champions for the last three years. Spending fifteen hours in the pool a week has kept my body strong and my mind clear. Through my experience as a swimmer and my familiarity with the water, I have pursued the certification in life saving techniques, CPR, and first aid. I have an excellent work ethic and have proven myself through years of volunteering with 4H and the high school swim team club. Since I was a young boy, I have never spent a summer or school break in an idle activity. I have always persuaded a local farmer or elderly person to allow me to work in their orchard or yard performing manual labor or other duties. In addition, I have conducted myself professionally in order to seek employment as a lifeguard. I hope to continue to use that knowledge to prolong my ability to serve others. I have chosen to apply to three state colleges all of which have accepted me as a perspective university student for the fall of 2013. My mother attended a community college, but didn't complete the degree requirements. That shortcoming has constantly been a regret of hers that I don't want to experience myself. I will therefore be a first generation university student. In addition, I am motivated to secure a place in the professional world and the only pathway there is through a college degree. I am an avid outdoorsman and would like to pursue a career as a fish and game warden. Having the ability to study fisheries biology or forestry ecology and wildlife management is a dream of mine that I refuse to see go down stream. This journey is a dream of mine that was not fiscally planned for. Consequently, any scholarship monies that I potentially am awarded will be received with the utmost of gratitude for I am forced to rely on student loans to fund my education.</p>

To all students who want to be the first generation in their family to go to college.I have to say go for it.College is a great way to study your craft and make new experiences,while earning a degree for a brighter future and making your family proud. Also you going to college might inspire passed and future generations to go college or even finish school or to better their eduction. For me personally college means having a brighter future which allows me to support myself and being able to make my parents proud that I worked hard enough to reach my goal. There were a lot of important people who helped me along the way. Besides my teachers the most important people to help me was my mother, who made me promise I would go to college no matter what and my older sister,who constantly drove me back and forth to meetings for different colleges and paid for fees .In all I'm ecstatic to be the first generation in my family to go to college. I plan to work hard and in four years earn a bachelor's degree in Mass Communication and a minor in film production.</p>

ALL HER LIFE SHE TRIED TO ATTEND COLLEGE BUT COULD NEVER SEEM TO MAKE IT HAPPEN, DUE TO SOME BAD DECISION SHE MADE THROUGHOUT LIFE, BUT SHE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT SHE ADVISED ME TO BE DIFFERENT. IN DOING SO, SHE USED HERSELF AS AN EXAMPLE. SHE TOLD ME THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE TO STRUGGLE LIKE HER. SHE ADVISED ME THAT JUST TRYING TO PAY ONES EVERY DAY LIVING EXPENSES IS COMPLICATED. I'VE SEEN HER HAVE TO SACRIFICE MOST OF THE TIME, TO ENSURE THAT MY LIFE WAS COMFORTABLE.

        <p>Through the closed bedroom door, I heard my name being mentioned in the other room. I stepped out of the bedroom and walked half way down the hall; the muffled voices had escalated into loud shouting. My parents were stressed out, worried about what more they could do to get money to sustain the family. "The rent keeps going up," my mother cried with sadness in her voice. Cloth was wrapped around her leg to prevent any further bleeding from the wound that the accident at the sweatshop had caused. "I can't work, not with this injured knee," she said through her tears. My father knelt down to comfort her, ending their loud discussion. "We'll find a way to get money," he whispered into her ear. Unseen behind a door, I watched them for a moment, feeling as if I was going to burst into tears. I could not stand seeing them so upset over our unpaid bills. My father worked hard at his minimum wage job, and my unemployed mother tried to find ways of obtaining money by asking friends. Despite their hard work, they still could not make ends meet. My heart was breaking because I knew I could not do anything to fix our situation. I felt powerless; I wanted my family to get out of this desperate situation. Since that night, two weeks after my 13th birthday, I began to value my education. I could have made other choices growing up. Both of my parents are alcoholics. Although they try to be good parents through their love and support, their addiction prevents them from getting out of their impoverished situation. I chose to do well in school and took a different path than my parents and brother. I now see education as my ticket out of poverty and the opportunity for a meaningful career. That is why I am always on top of my schoolwork, taking AP classes to challenge myself academically. I always push myself to do well in every class by completing every single assignment, and studying for all my exams. I also completed any work that I missed because of an occasional illness or a family emergency. I even took two community college classes in Sociology and Spanish 2 to expose myself to a higher level of academics, and it was thrilling because I gained valuable insights on career paths such as sociology. I feel that every minute I spend on my education is an investment in my future, and investment that will bring me closer to achieving my goal of understanding why my parents and older brother solicit drugs knowing that it ruins lives. As a child my oldest sister encouraged me to make wise choices. She would tell me, "You are who you are because of your choices, not the labels that others put upon you." She said this when I told her the kids at my middle school were pressuring me to "be cool" by ditching class and smoking cigarettes. Growing up, she helped me cope with my problems at home. She has helped me realize that the world did not revolve around my life, and that in order to help others, I must first help myself by going to college. I am a dedicated scholar motivated to graduate from university, to grow personally and professionally, and to inspire others in my community the way my sister inspired me.</p>

My mom had attended one year at Beal College after she graduated, I think it was only a one year program so I feel like I was the first one to actually graduate with a four-year degree from UMF in 1996. I have an Early Childhood degree and currently work as as ELL Ed Tech III at Montello Elementary School in Lewiston, ME. UB was an amazing experience for me. I was from a small town, Deer Isle and was very shy and introverted. UB helped me to see the potential that they saw in me and gave me the courage to believe in myself, that I could actually attend college and graduate with a degree that would help me in the future, mainly to help me get off of Deer Isle and do something with my life! I am happily married, almost 18 years to my high school sweetheart and we live in our own mobile home in Lewiston. We are both in education and are very happy. UB left lasting memories and friendships that I still hold dear to my heart 20 years later.</p>

        <p>I come from a hispanic background no one in my family has ever gone to college. I hope to be the first to notnonly attend college but also graduate. I plan on being the one my little cousins, nieces, and nephews look up to. It's hard though coming from a low income neighborhood all that was expected from me was to end up pregnant, but I don't want that for myself I know I can do better and I will.</p>

        <p>Palomar College Upward Bound (UB) is a non-profit program that provides high school guidance counseling and mentorship for academically at-risk, low-income, and first-generation students between 9th and 12th grade. Our work goes beyond just attempting to aid these students reach a 4-year university, we are focused upon instilling a sense of accomplishment and pride in overcoming and achieving their goals while being beset by a number of barriers and being the first in their families to pursue a Bachelorâ€™s degree. Having the ability to help these young individuals reach their full potential and being able to see the passion that these young scholars demonstrate is enough for anyone to see how amazing the UB program is, and the families that have dedicated so much to us. Striving to reach our goals and the goals of our students, the Upward Bound program bases our foundation upon our Students Creed: From this day forward, I sincerely promise I will seek to be a better scholar. I will pursue my academics with a passion for excellence and practical strategies for improvement. I will always be a positive example for all other students to follow. I shall never do anything that would bring disgrace or dishonor upon my school, community, the Upward Bound program, my parents, and family or me. My education will be my first priority and my planning for college will be uppermost in my thoughts and actions. These pledges I will honor and respect in a manner that will reflect credit upon them and ultimate success for me. I commit to these principles as an Upward Bound student and future college scholar.</p>

        <p>At first, college was a way to make my parents, who had me as teenagers, proud. Then it became a way to prove teenage parent statistics wrong. In the end, it became a way to challenge myself. A foot in the higher education door led me to a bachelor's degree, numerous internships, a semester abroad and a master's degree. Not having someone to relate to made the beginning of the journey difficult, but my parent's support and encouragement made me push myself into things I never imagined doing on the very first day as a college student. Dreams turned into actions and those actions turned into success. I won't say that it was an easy ride, but it was more of a well-worth it type of ride. Keep your eye on what you want to accomplish and you will succeed as a first generation college student.</p>

        <p>I am a first generation college student attending Pittsburg State University. Being a first generation college student has empowered me to do the best i can do not only in school but as a leader on campus. I am heavily involved on campus. Being involved gives me a support group, a sense of family, relating to college. As a first generation college student i felt isolated in the beginning. Nobody i knew had ever gone to college and i felt like nobody could relate to my problems. So my advice to first generation college students is get involved create a "family" within your campus, when you feel like you belong you are more likely to succeed. You're not alone!</p>

For generations, in both sides of my family, no one went to college, so going seemed like something I would definitely be proud of. Now I'm in my junior year of high school and am dual enrolling at a local community college. Everyone is very proud of me and I am very proud of myself. Just because my parents didn't go to college, and their parents didn't go, and so on, doesn't mean that I am limited. I plan on being the person who takes the chains off of my family, and teaches future generations that college is not only important but achievable.</p>

Today, I am a counselor for the program and help first generation students achieve their degrees. The work I do is rewarding and is a way for me to pay it forward every day. Being a first generation college student can be frightening and intimidating but you cannot discover the dream unless you strive forward. My parents did whatever they could to keep me on the path of getting a college education. I knew not going to college was not an option for me. The process can be intimidating but you cannot let it stop you. The most important part of the process is to ask questions (lots of questions) and don't take no for an answer. If you don't get an answer be persistent and challenge yourself. Step out of you comfort zone and try new things you might discover something new. Always look at every obstacle as a new opportunity for you to grow and become one step closer to your goal. Envision the goal and then make the plan to get there and you will get there sooner than you think!</p>

        <p>I come from a family of immigrants and I will be the first in my famliy to attend a university. I am very excited to go to college and i have always done my best in school because of all the hard my parents have done for our family to provide food and shelter for us. They also immigrated to the United States from Mexico because they were thinking of their kid's future. This has kept me motivated because I want to make my parents proud and also prove to myself that I am capable of graduating from college with a Bachelor's degree in Nutrition and Dietetics. I Applied to a couple of universities, but the school i applied to and I really want to go to is CSU Long Beach. So if all goes well and i get accepted I will be attending this university starting in fall 2013. College is at the reach of your hands, all you have to do is work hard and truly want a better future for yourself and future family.</p>

        <p>My name is Abel and I am an aspiring first generation college student. I just want to tell the students who want to be the first generation in their family to go to college to never give up. I believe that college is the path to a successful life. It will lead you to a good job/career, nice house, etc. I've been receiving tons of advice from counselors, teachers, and especially my parents. My parents were not four-year college graduates and that is why I want to make a change by going to college and to successfully graduate. My dad has helped me along the way. He is from Ethiopia, located in Africa. He is a huge endorsement towards my education and I understand his financial adversity. To the students, please respect and get in contact with your parents because they have came a long way trying to raise you. I know my parents did. Continue to try your best and persevere because in the end, you make the decision on what's best for you.</p>

        <p>Hi my name is Krysten, I am 17 years of age and I am currently enrolled to attend Hampshire College in the fall of 2013. Although my parents never attended college the always expressed the concern amd value of higher education. With those values I have always strived for the best in school. From a young child I have always wanted to be a neurosurgeon and the only way to achieve that goal is through college. I feel that if someone is unsure of what career path they want to pursue in life college allows you to experience any profession you chose. While searching for a school I had to factor many things about my personal life as well including my morals and values. The three major aspects of college that can be the most difficult, overwhelming and even stressful are the application process, physically leaving away from home and the financial cost. There are many parts to the application process and you must complete them all to have your application reviewed by your chosen school. I thought at times I was finished with my application but I still had more papers to submit. The best advice I can offer people when it comes to the application process is ask questions ask questions ask questions. If you don't understand something ask your high school guidance councilor, ask your chosen school's dean of admissions. That is what they are there for to help you out over this long process. Another aspect that intemidate a lot of people is the financial burden. I am here to tell you that there is money out there. I know that the money is what scared me the most but I was still able to attend to school I wanted to because of scholarship from the school and outside of the school. Trust me there is money out there and with hardwork and determination you can find it. I have always lived with my mom and this will be the first time I will be living 600 plus miles away from home and that has me nervous and excited. I get to meet new people and experience new things in life and that's great but there's key thing is time and money management there's no one telling you what time to go to bed and what time to get up you have to do all these things on your own but it is possible. College is obtainable for everyone and being a first generation college student and the eldist sibling in my household I set an example for my younger sisters and brother. The need to know that they can do anything if they put their mind to it and I'm showing them that. </p>

        <p>As the oldest of 3 children, there's a much greater pressure on me to succeed. And that means going to college. I had quite the fiasco these past 4 years, trying to keep my grades up while still enjoying the extracurriculars (Select Choir, Jazz Choir, and an a-cappella group that I direct called 2beats), that I almost got myself physically ill and incapable. So my advice (and I'm bad at this, but here goes): Work hard, but not too hard that you drain yourself. Have fun. Loosen up. Success will not even attempt to enter a closed mind or heart.</p>

I am currently caught up with my classes and credits. Actually, I'm a bit ahead. People talk about their parents and grandparents being alumni from their dream college, but I am out to start my own traditions, starting with my college degree, and being the first in my family to have one.</p>

There is no reason to forego college; even if the funds are not available at the moment, there are opportunities to fulfill monetary needs.

He does not want me to work in life, but he wants me to have an education for me to work without using my body. I learned from him to make the best of my life, so college is where I need to go to accomplish my goal to be a computer engineer: only requires an educated brain.</p>

        <p>Both of my parents graduated from high school in the late 1950's. My father enlisted in the Navy as soon as he graduated and my mother began having children. My father stayed in the Navy for 20 years and retired in 1979 and started his own machine shop business. My mother never worked when my brother and sister's were young but started work in the retail business after my parents divorced in 1972. I mention this because growing up, we never talked about going to college. It was never an option for my parents and didn't seem like an option for me. I was a very good student in school and always made the A/B honor roll throughout high school. I wanted to be a teacher ever since I was a little girl but never thought it could happen. During my senior year of high school, I was called down to the guidance office to talk with my counselor. I had never talked to a counselor before in my life. She asked me why I had not taken the SAT exam and I told her that I did not know what that was. She explained that it was an entrance exam for college and that I needed it so that I could be eligible to go to college. I told her that I wasn't going to college because we were poor and had no way to pay for it. She told me that I could qualify for grant money because of my family income and that I absolutely must take the test. I completed the application and she got someone to pay the fee for me. I showed up at my high school on a Saturday morning and took a test that I had never studied for nor did I have a clue what it was about. About a month later, I got the results and they were good enough to get accepted to college. She had me fill out an application for financial aid and my mom and I completed it together. I applied to one college, a private college in my city because my best friend's mom was an instructor there. I got accepted and had a grant to pay my entire tuition and books. Well to make a long story short, I quit three times. I had transferred to a junior college and received my AA degree and then went to one of our state universities where I received my bachelor's degree in education. I struggled to stay in school because I hadn't prepared for the challenge. I continued my college and received a master's degree after teaching for 10 years. Today I am a principal in the largest middle school in my town (1500 students). I never thought this would be my life but I am thankful for that counselor who would not take no for an answer.</p>

It's a great feeling to know that you're making a difference in the world whether you see or not.

It's a once in a life time experience filled with stories, fun and memories you'll never forget. Go to college! Make a difference!

        <p>I grew up watching my young, single mother work hard to support me and my grandparents are still up by 4am every day to work the jobs not many can do at their age. College is more than an education to me; it's honoring the hard work of my family and fulfilling their dreams of a better future. Illinois Wesleyan has provided me with the skill set and opportunities to succeed. I have become a stronger, wiser person and am living proof that college is possible; we have to take advantage of the opportunities our parents and grandparents never had.</p>

        <p>I'm Dedra and I'm First! I'm a first generation college student from Enid, Oklahoma. I am attending Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. I have been blessed through out my 20 years of life. Going to college and furthering my education is the one thing I thank God for every day. My life can be pretty hectic some times but, now that I am getting a higher education, I know it will lighten the burdens I may have in future years. I have been pushed hard throughout my three years in school to get the best grades possible. I try my hardest for my Mom because she has helped put me here. She is my number one supporter and without her I do not know where I would be right now. Once, I graduate I would like to teach anywhere or anything. I just want my students to learn as much as I did in my primary years of schooling and know that there is a bigger and better world out there. They will have to learn that life isn't always easy; I will be there to support them like me teachers have done for me.</p>

        <p>I'm Cynthia and I'm first. Sometimes it is not so much about wanting to be the first in your family, it is about knowing that it is something that you HAVE to do in order to prove people wrong, or make a better example for the kids in your family who come after, or help your family financially, or to expand your world of possibilities. For me, it was all of the above. Coming from a Salvadoran immigrant family, first generation born in the U.S., and youngest of four children - I had an early understanding of the challenges that people face. My parents worked two jobs, my sisters were teen parents, my brother was a drug addict - I had two cultures and two languages to navigate and low-income realities that made a lot of opportunities seem distant. Regardless of what your situation is as a first, you probably have your own set of challenges - but rather than letting this be an excuse, embrace your personal story and make it your motivation to move forward. Regardless of the societal labels that you are born into, ANYONE CAN DO IT! Find supportive adults and programs (because they do exist), ask questions, spend that extra time doing research and don't be afraid to make the leap into college even if you still don't know "what you want to be when you grow up". Heck, I'm 30 and still don't know what I want to be "when I grow up!" (Not a lot of people do!) College is a step towards getting an economically viable career - it is not as scary as people make it seem - plus, if you hated high school as much as I did, you will see that College is much more interesting and has so much more freedom. As a first, I now have had a chance to see the young ones that came after me helping end the cycle of low-educational attainment in my family. My eldest niece just graduated college and my second niece is in her first year of community college. As a first, I see how much having a college degree and graduate degree has helped my entire family and allowed me to experience people, places and things I never had imagined. Study hard, get involved in extra curricular activities and be the first. If you didn't do so well in high school, you can STILL be the first. No matter how long it takes - trust me, you will reap the benefits of the sacrifice and so will your loved ones. Ahora, hecha pa'lante que no hay nada pa'tras! (Now, move forward cause there is nothing in turning back!) Good luck and I look forward to you joining me at the table of firsts that are helping pave the way for future generations to come.</p>

        <p>I’m Ashley and I’m first. I am attending Illinois Wesleyan University. When I was 11 years old, I was placed by Division of Family Services, aka foster care. I was in the foster home for 6 months and then moved in with family. You could say growing up was tricky. But I made it. I didn’t want to follow the statistics about foster children. So I worked hard and made something out of myself. It was challenging at first, especially with no one really believing in me. But I made it.</p>

I have to be careful with my decisions, my life is an example for my younger siblings. I must further my education, not only for personal gain, but to also set the stage for my brothers to do what’s right. I am a New Orleans native. I can honestly say that the culture of my city has shaped my life. Having to rebuild my home at age 15 due to Hurricane Katrina, gave me the strength to crash through any barricade, leap over any hurdle. I chose to stay in New Orleans to further my education and have received the privilege to attend Dillard University. I am living my dream thanks to hard work and perseverance.</p>

Living in the rural South was not easy at first, especially since my parents took up the poultry farming profession. Tending to 28,000 demanding chickens is no easy task for a former accountant and his stay-at-home wife. My brother and I had to help out with the farm work whenever we can–it was difficult, but it taught me the value of hard work, and, at the very least, made for some interesting college application essay material. Now I’m at Yale University. Of course, I would not be where I am today without the wonderful “support system” that is my family, friends, teachers, and LEDA (summer program for students of underrepresented backgrounds). They believed in me when I was too chicken (no pun intended) to believe in myself.</p>

However, my junior year at high school, my life took a completely different direction. My parents started having problems and in less than a year, I went through domestic violence, my parents separated, and my siblings and I were left without a home. My last year in high school was very difficult and stressful for me because there were times when I only ate one meal a day , when I had to stay in different shelters and sleep on the floor, when I had to ride the public city bus to school… but I didn’t let this discourage me. On the contrary, it made me strive towards the education I needed in order to be successful in my future. I transformed into a stronger person and I became more responsible and mature. Now I am a student at Texas State University.</p>

At the beginning of high school, some setbacks took place, and I left school for a year. After working in the construction business during that year, I decided to go back to high school, graduate, and go to college. The town in which I attended school was relatively poor, but luckily, it furnished its students with some of the best teachers in the nation. I was encouraged to take challenging courses, made even harder by the fact that I was behind in credit an entire year. With the help of my teachers, though, I made it through those classes. A few anxiety-filled months later, I was accepted to the University of Georgia!</p>

While my mother took refuge in her Christian faith, I took refuge in my education. I eventually made it my goal to be the first in my family to go to college. The University of Rochester put their blind faith on me. They admitted a poor, gay Mexican student; they believed that I could learn and make a difference in the world.</p>
