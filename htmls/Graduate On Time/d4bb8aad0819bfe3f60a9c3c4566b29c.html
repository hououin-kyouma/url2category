          <p>Maybe your dreams aren’t quite as fairytale-esque, but revolve around more realistic things, like getting in the trenches with coworkers and helping them see how a company could be run better. Or recruiting new employees who turn out to be superstar contributors. Or developing strategies that outpace competitors.</p> 
          <p>Whether you’re reaching for success on Wall Street or Main Street, a business degree will help you understand what it takes to get there as well as help build your skills to do it. A business degree is not the only path to business success, but it will prepare you for specific tasks and challenges in a way that other degrees will not.</p>

          <p>And for people looking to save money (good instinct for a future business exec!) or retain their flexibility, going online for your business degree might make a lot of sense. Traditionally, going to college has meant trading in years of work experience and earnings for an education, which is usually worth it.</p> 
          <p>But now, you don’t have to choose between a job and an education—you can do both!</p> 
          <p>You may not know that <a href="https://www.collegechoice.net/rankings/best-online-colleges-and-universities/">online degrees</a> are oftentimes identical to traditional, residential degrees. But it’s true.</p> 
          <p>Most colleges that are serious about their online programs don’t distinguish between them on the diploma, because their rigorous in-person classes are taught by the same professors who teach online courses.</p> 
          <p>“Things have changed,” according to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/articles/2014/02/28/what-employers-really-think-about-your-online-bachelors-degree">a U.S. News &amp; World Report interview with</a> Susan Fontana, a vice president at the global recruiting firm Manpower. Online degrees, she says, are “so much more accepted today.</p>

           <p><strong>Overview</strong></p> 
           <p>The University of Wisconsin—Whitewater: College of Business and Economics is an AACSB accredited business school in Whitewater, WI. Its program offers a 100% online Bachelor of Business Administration Degree with a general business major and marketing minor. On campus, students have a larger array of degree possibilities but both require a hands-on approach to learning by adding an internship or combining real live work experience into the academic classroom.</p> 
           <p><strong>Features</strong></p> 
           <p>All business majors at The University of Wisconsin – Whitewater College of Business and Economics are required to complete at least 20 hours of community service prior to register for Management 489. Students that are allowed to take the required Management 489 course but do not record and document their experience with the Assistant Dean’s office will not receive their diploma. Students can gain this experience by connecting with local student organizations (there are 28 in the College of Business and Economics) or connect with the community to achieve the required hours. Other resources available include:</p> 
           <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Launch Pad:</strong> student start-up accelerator that educates, inspires and accelerates entrepreneurial growth by incorporating training coaching, roundtables and more through the program.</p> 
           <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>VITA </strong>– Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program: students and faculty provide a free service to local community by assisting with taxes at tax time.</p> 
           <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Business Centers:</strong> Employ a student intern to conduct customer research, analyze economic impact and more</p>

           <p>The College of Business and Economics incorporates a strong focus on internships as a hands-on learning experience or lab.

Both can gain marketability for future work, open the doors for new opportunities and develop new skills. These future graduates can gain credit towards graduation and local businesses enjoy bringing people on board that are able to evaluate, respond and create solutions for the organizations’ opportunities and challenges.</p>
