       <h2>From Normal School to University</h2> 
      </div> 
      <div class="medium-6 columns"> 
       <p>The history of The University of Northern Colorado begins in the late 1880s, when citizens of Greeley petitioned the Colorado government to create a school to educate teachers in their community. In April 1889 Governor Cooper signed a bill establishing the Colorado State Normal School. Classes began in October of the next year. </p> 
       <p>The university opened on October 6, 1890, as the Colorado State Normal School to train qualified teachers for the state's public schools, with a staff of four instructors and 96 students. Greeley's citizens raised the money for the first building. </p> 
      </div> 
      <div class="medium-6 columns"> 
       <p>In 1911 the school's name was changed to Colorado State Teachers College and two years later, in 1913, graduate courses were added to the school’s curriculum, leading to a name change in 1935, when the school became the Colorado State College of Education. </p> 
       <p>The school continues to grow, and in 1957 the name was shortened to Colorado State College to reflect the wider range of programs and degrees. Finally, in 1970 the name was changed to the current University of Northern Colorado. </p>

         <div class="medium-5 medium-offset-1 columns"> 
          <p>Dr. Zachariah Xenophon Snyder arrived at the fledgling university in 1891. He studied and implemented the principles of American philosopher and psychologist John Dewey by advancing the ideals of a “child-centered education. </p> 
          <p>He established Colorado’s first kindergarten, and Laura Tefft, from the famous Foebel-Pestalozzo Kindergarten School in Berlin, organized the innovative school. An early photograph shows young children playing on a playground located on campus. </p> 
          <p>While playgrounds are now an everyday sight at primary schools, they were considered an innovation at the time. One of the Normal School’s first master’s theses explored the national playground movement. </p>

          <p>In 1913, President Snyder established a graduate school at CSCE. After his death in 1915, President John Grant Crabbe saw the university through World War I and the Spanish influenza epidemic. </p> 
          <p>He met financial challenges by contracting with the War Department to initiate the Student Army Training Corps (SATC), housing and educating active service men. Influenza fears fueled a call for closures of universities, but Crabbe kept classes in session while the school was quarantined, keeping student from traveling home and almost certain risk of exposure. </p> 
          <p>No lives were lost on campus. He remained at the university until his death in 1924 at the age of 58. </p>

         </div> 
         <div class="medium-5 medium-offset-1 columns"> 
          <p>George W. Frasier was the university’s president from 1924 to 1948. The Graduate School was created in 1930. </p> 
          <p>Frasier emphasized teachers who are also scholars, which is still a hallmark of the university. “…faculty members were not only expected to make professional contributions but were to concentrate on their teaching responsibilities as well; everyone taught classes, including Frasier, his administrative staff, and the chairs of the departments.” </p> 
          <p>During World War II, the university operated an army air force clerical training school for more than 4,000 men. Frasier consulted for the Civil Aeronautics Administration and the college conducted a cattle-feeding operation to provide meat for students and Air Force trainees. </p> 
          <p>In 1942, as Japanese Americans were imprisoned at the Granada Relocation Center in Lamar, Colorado (part of the US’s controversial policy of relocating some 110,000 Japanese Americans) the university offered interns the opportunity to earn student teaching credit. </p>
