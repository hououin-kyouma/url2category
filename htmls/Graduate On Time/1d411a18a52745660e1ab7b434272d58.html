        <p>Paying for college is a bit of a puzzle. You have to know what to expect before you dive into this process. Scholarships are great sources to use because they offer merit-based funding to students. </p> 
        <p>Loans have to be paid back but they can also be helpful. However, what you may not know is that one of the best forms of funding for college are grants. These funds are generally need-based and do not have to be paid back. Thus, if you are looking for a way to make your dreams come true, you need to search for grants.</p> 
        <p>There are many types of grants available today. There are those that are offered by non-profits around the world and those that are given out by famous companies and organizations. </p> 
        <p>One of the best and most reliable grants to invest in is government sources. These grants are reliable ways to fund college. After all, the government wants its citizens to succeed. If you succeed, then you will be that much more likely to give back to the country and will stimulate the economy and give back in other ways. </p> 
        <p>The following are just some of the many things to know when it comes to finding, qualifying for, and applying for government grants for college.</p> 
        <h2>Federal and State</h2> 
        <p>You can find two main types of government grants: federal and state options. The federal grants offerings are fairly straightforward since theyâve been around for quite some time. The federal government puts aside a certain amount of money each year for specific programs to help them succeed. </p> 
        <p>More and more children are earning high school diplomas and are looking to attend college. The government knows this and has funds to help make this a reality.</p> 
        <p>Since 1972, the federal Pell Grant has helped low-income students attend school. This program is based on the premise that low-income families may not be able to save for their children to attend school. Thus, the grant is supposed to fill this gap in. The amount of the Pell Grant changes depending on the available funds and budget of the federal government.<img src="http://www.collegegrant.net/wp-content/uploads/govgrants-300x198.jpg" align="right" alt="" title="govgrants" width="300" height="198" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-589" srcset="http://www.collegegrant.net/wp-content/uploads/govgrants-300x198.jpg 300w, http://www.collegegrant.net/wp-content/uploads/govgrants.jpg 426w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p> 
        <p>Another great federal grant to consider is the Academic Competitiveness (AC) Grant. This funding is available to freshman and sophomores who have stellar academic track records and have shown talent and commitment to leadership and community service endeavors. To qualify for the AC Grant, students must also meet the income requirements of the Pell Grant.</p> 
        <p>Another great federal grant is the National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grant (SMART Grant). This grant is awarded to college juniors and seniors who plan to study computer science, engineering, math, or the sciences. Interested parties must also qualify for the income requirements of the Pell Grant.</p> 
        <p>Different states will offer different types of grants. Thus, you need to be sure to read up on what your state has to offer you. For example, Michigan has grants in place to help non-traditional adult students as well as the academically gifted and low-income students. To qualify for such funds, you will need to be a legal resident of the state and be able to provide proof of this.</p> 
        <h2>Ethnicity and Race Matter</h2> 
        <p>When looking for state funds, know that your ethnicity and race do in fact matter. Many groups have been discriminated against in the past and have not had the same advantages of other groups. Thus, there may be state programs directed towards helping such groups as African Americans and Native Americans receive the funding they need to attend college.</p> 
        <h2>Service in Exchange for Funds</h2> 
        <p>There are a number of states that are trying to recruit certain types of professionals. Thus, you may be able to secure government grants for college if you are willing to exchange service for funding. For example, there are states that are trying to recruit the best and brightest teachers. Thus, they may be more willing to pay for students to attend college if they are willing to then commit a certain amount of time teaching in the state. This is a way to improve the stateâs education system while also providing government grants for college to in-need students. If you want such funding, take the time to consider whether or not you are willing to make this sort of commitment.</p> 
        <h2>Get Your Financial Documents in Order</h2> 
        <p>Once you having found some government grants for college that you want to apply for, it is time to dig in and really gather together all of your financial documents. You will need to prove that you are in fact in need of assistance. This may mean that you also need to gather your parentsâ or legal guardianâs tax returns and financial documents. Having this information on hand will ensure that your application is complete.</p> 
        <h2>Be Aware of Deadlines</h2> 
        <p>Federal and state governments do not care if your car breaks down or if there is an illness in the family. Thus, if you want to secure government grants for college, you need to plan ahead and start working on the applications as early as possible. Try to submit your work well before the deadlines so that emergencies and accidents do not derail you. The governments receive thousands of applications: They will not be able to grant exceptions for you if something goes wrong. Really, working ahead of time and staying on top of deadlines will allow you to secure your chances.</p> 
        <h2>Do Your Research</h2> 
        <p>The best way to secure solid government grants for college is to know what it is required or needed for all of the applications. This means that you need to read up on the requirements and on the necessary documents that need to be included. If you have questions about what the requirements mean, talk to your schoolâs counselor to see if they can help guide you through this process. Donât think that you can send in an essay and a transcript and call it a day. Extensive documentation is a major piece of government grants. Thus, you want to be sure to completely understand the applications before you dive in and send them in.</p> 
        <h2>Explain Yourself</h2> 
        <p>When you fill out grant applications, you need to really think about why you want to attend college. Take the time to make yourself memorable. This means being clear in any and all documents sent to colleges and organizations. Have a love done look over any and all application materials you may send out. You want to ensure it is error free so that you present the best possible image of yourself.</p> 
        <h2>The Colleges Will Do a Lot of the Work</h2> 
        <p>Often, you will not have to directly apply to government grants for college, especially in regards to the federal government. When you get your potential financial aid packages from colleges, you may find that the Pell Grant is already listed. However, if it is not, be sure to call up the college and see if you can work something out. State grants may require that you send in applications. It all depends on how the governments are running their grant programs and how much work the college admissions and financial aid office is willing to do. Thus, be sure to go through your financial aid package with a fine tooth comb to ensure you know whether you have been approved for such funding opportunities.</p> 
        <p>There are government grants for college if you take the time to look for them. You may not qualify for all of the programs but every bit does count. Do your research and mark your calendar so that you can hunt down funding for school.</p>

I am in desperate need for money for college. UNH has one of the best criminal justice programs in the country, and is only one of three schools that offer forensic psychology as a major. I want to get my bachelorâs degree in criminal justice so that I can go to graduate law school to become a judge. My family and I do not have the money for me to pursue my dream. Both my parents work overtime as much as they can, I worked three jobs my senior year of high school but there is still not enough with having to fund both my and my brother through college. I need help just for this one year. I plan on applying for an RA or room advisor at my school next year which will take a great deal of the burden off, but with the way things are going I may not be back for second semester.

I have a passion for helping people so therefore Iâm looking into majoring for Nursing. My family finical income is not so good, so I am trying my hardest to sign up for scholars ships and looking for Grants. A grant about 7,000$ would be great and would help me a lot, because Iâm going to be living in an apartment with a roommate so I can attend the college with the best nursing school. I have just finish the CNA training program and will be looking for a job while attending college as a full time student, just so I can make some more money, pay for college, and help my parents out as well.

I grew up in poverty and canât really afford college. I want to go to college and become an Ob nurse. With the help of grants I can pursue my life long dream of being the first in my family to granduate high school and college. In high school I did receive my C.N.A license so I do have some experience in nursing. I love being around people and helping others and I want to continue my education but the only way I can do so is through grants. Iâve been searching for months with no luck. I live on my own and work fulltime and have also been a care giver to my two younger brothers so money is tight. My parents donât help out and Iâm struggling. I want to show my brothers that college is the way to go and keep them on the right track. I want to be able to provide for my future family and myself. I love helping others and with grants I can further pursue my education and become what I want to be. Please help me help myself and my future. Thank you very much for your time and I hope and pray for the help. Forever and always, Tamarae Fell. (A very committed student)</p> </li>

My name is Chelsea Qualls, and I graduated from Cabot High School in May of 2011. Cabot is a small town located in Arkansas; however, I moved on to a little bit of a better town called Sherwood. I had a goal for the four years I was in High School to attend a College that I knew would further my education. University of Phoenix found me. I am getting my Bachelorâs Degree in Information Technology and Web Design. I could not be happier than my choice in this institution. There is a slight backslide though, which happens to be the money. There are several thousands of students that struggle with money to go to College, and I am one of them. The financial aid through the institution helped me out a lot, but I am having to take out $4,000 some odd dollars a year for three to four years for furthering my education. I find this difficult for myself because I already had a hard time making myself finish High School due to lots of financial situations, and I am just hoping that I stick through this. I have a 4.0 grade point average, and I attend school regularly. I have not missed a class, I keep up with all my work, and participate in discussions. My first class, I passed with a 96.4%, and I am currently in my second class. I hope that some where out there, I can just find a little extra money to help go towards school so I can stop stressing out and make my dreams go the extra mile that I have always wanted to make them go. Thank you for your time.</p> </li>

RIT is a great school and I love it so much. I also love my major and there are few schools that offer such a quality education for Industrial design. I switched into the major this year from graphic design, also at RIT. Due to this decision, I have added an extra year onto my college education.I feel strongly that it was worth it to peruse my passion and hopefully have a bright and happy future. Right now paying for that dream is becoming increasingly difficult .Although RIT is amazing , it is also an extremely expensive school. I get a miniscule amount of federal and school aid each year, however my parents do not help me pay for college. I am on my own and I do not qualify for any additional loans myself. The most important thing to me is to graduate college to be successful. My dream is to graduate and use my degree as an industrial designer to aid the daily lives of developing nations through sanitation design as well as incorporate sustainable design principles in my work. I am so passionate about my work and it is unbearable to think what would happen if I could not further my education because of inability to pay. I do not want anything else but to be able to pay for school and anything would help. Thank you so much for reading this.</p> </li>

I am currently paying back the University, because I did not know starting the semester that I had lost the scholarship. It started at 15,000+, and is not ~11,000. I have been placed on a payment plan and have been paying it faithfully for a year and a half. I am eager to get back into school and finish my education closer to home, but GW will not release my transcript until I finish paying them. I am just wondering if it is possible to recieve a grant to pay the school off without being enrolled in an institution at the time.</p> </li>

        <!--			<small class="commentmetadata"><a href="#comment-264508" title="">October 23rd, 2012 at 4:36 pm</a> </small> --> <p>My name is Kayla Keemer. I am coming to you today in regards to asking for help. I have spent my whole life dedicated to studies and maintaining good grades in hopes that I would get into a good college and let my dreams become my reality. Last year, I spent my first year away at school. I was lucky enough to be enrolled in the college of my dreams, The Pennsylvania State University, and I loved every minute of being up there. I was in love with the atmosphere and the prestige of the school. Like many others, Iâm sure you have heard of the recent announcement of the scandal between Jerry Sandusky and the university. Unfortunately with that scandal there was a reduction in funds across the board. With this reduction in funds, I was not able to get help from the university or from banks. I had tried to take out loan after loan from every bank imaginable. I hate to see that everything I have worked for has been put to an end. We live in a country that others look to for the fulfillment of their dreams and yet so many of the people that live here already canât even accomplish theirs. My main goal is to become a teacher, which has been my goal since childhood. In preparation for what I thought would be my fall semester I went back to my high school, where I observed teachers from behind the scenes, for over 80 hours. I had a chance to work with some of these students. It saddened me to see that so many teachers didnât care that more than half of their students were failing; they were just simply looking for that next pay check to come in. Part of my goal as an aspiring teacher is to teach others beyond a textbook and show them their true potential, making the statement âthe word is yoursâ true. How can I do that when my dreams are struggling to happen? I have filled out scholarship application after scholarship application with the same unfortunate answer of, âthank you for your interest in, whatever the organization was, but you are not a winner this time. Please apply back for another chance.â Our president has said that he has given over 3 trillion dollars back to the education system, yet it is still so difficult for a twenty year old to get the funds needed to continue her education. I ask for your help in making my goals attainable, in any way, shape, or form. Help me to become something more so that I can help others do the same.</p> </li>

        <!--			<small class="commentmetadata"><a href="#comment-1067211" title="">December 26th, 2014 at 11:37 pm</a> </small> --> <p>Hi, my name is Daniel Olvera,and I donât know what else to do, so I thought maybe you could work something out to help me. I have found myself pretty much at the end of the road, and everywhere Iâve looked to seek help, I have received absolutely nothing. I donât understand why my life has to seem so complicated and difficult, that I canât even get my FAFSA right. I have ended my first semester with a dept of 15,000$. Why? well, because of one, my FAFSA had been chosen for further paperwork. My parents didnât want to provide that information. So I started out with absolutely no help from FAFSA. My plan was to have FAFSA lower my tuition cost, use the grant money I could receive, then use federal work study to help pay it off even more. Whatever was left I would pay off with a loan. I had it all planned out, but seeing how my FAFSA hadnât gone through, I got absolutely nothing. So I just pushed through the year, already being a struggle pulling 17 credits, and being an architecture undergraduate. I felt like there was no way for me to get anything right. I contacted LARES, and they didnât seem to know anything. I even sought out help from a public relations officer, who pretty much told me that there was nothing left I could do to save myself from having to leave school with this dept. I didnât want to leave school. I absolutely love school, and I know some people find that hard to understand, but I really do. I contacted the UIC office many times to see if I could get it fixed, or have my status changed. And yet, for some reason, I canât get anything done. I found out that the office actually had an âAcceptance of Deptâ form I could fill out, and have my fee waived just long enough to register for classes, then have it added on to next years charges. However, I was going to have to put down 8,000 in order to have it done. Little luck with that. I canât even get out loans. Being in the household I was, I pretty much was useless in the big world. Being adopted into a family, and then pushed to succeed was my first struggle. My parents donât believe in âkidsâ having phones, or credit cards. So I apply to jobs, and donât get accepted because of my limitations or âun-experienceâ Iâve had enough. I had set down a plan of action for school, and it all went to waste. Iâve contacted so many people, and Iâve come down to absolutely nothing. I praying for a miracle, and hoping you could find something to help me. If that is waiving my tuition, great. But even if itâs just temporarily waiving it so I can apply to next semester, Iâd be happy with that too. I donât want to come out as a failure. My parents have worked hard enough just to get to where they are, and seeing how I seem not to even try to get my school stuff figured out angers them. They see me as useless, and thatâs the worst feeling. I just donât have any more options left. please contact me with any type of positive reinforcement.</p> </li>
