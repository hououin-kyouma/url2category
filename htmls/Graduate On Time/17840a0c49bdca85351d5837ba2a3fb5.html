          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re thinking about going back to school or enrolling for the first time, but wondering whether or not to get an online degree, take heart that determining what’s right for you is actually quite simple! </span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We at College Choice know the ins and outs of online education, and we are eager to point you toward the best possible academic fit. </span></p> 
          <h3><b>Are online degrees respected? </b></h3> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short answer is, yes and no. </span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some degree programs—namely those that are regionally accredited and allow credits to be easily transferred in (and out!)—are highly reputable. Likewise, <strong>some online degrees have been in place for over a decade and have gone to great lengths to earn their renowned reputation. </strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a list of such schools, see below. Then there are those offered through for-profit schools, are nationally accredited, and have not been in place for very long. <strong>Keep your eyes out for those shaky programs. </strong></span></p> 
          <h3><b>Should I get an online degree? </b></h3> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Online degrees are an affordable, <strong><em>flexible</em></strong> option for some people, especially working adults who juggle many responsibilities.</strong> There are dozens, if not hundreds, of fantastic online degree programs that are, at once, highly regarded and affordable. </span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you can earn a degree from renowned Penn State while living and working from anywhere in the country. However, this means Penn State football games, student social opportunities, campus lectures, etc., will not be part of your college experience. </span></p> 
          <h3><b>Are online degrees easier? More affordable? Faster? </b></h3> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because schools must offer the same curriculum to their online students, <strong>it’s not easier to get an online degree.</strong> Added challenges include a difference of technical and academic support as an online student. </span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, many programs offer deep cuts on tuition rates for their online students (these vary by school), as well as the option to expedite your degree, earning it a full year (or more!) before “traditional” students. Again, this varies by school.</span></p> 
          <h3><b>What do employers really think about online degrees? Can I get a job with an online degree? </b></h3> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the truth. <strong>Employers care </strong></span><strong><i>much </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>more about advanced education than whether you took classes online</strong>, and most won’t even know because your diploma lists only the school name and degree granted. </span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job placement is never a guarantee after graduation, but online education is definitely not a hindrance. And advanced education is a guaranteed strength on your resume!</span></p> 
          <h3><b>How are online degrees different than “traditional” degrees? </b></h3> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, the differences are minimal, and that which is different points to the strengths of online education. That is, <strong>online learning lends itself toward flexibility, affordability, and adaptability. </strong></span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between the two kinds of learning is mostly in “the college experience.” That is, you won’t have access to the kind of social life you would if you took classes on campus. </span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, “traditional” degrees don’t emphasize the self-driven nature of online degrees, a huge asset in all industries.</span></p> 
          <h3><b>How do online colleges work? </b></h3> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This really depends on the school itself, whether students are required to login for lectures, to test at exam centers, to supplement their online education with practicums in their local community, etc. </span></p> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, <strong>most schools subscribe to a student-centered approach to education, stressing flexibility and independence.</strong> Online students complete coursework at their own pace, logging into the school’s online infrastructure to access services, lectures, assignments, virtual discussion, and much more. </span></p> 
          <h3><b>How do I spot a good online college or university? </b></h3> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is super important. Here’s what to look for in online education, regardless of what degree you are pursuing:</span></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A highly reputable, regional accreditation. Though some national accredited schools still provide great programs, regional accreditation points to high academic standards.</span></li> 
           <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A school that accepts prior educational credits and, perhaps even more importantly, allows students to transfer credits if they choose to switch programs later. </span></li> 
           <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solid stats when it comes to graduation, retention, and student loan default rates. You can find all over at </span><a href="http://www.usnews.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. News &amp; World Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li> 
           <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can boast a breadth of services to their online students, from academic advising to technical help, financial guidance, and faculty accessibility. </span></li> 
          </ul>

           <p>Washington State University’s online portal, known as Global Campus, has sparked a reputation for being one of the best online universities in the country. The school is regionally accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities and currently serves over 2,000 students across 20 online degree programs. It is known for having one of the first online education programs and was founded in 1993 to serve working professionals.</p> 
           <p>WSU Global Campus is bolstered by the fact that it is one of the few accredited online colleges that offers each student personal academic assistance and access to a global alumni network. This access starts from the moment a student is accepted into the program and lasts throughout that student’s education and career. This is further reinforced by a student’s ability to partake in the Global Connections program, an on-campus experience that creates relationships between online students and industry professionals and alumni.</p> 
           <p>WSU Global Campus is much more than an online school—it’s a community of students and teachers who come together to learn about online teaching and what can improve the experience. This is a growing trend for many online colleges and universities. Many WSU faculty are even trained to not only teach online courses; they are trained to teach you how to create your own courses and teach them as well. This is why WSU is known as a destination for online learning.</p>
