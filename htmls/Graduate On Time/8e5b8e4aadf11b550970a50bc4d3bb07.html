                               <p>Each case is different. Some students distinguish themselves for admission with their unusual academic promise through experience or achievements in study or research. Other students present compelling cases because they are more “well-rounded,” having contributed in many different ways to their schools or communities. Still other successful applicants are “well-lopsided” with demonstrated excellence in one particular endeavor. Some students bring perspectives formed by unusual personal circumstances or experiences. Like many colleges, we seek to admit dynamic, talented, and diverse students who will contribute significantly to the education of their&nbsp;classmates.</p>

We want to do everything possible to help the students we enroll make the most of their opportunities, avoiding the much reported “burnout” phenomenon that can keep them from reaching their full potential. Our overall graduation rate of 98%, among the highest in the nation, is perhaps due in part to the fact that so many students take time off, before or during college. The Admissions Committee encourages admitted students to defer enrollment for one year to travel, pursue a special project or activity, work, or spend time in another meaningful way—provided they do not enroll in a degree-granting program at another college. Deferrals for two-year military service are also granted. Each year, between 80 and 110 students defer their matriculation to the College, and they report their experiences to be uniformly positive. After graduation, large numbers of Harvard students take time off before beginning work or graduate school. See more about taking time&nbsp;off.</p>

You will not be at a disadvantage if an interview cannot be arranged. In the U.S., Canada and the U.K., an alumnus/a will contact an applicant directly by phone, e-mail, or letter if such an interview is possible. If you live outside these areas, we aim to hold an admission interview when and where possible. Our interviewers abroad are graduates of Harvard who offer their assistance on a volunteer basis. While we try to make interviewers as widely available as possible, it will not always be possible for a student to have an interview. The absence of an interview will not adversely affect your candidacy. <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/application-process/what-we-look/interviews">See more about international interviews</a>.</p>

                               <p>Science and engineering have long been priorities at Harvard. There are more than two dozen state-of-the-art facilities for science research at Harvard, and new computer science and chemistry laboratories opened in 2008. Moreover, forty-one of our former and current science faculty members have won Nobel Prizes. About half of recent entering students intend to major in the natural sciences, engineering, computer science or mathematics.

                               <p>In our liberal arts program, students are broadly educated in the social sciences, the natural sciences and the humanities, as well as trained in a particular academic field of specialization called a concentration. Students take one course in each of the eight areas of the General Education Program, which is designed to broaden each student’s intellectual perspective, while selecting a field of concentration from more than forty academic departments. Students will usually take about half of their courses in their concentration, one-quarter in the General Education Program, and one-quarter student-chosen electives. The only specific course that is required for all students is a one-semester writing course, although each department has certain courses that a student must take to earn a degree in that field. Programs are, therefore, quite individualized for each student. Whatever a student’s curricular choices, every undergraduate learns to read, write, and think critically — skills important to any endeavor.

We feel strongly that both parents have an obligation to support you, and a divorce or separation does not change that obligation. We look at each case individually, and we make every effort to be sensitive to particular family circumstances when deciding how much to ask from each parent. If either parent is remarried, financial information about their new spouse and dependents, if any, should be provided. In this way we obtain the fullest possible picture of your financial background and can make the fairest judgment about your need for assistance. If we have received financial information from both your parents, the figure listed as “parent contribution” on your award letter will be the combined figure for your parent 1 and parent 2, determined by doing a separate need analysis for each. It is up to you and your parents to decide how to divide the responsibility for paying the&nbsp;termbills.</p>

This means that you are encouraged to find a job to help cover your costs although you are not eligible to work in <span class="caps">FWSP</span>-only jobs. There are many non-<span class="caps">FWSP</span> jobs available on campus as well, and last year close to 65% of all Harvard students chose to work during the year. <span class="caps">FWSP</span> is a wage subsidy program designed to expand your range of employment opportunities both on and off campus. <span class="caps">FWSP</span> is a federal financial aid program and thus it is not an option for international students or students who are not receiving federal aid. The <span class="caps">FWSP</span> wage-subsidy allows employers to hire students at wages they might not otherwise be able to afford because the federal government will pay roughly 70% of student earnings.

                               <p>A large percentage of each entering freshman class receives one or more outside awards from national or local organizations. When adjusting the Harvard financial aid package, 100% of the total outside award amount is first deducted from your job expectation, and then from your summer earnings expectation, up to the total amount of those expectations. If the total of outside awards exceeds the combined amount of your job and summer earnings expectations, that excess amount is deducted from the Harvard Scholarship. Since outside awards are additional resources that help to meet need, they may not be used to replace your parents’ contribution or other expected family&nbsp;resource.</p> 
                               <p>For example, if you were originally offered a financial aid package with a $3,000 job, a summer earnings expectation of $1,600, and a $15,000 Harvard Scholarship and subsequently receive a $2,000 National Merit award and $2,000 from the Elks Club, then we will reduce your term-time job expectation to $0 and your summer expectation to $600.

                               <p>Travel: An allowance toward the cost of traveling to and from Harvard has been included in your budget on your award letter and used in calculating your eligibility for financial aid. You are responsible for booking and paying for your own travel. Many students will use the money they earn over the summer to meet the costs of travel to and from Harvard.<br> Personal Expenses: The estimated cost for books, supplies, clothing, laundry, telephone, entertainment, local transportation, and other incidentals has been included in the personal expenses portion of your budget. Students generally spend between $800-$1200 on books over the course of both semesters. You are responsible for paying your own personal expenses. Many of the students will use money earned at their term-time jobs to cover personal&nbsp;expenses.</p>

As expenses can vary greatly based on each student’s discretion, we are not able to meet every student’s individual expenses. Rather, we build an allowance toward them in your budget, but leave the daily choices to you. For instance, in regard to local travel expenses, we might be able to offer you financial aid toward commuting from your apartment to your school campus, but we wouldn’t be able to offer you scholarship toward a traveling tour that is separate from your program. However, we recognize that you may want to take advantage of your time away from Cambridge, and we encourage you to make your time abroad enriching and educational in the broadest sense. We may be able to offer you subsidized loan to help you expand the scope of your experience abroad, and allow you a wider range of&nbsp;choices.</p>

This is a subsidized loan that you can take out for your time abroad. If you don’t end up using the loan funds while abroad, you can simply return them when you return. Interest on these funds does not begin to accrue until 6 months after graduation/withdrawal, so they may be a much better option than credit cards to help you manage&nbsp;expenses.</p>
