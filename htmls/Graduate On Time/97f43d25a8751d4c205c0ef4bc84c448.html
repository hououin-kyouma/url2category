      <p class="faqquestion">Can I schedule an appointment with an admissions counselor? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>Unfortunately, we do not have admissions counselors or advisors. All the information you need to know about applying to Emory School of Medicine is included on this website.&nbsp; If, after reviewing the information on this website, you still have questions, you may call the Office of Admissions at 404-727-5660. Here are some of the basics: &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>In order to meet Emory course requirements, you will need to complete at least four full years, with labs, in the basic sciences (one year in each of the following areas: biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, and physics). We expect medical school students to have a sound knowledge in these areas, <strong>prior to attending medical school</strong>. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>For the class admitted in 2016, the average old MCAT score was 34 and the average new MCAT score was 514.&nbsp; The average GPA was 3.7. Emory receives over 8000 applications each year for its incoming class of 138 students, so you’ll need to be competitive in order to be invited for an interview. &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>Another important thing to keep in mind is that the application “season” begins 14 months prior to each year’s fall semester, so be sure to plan ahead. Applications are submitted online via the American Medical College Application System (AMCAS) at <a class="link_external" href="http://www.amcas.org/">www.amcas.org</a>, beginning in May (for application to the fall of the following year).</p> 
       <p>You may also find it helpful to meet with your pre-medical advisor at your college or university for assistance applying to medical school.</p>

      <a id="General_Questions2"></a>
      <p class="faqquestion">What courses should I be taking to prepare for medical school? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>In order to meet Emory course requirements, you will need to complete at least four full years, with labs, in the basic sciences (one year in each of the following areas: biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, and physics). We expect medical school students to have a sound knowledge in these areas, <strong>prior to attending medical school</strong>. &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>You will also need to complete six semester hours of English (a full year of college-level grammar and composition). If you feel that your coursework in other areas would fulfill this requirement, you will be given an opportunity in the Emory Supplemental Application to explain. This does not guarantee that an exception will granted. The final decision rests with the Admissions Committee. Exceptions are made for individuals with very high grades or for those who demonstrate grammar and composition aptitude in other areas (MCAT scores, thesis work, publication of research/articles, etc.). &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>Lastly, you will need to complete at least 18 hours of coursework in the Humanities and Social Sciences. Examples of courses that meet this requirement include:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Anthropology</li> 
        <li>Art/Art Appreciation/Art History</li> 
        <li>Black Studies/African American Studies</li>

      <p class="faqquestion">Do I have to be a pre-med major to apply to Emory? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>You do not have to be a pre-med or biology major to apply to Emory. Every year, we admit students with non-science majors. The most important consideration is that you meet the course requirements, including four full years in the sciences (see question above for complete list of course requirements).</p>

      <p class="faqquestion">Does it matter where I go to college? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>Emory accepts students from state schools, as well as private schools. We do not consider students from any particular college or university to be more prepared for medical school than others, although we do recognize that some schools are more academically rigorous than others. What you do and accomplish during your undergraduate career speaks more highly of your preparation for medical school, than does a degree from a particular institution. &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>If your undergraduate degree is from a college or university in the United States or Canada, the college or university <strong>must</strong> be regionally accredited in order for you to qualify for admission to Emory. For a list of accredited schools, please visit the website for the Council for Higher Education Accreditation at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.chea.org"></a><a class="link_external" href="http://www.chea.org/directories/">http://www.chea.org/directories/</a> .

      <p class="faqquestion">What if I've been out of college for a while? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>Over 60% of last year’s class had taken a year or more “off” after college. Some took full-time jobs, some did overseas volunteer work, others pursued their interests outside of medicine. We do not consider this a disadvantage. &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>Some applicants feel that they need to take a few post-graduate science courses to strengthen/refresh their knowledge in the sciences. This is not required, but consider that you will need to be able to submit strong, recent MCAT scores (taken within four years of matriculation) in order to be competitive. &nbsp;</p>

      <p class="faqquestion">How do I apply to Emory School of Medicine? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>The application process begins about 14 months prior to each year’s fall semester.</p> 
       <p>Applications to most medical schools, including Emory, are submitted online with the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). The application season begins in early May of each year (for admission to the fall semester of the <em>following</em> year). The deadline to apply through AMCAS is October 15. You may learn more about AMCAS on the Association of American Medical Colleges website: <a class="link_external" href="https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/amcas/">www.aamc.org/students/amcas/start.htm</a> &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>Part of your AMCAS application will include the selection of all the medical schools to which you wish to apply. If you select Emory as one of your choices, AMCAS will send your verified information to us.&nbsp;</p> 
       <p><span>For the 2017-18 Application Cycle, Emory<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><strong>will</strong><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><strong>prescreen for minimum MCAT scores</strong><span>. For applicants submitting an MCAT taken prior to January 2015, Emory will prescreen for a minimum MCAT score of 27 with at least a 7 in each of the three subtests. Applicants&nbsp;with an MCAT total score of less than 27, or a subtest score of less than 7 on any of the three MCAT subtests will not receive an invitation to complete an Emory Supplemental Application. For applicants submitting an MCAT taken January 2015 or later, Emory will prescreen for a minimum MCAT score of 500 with at least a 123 in each of the four subtests. Applicants&nbsp;with an MCAT total score of less than 500, or a subtest score of less than 123 on any of the four MCAT subtests will not receive an invitation to complete an Emory Supplemental Application.&nbsp; If an applicant has more than one MCAT score, the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><strong><em>latest score</em></strong><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>will be used to determine eligibility.</span> In order to receive the Emory Supplemental Application, an applicant must have taken the MCAT no more than 3 times.&nbsp; An applicant who has taken the MCAT 4 or more times, will not receive an Emory Supplemental Application</p> 
       <p>Once your verified application is received at Emory (and your application meets our prescreening criteria), you will receive an email from the Office of Admissions providing access to Emory’s online Supplemental Application.</p> 
       <p>Applicants will be required to submit a headshot photo and application fee with their online Emory Supplemental Application. The deadline to submit the Supplemental Application is December 1. &nbsp;</p>

       <p>We strongly suggest you submit two letters from professors who taught you in the hard sciences (Biology, Chemistry and Physics) in your undergraduate or post-baccalaureate education or from someone familiar with your research and knowledge in the sciences.</p> 
       <p>If you are unable to submit letters from two science professors, you may substitute letters from other educators, advisors, or employers, but keep in mind that Emory is an extremely competitive school.

      <p class="faqquestion">What if my early college grades are significantly lower than my most recent grades, including post-baccalaureate courses taken? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>The Admissions Committee will look at the improvement a student makes over the course of his or her college career. An ascending GPA will look better than a descending GPA. However, the strength of all courses taken, both in the early and later years will be considered.</p>

      <p class="faqquestion">Do you accept AP credit? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>We will accept some Advancement Placement (AP) credit, as long as it appears on your undergraduate transcript. However, a solid background in the sciences is essential to do well on the MCAT science subtests and to be accepted to a rigorous medical school program, such as Emory. &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>It is highly recommended that you complete at least four full years, with labs, in the basic sciences (one year in each of the following areas: biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, and physics). We expect medical school students to have a sound knowledge in these areas, <strong>prior to attending medical school</strong><strong>.</strong> If you have AP credit in any of these general science areas, you may find it helpful to take additional science courses to keep your knowledge in the sciences strong, but it is not required.</p>

      <p class="faqquestion">What if I don't meet all the course requirements? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>If you do not meet the minimum course requirements, you will be given an opportunity in the Emory Supplemental Application to explain why. Exceptions are made. They are rare, but they are made for individuals with very high grades or for those who demonstrate an exceptional aptitude in the sciences and in other areas (strong MCAT scores, published research, etc.). &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>Another important factor to consider is scoring well on the MCAT science subtests. Our admitted students score an average of 34 on the "old" version of the MCAT, and 515 on the "new" version. If you are able to score well in the MCAT science subtests, this will certainly be a significant indicator of your knowledge in the sciences.</p>

      <p class="faqquestion">Do I have to complete all the course requirements before I submit my application to Emory? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>It is highly recommended that you complete most, if not all, of your science requirements prior to applying. Some required labs and humanities coursework may be completed after applying. All required courses must be completed before matriculating at Emory.</p>

      <p class="faqquestion">Do I need to send my transcripts to Emory? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>No. All of your coursework will be verified by AMCAS, so you do not need to send transcripts as part of your application. &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>If you are offered admission, you must submit official, final transcripts from all schools attended to the Office of Admissions prior to matriculation.</p>

      <p class="faqquestion">What does "accredited" mean? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>“Accredited” means a regionally accredited institution in the United States or Canada. If your undergraduate degree is from a college or university in the United States or Canada, the college or university <strong>must</strong> be regionally accredited in order for you to qualify for admission to Emory. For a list of accredited schools, please visit the web site for the Council for Higher Education Accreditation at <a class="link_external" href="http://www.chea.org/directories/">http://www.chea.org/directories/</a> . Look for their “Regional Accrediting Organizations.” &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>If your degree is from a college in the U.S. or Canada that is not accredited, you are not eligible to apply to Emory School of Medicine until you complete at least 90 semester hours of coursework, including all the course requirements, at a regionally accredited institution.</p> 
       <p>If your degree is from an institution outside the United States or Canada, you will need to complete one full year of coursework, including 2 semesters of biology (with lab), two semesters of General or Inorganic Chemistry (with lab), two semesters of Organic Chemistry (with lab) and two semesters of Physical Science (with lab) at a regionally accredited college or university in the U.S. or Canada <strong>before</strong> applying to Emory.</p>

      <p class="faqquestion">Do you accept applications from international students? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>Yes. International students are welcome to apply. &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>The admissions process is the same for domestic and international students. All applicants will receive a full review of their file, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>All applicants must plan to complete a four-year undergraduate college degree program. If your undergraduate degree is from a college or university in the United States or Canada, the college or university <strong>must</strong> be regionally accredited in order for you to qualify for admission to Emory. If your undergraduate degree is from a college outside the United States, you must complete all science course requirements, including 2 semesters of biology with lab, 2 semesters of chemistry with lab, 2 semesters of organic chemistry with lab and 2 semesters of physical science with lab (and English, if English language skills are not strong) at an accredited U.S. or Canadian college<strong>.</strong></p> 
       <p><strong><em>What financial aid is available to international students?</em></strong> <em><br> </em> Please note that citizens of foreign countries are ineligible to receive U.S. federal financial aid, but may be eligible to receive merit-based scholarships. &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>Permanent residents with I-151, I-551, or I-551C VISAS are eligible for federal financial aid, as well as merit-based scholarships. &nbsp;</p> 
       <p>All international students are required by Emory University to show proof of ability to pay all four years of tuition <strong>prior to becoming admitted</strong>—eligibility for scholarship cannot be determined until the student is admitted.</p>

      <a id="After_Applying_to_Emory1"></a>
      <p class="faqquestion">After my application is complete, what happens next? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>All completed applications will be screened for an interview. If you are invited for an interview, you will be notified by email or telephone, so please be sure to keep AMCAS and the Office of Admissions informed of any changes in your contact information.</p> 
       <p>Approximately 750 applicants will be invited for an interview between September and February.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>We expect to receive over 8000 applications this year, so less than 10% of all applicants will be interviewed. Those who are not invited for an interview will receive notification in writing in March. Applicants must be interviewed in order to be considered for admission.</p> 
       <p>Each month between October and February, the Admissions Committee will select interviewed applicants to be accepted. Letters of acceptance are mailed after each Committee meeting.</p> 
       <p>We operate on a rolling admissions cycle, so if you are interviewed, but not selected for admission at the Committee meeting following your interview, you will still be eligible for selection for admission at all subsequent meetings.</p> 
       <p>When the last Committee meeting takes place in March, and the final round of acceptance letters are mailed, the Committee will determine which interviewed applicants will be offered Alternate Status. Notification of Alternate Status will be communicated via email. Alternates are accepted throughout the summer until the class is filled.</p>

      <p class="faqquestion">After my application is complete, how long will it take before I find out if I am invited for an interview? </p>
      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>The Emory School of Medicine conducts&nbsp;interviews from September through February, and we begin extending&nbsp;interview invitations in August.&nbsp; Invitations to interview are extended right up until the end of the season in late February. The order in which&nbsp;applicants are interviewed is largely (although not entirely) based upon how early the application is completed, so it is always a good idea to complete your application as soon as possible.</p> 
       <p>Interview invitations are extended by email and&nbsp;telephone, so be sure to keep AMCAS and our office&nbsp;updated with any contact information changes.</p>

      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>All the materials and information in an applicant’s file are considered. Although MCAT scores and GPA are the strongest indicators, exceptional letters of recommendation, college and community involvement, and significant experience in a clinical setting are also very important.</p>

      <div class="faqanswer">
       <p>This number varies from year to year and depends upon the decisions of the initially accepted applicants. As we receive withdrawals from accepted students, we look to our alternates to fill the class. Some years we accept less than 10 alternates. Other years we have accepted 30 from the alternate group.</p>

       <p>Once your application is complete, <strong>there is no change in the status of your application&nbsp;</strong> unless you are invited for an interview.
