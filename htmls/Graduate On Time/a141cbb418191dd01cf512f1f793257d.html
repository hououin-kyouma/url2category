        <p>I never went to Bible camp.</p>
        <p>The closest thing I've ever owned to a purity ring is a ring a bought in Nepal, which has the eye of the Buddha.</p>
        <p>Because my mother was raised by her&nbsp;Evangelical aunt and uncle,&nbsp;Christian dogma is just nails on the chalkboard for my mother.</p>
        <p>The only thing I can ever remember my parents — well, let's be honest, mostly my mom — saying to me regarding abstinence was, "Be safe."</p>
        <p>Last week, when I slept over at the apartment of the guy I'm seeing, my dear mother simply commented that I looked like I had been, "rode hard and put away wet" when I came home the next morning.</p>
        <p>(The joke's on her. I just happen to have super long hair that gets tangled easily.)</p>
        <p>But despite all of this, I am the only one in my friend group who is still a virgin at the ripe old age of 19.</p>
        <p>I'm not even remotely religious, and I'm uncertain if I ever want to get married because, as a feminist, I can't get past the idea women were — and in some parts of the world, still — historically considered their husbands' property.</p>
        <p>While I totally respect people who want to wait until marriage, I also question how realistic that mindset is in this day and age.</p>
        <p>For me, virginity symbolizes very little except another item to check off my proverbial bucket list.</p>
        <p>(Spoiler alert: I've already checked off "go to Australia," "hike the Himalayas" and "lick whipped cream off a guy's stomach." That was an interesting night.)</p>
        <p>But somehow, I can't bring myself to go all the way.</p>
        <p>Being a perfectionist, I always imagined losing my virginity would resemble a combination of "The Notebook" and every early Taylor Swift music video.</p>
        <p>I wanted the guy to be my best friend and greatest confidante.</p>
        <p>I also wanted him to be arrestingly handsome (if you catch my drift).</p>
        <p>Do I seem shallow? Well, that's because frankly, I was.</p>
        <p>While I'm realizing I will likely never find the perfect person, regret has never sat well with me.</p>
        <p>I hate the idea of looking back on that milestone and feeling regretful (or worse, neutral) about it.</p>
        <p>Here are six more reasons why I am still a virgin, despite having zero religious motives:</p>
        <h3>1. Women are constantly boxed in as either promiscuous or pure.</h3>
        <p>We're either&nbsp;sluts or prudes&nbsp;and good or bad, as if our characters can be painted in black and white based on our sex lives.</p>
        <p>While I realize the absurdity of this, I still worry about certain people judging me for not "waiting until marriage" or "holding out for Mr. Right."</p>
        <h3>2. Being a virgin makes me feel special and unique.</h3>
        <p>I worry that losing it would cause me to have a total identity crisis.</p>
        <h3>3. If my period is even a day late, I freak out.</h3>
        <p>I do this even though I logically know it's impossible for me to be pregnant.</p>
        <p>If I were sexually active, this would drive me insane with worry.</p>
        <p>As someone who finds babies odd at best and downright icky at worst, the idea of being pregnant sounds like a complete nightmare.</p>
        <h3>4. I've heard so many horror stories about birth control.</h3>
        <p>Also, the pill makes most women gain weight, so...</p>
        <h3>5. I worry that a guy will leave me.</h3>
        <p>I'm also concerned he'll just see me as a nice piece of ass if I have sex with him.</p>
        <h3>6. I want to have something to look forward to after college.</h3>
        <p>Since I have a bit longer before I become a full-fledged adult, I like the idea of having another post-college milestone to look forward to.</p>
        <p>Though I may not necessarily wait all the way until marriage, I want to have something that symbolizes the end of an era.</p>
        <p>For me, sex is one of the biggest adulthood milestones.</p>
        <p>Right now, I couldn't feel further from a true adult.</p>
        <p>I don't have my own apartment, I'm still in school and I haven't started my career yet.</p>
        <p>I want to enjoy my remaining years of youth untethered from the emotional complications of sex.</p>
