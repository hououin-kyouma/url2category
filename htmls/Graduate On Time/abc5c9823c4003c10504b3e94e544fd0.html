          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The <a href="http://www.uncg.edu">University of North Carolina at Greensboro</a> is announcing today that it will allow “highly motivated students” to graduate in three years, beginning with the freshman class that will be seated this fall.</p> 
          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Specifically, the program will be offered to incoming freshmen who already have at least 12 college credit hours, either through Advanced Placement or community college classes, or other accelerated work. By paring a year off their undergraduate experiences, those students would save an estimated $8,000, 0r 22 percent, in tuition, room, board and other fees, compared to their peers in four-year programs. </p> 
          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a statement, Linda P. Brady, the university chancellor, described the program as “perfect for students who are eager to earn a degree and get on with other life goals.” Among the majors for which the accelerated program will be offered are those in accounting, elementary education, information systems and romance languages.</p>

           <p>I think it’s great! As a student who took a year off to work with AmeriCorps, I’ve been a little uneasy about the fact that I won’t get to graduate with my “real class”, the class of 2013. UNCG is currently my top choice school (because of money, and the fact that I’m in the honors college and the Music School), and if Yale doesn’t come through (let’s be honest, it probably won’t) knowing that it has an option to put me on the job market sooner is awesome. </p> 
           <p>I think for the right student, it is a thrilling albeit challenging option, and I’d personally enjoy it immensly!</p>

           <p>Great! and it’s about time. half the moronic requirements that college students take in the first two years are simply what they should have had in high school to begin with. I think it’s great to get kids focused, in their majors and headed for the real world with as little fuss and expense as possible.</p>

           <p>Since UNCG already offers iSchool courses to NC high school students, I am quite sure that the vast majority of students who would opt for a three year program would have plenty of previous UNCG courses already completed. Therefore, they likely would have the equivalent of at least four years within the Greensboro program, if not four years physically on campus. Thus, it is not as revolutionary as it may seem on the surface.</p>

           <p>This strikes me as a public announcement of an already existing trend. The catch phrases are “freshmen with 12 credit hours” and “majors such as accounting, elementary education, information systems and romance languages” (i.e., small majors). A freshman entering college with 12 or more credit hours probably already has enough creds to graduate in three years if his/her major is small and if he/she is willing to take more classes per semester than average. That is, unless the school’s core curriculum is structured such that those freshmens’ credits cannot be applied to the core (which is how a lot of universities structure their core). Now, if the university had decided to restructure its core to allow students to use those credits toward graduation, then that would be something. If so, why only offer it in certain majors? And the phrase “highly motivated students” also catches the eye. That kind of makes me the think that the curricula will be structured such that students will have to take more courses per semester than average. And then, just like early graduating students in the past, you have to know that you want to major in these programs from the beginning. So, this announcement seems rather silly to me. I don’t see that they’re doing anything groundbreaking here. Even so, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, I think that pushing students to graduate in three years is a bad idea. It’s very rare for a freshman to arrive at a university knowing what he/she wants to do. Most college students don’t declare until the end of their sophomore years. When I matriculated, I knew a number of freshman who entered with enough credit hours to place them squarely in their sophomore years, but they didn’t have a clue what they wanted to study. They didn’t graduate any faster than anyone else because they spent their first two years shopping for a major. I also knew people who entered college supposedly knowing what they wanted to major in, but would later change to something else (some as late as in their senior year of college). Only rarely does a freshman enter college knowing what he/she wants to major and actually _sticks_ to that major. I was one such freshman, and I entered with 15 credit hours, but I still graduated in four years for another reason that makes this idea stupid: I was a physical science major. My major was so big that my colleagues who entered without credits had to take several 18-hour semesters and go to summer school just to finish in four years. And they had never changed majors. Now, while admittedly, there were parts of the overall curriculum that we all could have done without such as empty hours (to fill three hours, one of them took a cooking class) or first year language classes that don’t count towards the core, there are just some majors that are big enough that even a minimal core and starting from year one in that major results in graduating in four years. And yet, if you ask those majors what classes they could cut from their majors, they would be hard pressed to come up with one. And while there are some stupid and superfluous things that universities might make a student take, eliminating the core is not a good idea. The core is what makes a college education enriching and rewarding. Take that away and going to college would be nothing more than job training. Really, the idea of pushing students to graduate in three years is nothing more a reflection of our society’s over-emphasis of the economic benefits of a college education (that among other things). We’re thinking way to much of sending students to college so that they can get jobs when they graduate, rather than providing them with an enriching experience while they’re there. One of the good things I can say about academia is that it has continued to resist this trend (though, I note to my dismay, that its resistance is crumbling). And while I think that there’s substantial room to reform college education to more so meet the demands of today, I don’t think treating a college education like job training (or pushing students to graduate in three years) is the way to do it. We have some of the best universities in the world. Students from all over the world, including countries that have systems that this idea is trying to emulate (like England, France, and Germany), are coming _here_ to go to college. So, we must be doing something right.</p> 
           <p>And by the way, implementing a three-year college system probably won’t reduce amount of time people spend in college, in any case. Students will still change majors, lengthening their time to graduation. And further specializing the majors will simply increase the number of people who go back to college later in life because they’ve decided to change careers. Except next time, tuition will be much more expensive.</p>

           <p>This is really not new that schools are doing this. Many schools in the midwest and New England are doing this. Some of these really aren’t three year programs from what I looked into because you take night and weekend courses. The compressed time frame only make it feel like you are saving money tuition wise despite saving money room and board wise.</p>

           <p>At my undergrad school you were welcome to graduate in however many terms it took you to accumulate 120 credits (in the correct distribution; I wound up meeting all my requirements but that 120 total in 7 semesters). </p> 
           <p>If this program is not like that but rather a reduction by 25% or whatever of the number credits needed to graduate, well, I don’t know, why were they making everybody do it the other way for so long?</p>

           <p>This is a great idea, though I bet quite a few people are doing it already. I had fifteen credits already going into college (AP and College in the High School courses), and I’ll be able to graduate a year early, without taking more than an average class load. I always knew I was going to be an English major, so I went into college with a plan, which meant I didn’t have to change tracks later. This is awesome for motivated students!</p>

           <p>Obtaining a Bachelor’s degree in three years is detrimental and will reduce the qualifications of the student for employment or graduate study. It is preferable for a student to take *five* years to complete a Bachelor’s degree and to take all of the courses necessary to become really qualified for graduate school. The minimum math requirements most colleges establish for graduation, even in science and engineering, fall far short of the mathematical education that is actually needed in a career in science and technology. In the humanities, the minimum number of courses one needs to complete a Bachelor’s degree falls far short of the expertise one needs to complete graduate school. The primary exception to this is that students who were raised in certain European countries may be starting college with skills exceeding those of American students, and they might not need to spend four years to achieve the level of an American B.S. or B.A.</p>

           <p>I just graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in December by graduating a semester early. While most schools, mine included, don’t offer an explicit 3 or 3.5 year degree, their graduation requirements are usually in terms of credit hours and you can complete those in 6 semesters without summer or weekend classes. I think that colleges have avoided publicizing this because it would put a serious dent in their income. Paying for a semester at Wash U entitles you to 21 credit hours (approx 7 classes). However, most people take 15 credit hours for the same price and graduate in four years instead of 3. Given their already shaky finances, losing 25% of college tuition income would sink them.</p>

           <p>Is this really worth talking about? Students can finish in three years anywhere, all you have to do is accelerate a little bit. You don’t even need a head start of 12 credits, you can just push yourself a little harder and take summer classes. And, yes, obviously the student will save money, because they’ll be living on campus for a year less and tuition tends to go up, not down, so they’ll save on a little bit of inflated tuition from that fourth year. This is not news.</p>

           <p>I graduated in 3 years from Boston University in the early 80’s. I had enough AP credits to skip many of my requirements, and at the time I thought I wanted to get on with my life. When I look back now, I wish I had stayed that extra year. When I graduated I was 20 years old, (I turned 21 later that summer). I moved to NY the day after graduation to start a full-time job at an advertising agency. While everything worked out okay, I realize now how young I was. I am still wondering why I was in such a rush to go to work every day!</p> 
           <p>I have a son who is a senior in high school right now, and I am advising him to ignore his AP credits and plan on staying in college for the full four years.</p>

           <p>In many majors, this simply cannot work, due to the prerequisite system. Despite coming in with 30+ AP/IB credits, my degree had to take 4 years to complete. You can’t take advanced thermodynamics without a pretty solid grasp of differential equations…</p> 
           <p>I agree that changing majors is also another obstacle: relatively few students entering college, even of the advanced credit subset, are confident in their choice of major. It seems many students spend a year figuring out there major, and then the next 3 actually completing their degree. </p> 
           <p>“Highly motivated students” who know what they want to do can already make the decision to complete a degree in 3 years, and do. Universities establish requirements: are there any that actually say “no, you cannot graduate” after 3 years if all of those requirements have been fulfilled?</p>

           <p>This is a wonderful idea! I think UNC-Greensboro is solidifying what is already a popular trend amongst eager and ambitious college students. I am a recent college graduate; I graduated with my B.S. this past December – it only took me 2 1/2 years. I entered college with transfer credits, and worked with my advisor to plan my courses appropriately. Of course, I attended a small private college, so it was easier to get overrides for the classes I needed. I think this is a wonderful idea, if UNC-Greensboro is going to actually follow through with the red-tape aspect and actually allow students to talk to advisors/professors and get the appropriate planning and paperwork filled out to take the right classes. For the students who are willing to put forth the extra time and energy it takes, it is wonderful that the college is willing to acknowledge their hard work. This is a wonderful idea!</p>

           <p>Most European undergraduate degrees are three years. In some European universities (such as those in Scotland) one can take a 3 year undergraduate degree or a four year “honours” degree.</p>

           <p>What a fuss about nothing! The Irish Minister of Education proposing 2 year degree courses but meeting resistance because this would end the traditional long vac (from mid May to end of September) when many students work to part fund the up-coming year.</p>

           <p>My impression is that state-school students already have trouble graduating in four years because required courses are oversubscribed to the point that it’s impossible to complete major requirements on time.</p> 
           <p>Three years sounds good in theory, but unless a school wants to make the three-year track some type of special honors college, I’m not sure how well the idea will work in practice.</p>

           <p>At my school (University of Chicago), you could graduate when you completed the requirements. They didn’t advertise it, but depending on your major, you could absolutely graduate in three years if you worked hard. Even as a bio major, I could have graduated in three years if I’d taken a full load each quarter – as it was, I graduated in three years + one quarter. </p> 
           <p>I don’t see what’s so special about UNC allowing students to graduate early. “Motivated” students have been doing that for generations already.</p> 
           <p>On the other hand, if a student has money, I’d definitely recommend traveling abroad for a year during college. They’re not going to get the time to do so afterward, so take advantage of those college years!</p>

           <p>There is a strong cultural tide of colleges inching toward various diploma-mill systems, and this is just one more way to do it. For one thing, many people assume that AP courses or AP credits are really college-level work; most are not. </p> 
           <p>Our society has a really hard time right now resisting anything that’s easy and feels good. Telling high-school seniors that they are fifteen credits toward a college degree is easy, and it makes the kids and their parents feel good. Trading money for a diploma is easy and it feels really good. It just doesn’t educate anyone.</p>

           <p>I am opposed to this idea, because I did it. I graduated in three years from an Ivy League school with a double major in 1978. The main reason was my parents pushing me to save money. Yes, I had AP credits, but I also went to summer school &amp; took 18 credits a semester.</p> 
           <p>The reason I think it’s wrong is because college is the magic time between youth and adulthood. You’re probably going to spend 50+ years working, so what’s the rush? Looking back, I missed many experiences with my friends and the time to mature, explore other possibilities, and grow. Saving a few bucks is not worth that loss, IMO.</p> 
           <p>When I go to reunions, I cannot relate to half the stories people tell, and have far fewer contacts than others.</p> 
           <p>Thirty years after college, I remember the experiences and relationships I had, not the course work. As I say, most of my learning took place outside the classroom, not inside.</p> 
           <p>Another way I explain this is college is NOT like saving money for a down payment on a house: the sooner you save the $, the sooner you can move in. </p> 
           <p>Instead, it’s like a trip to Paris: you don’t want to spend 5 minutes at Notre Dame, 5 minutes at the Eiffel Tower, 5 minutes along the Seine, etc., just to say you’ve been there. You need to savor it, take in the experiences, live it. You can’t experience Paris in an afternoon. </p> 
           <p>You miss a great deal of life with only 3 years of college.</p>

           <p>good idea. Combine it with a three year medical school curriculum and we have doctors in 6 years (at a substantial savings) instead of 8.</p> 
           <p>There are several of these programs in the US now.</p>

           <p>You can learn more if you study for four years than if you study for three years. You might get more “credit” per year of school in terms of units, but not more knowledge. It sounds like they are watering down the traditional bachelor’s degree.</p>

           <p>as others have noted, this does not appear to be a new thing. i graduated in 3 years from Carnegie Mellon University in 1990. there was not a formal “3 year program”; it was simply a function of meeting the total credit requirement. If memory serves, the tuition was charged on a per-credit basis?, so I am not certain that there was a huge savings (I can’t recall for certain), but nevertheless there were other benefits to graduating early.</p>
