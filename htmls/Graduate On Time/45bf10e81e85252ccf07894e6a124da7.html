               <div class="faq_answer_simple"> 
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, among first-time college students who enrolled in a community college in the fall of 2010, both part-time and full-time, 39 percent earned a credential from a two- or four-year institution within six years (<a href="https://nscresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/SignatureReport12.pdf" target="_blank">Shapiro et al., 2016</a>).</p> 
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The six-year completion rate for white students who started at a community college in the fall of 2010 was 45.1 percent. For Asian students it was 43.8 percent, for Hispanic students it was 33 percent and for black students it was 25.8 percent (<a href="https://nscresearchcenter.org/signaturereport12-supplement-2/%20" target="_blank">Shapiro et al., 2017</a>).</p> 
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Sixteen percent of students who started at community colleges in 2010 completed a degree at a four-year institution within six years. Most of these bachelor's degree earners (58 percent) did not obtain a two-year degree before transferring (<a href="https://nscresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/SignatureReport12.pdf" target="_blank">Shapiro et al., 2016</a>).&nbsp;Asian and white students who started at community colleges earned bachelor’s degrees at higher rates than the overall average (23 percent and 19 percent respectively). Hispanic (11 percent) and black students (9 percent) earned bachelor’s degrees at rates lower than the average (<a href="https://nscresearchcenter.org/signaturereport12-supplement-2/%20" target="_blank">Shapiro et al., 2017</a>).</p> 
                <p>Because the graduation rate used for federal accountability purposes only includes completions that occur at the starting institution, it does not account for students who transfer without first earning a degree. Community colleges therefore do not receive credit for many students who earn a degree at another institution. The three-year graduation rate for first-time, full-time degree/certificate-seeking students who started at two-year institutions in fall 2010—the U.S. Department of Education’s measurement—was 29 percent. When the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center included full-time students who finished at another institution and extended the tracking period to six years, the number reached 55 percent (<a href="https://nscresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/SignatureReport12.pdf" target="_blank">Shapiro et al., 2016</a>).</p>

                <p>Students who complete their remedial courses are more likely than partial completers or noncompleters to stay in college and get a bachelor’s degree.

                <p style="margin-bottom:16px;">Most acceleration strategies fall into two broad approaches, <i>course restructuring</i> and <i>mainstreaming</i>.</p> 
                <p style="margin-bottom:16px;"><strong>Course restructuring models</strong> reorganize instructional time or modify the curriculum to reduce the time necessary to fulfill developmental education requirements. <i>Compressed courses</i> allow students to complete multiple sequential courses in one semester. <i>Curricular redesign</i> involves removing redundant content from the developmental sequence and modifying the remaining curriculum to align more closely with college-level requirements, allowing the removal of one or more developmental courses from the sequence. <i>Modularized approaches</i> accelerate students’ progress by customizing instruction (usually via online learning) so that students can focus on the competencies they need for success in a particular academic pathway.</p> 
                <p><strong>Mainstreaming models</strong> accelerate students’ progress by placing students referred to developmental education directly into college-level courses. <i>Mainstreaming with supplemental support</i> involves placing students with developmental education referrals directly into introductory college-level courses and providing additional instruction through mandatory companion classes, lab sessions, or other learning supports. <i>Basic skills integration</i> is a form of contextualization and involves placing students directly into college-level occupational courses and that integrate relevant basic skills instruction (<a target="_blank" href="/media/k2/attachments/accelerating-achievement-developmental-education-brief.pdf">Edgecombe, 2011</a>; <a target="_blank" href="/media/k2/attachments/accelerated-developmental-education.pdf">Jaggars, Edgecombe, &amp; Stacey, 2014</a>).</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">CCRC has studied four different acceleration strategies at four different colleges and college systems across the country. In each analysis, accelerated students were compared to a matched set of students with similar placement exam scores who proceeded through a longer developmental sequence.</p> 
                <p>In all four studies, accelerated students were significantly more likely to complete college-level math or English within one and three years. Students in accelerated English developmental education accrued more college-level credits within one and three years than students in the traditional sequence. Students in accelerated math developmental education were not more likely to accrue more college-level credits (<a target="_blank" href="/media/k2/attachments/accelerated-developmental-education.pdf">Jaggars, Edgecombe, &amp; Stacey, 2014</a>).</p>

Among those students, the completion rate for all online courses was 8.2 percentage points lower than the completion rate for face-to-face courses; completion rates for online English and math courses were lower by 12.8 percent and 9.8 percent, respectively.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Of the 33 percent of community college students who transfer to four-year colleges, 42 percent complete a bachelor’s degree within six years. In other words, 14 percent of the entire cohort of entering community college students earns a bachelor's degree within six years (<a href="/publications/tracking-transfer-institutional-state-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">Jenkins &amp; Fink, 2016</a>).</p> 
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Bachelor’s completion rates are higher among students who earn an associate degree or certificate before transferring. Among community college students who transfer with an associate degree, 48 percent complete a bachelor’s degree within six years of starting at a community college, compared with 35 percent of community college students who transfer without an associate degree. One study (<a href="http://nscresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/SignatureReport5.pdf" target="_blank">Shapiro et al., 2013</a>) tracked students six years after they transferred (up to 10 years total) and found that while 62 percent completed a bachelor’s degree, 72 percent of those who transferred with an associate degree earned a bachelor’s degree, compared with only 56 percent of those who transferred without first having earned an associate degree. A recent CCRC study, however, found that while there was a positive correlation nationally between community colleges' transfer-with-award rates and their transfer-out bachelor's completion rates, this association varied by state and was not significant in most states (<a href="/publications/tracking-transfer-institutional-state-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">Jenkins &amp; Fink, 2016, endnote 17</a>).</p> 
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Bachelor’s completion varies by type of four-year institution. Of students who transfer to four-year public institutions (73 percent of all transfers), 42 percent complete a bachelor’s within six years of starting at a community college. Of students who transfer to private nonprofit four-year institutions (19 percent of all transfers), 31 percent complete a bachelor’s within six years. Of students who transfer to private for-profit four-year institutions (9 percent of all transfers), 8 percent complete a bachelor’s within six years . Additionally, among students who transfer to very selective four-year institutions (17 percent of all transfers), 58 percent complete a bachelor’s degree within six years. Of transfers to moderately selective and nonselective four-year institutions (53 percent and 27 percent of all transfers, respectively), 39 percent and 22 percent complete bachelor’s degrees within six years of starting at a community college (<a href="/publications/tracking-transfer-institutional-state-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">Jenkins &amp; Fink, 2016</a>).</p> 
                <p><a href="http://nscresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/SignatureReport5.pdf" target="_blank">Shapiro et al. (2013)</a> found that transfer students who enrolled full-time were significantly more likely to attain a bachelor’s degree six years after transfer (80 percent) than students who switched between full- and part-time enrollment (55 percent) and students who enrolled exclusively part-time (25 percent).</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">On average, community college students earn significantly more over their lifetimes than individuals who do not go to community college. Many studies have shown higher earnings for community college awards (<a href="/publications/benefits-attending-community-college.html" target="_blank">Belfield &amp; Bailey, 2011</a>).</p> 
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">But the exact amount varies. It depends on what subject is studied; if the student transfers to a four-year college; if the labor market is strong; and, most importantly, if the student completes community college.</p> 
                <p>Based on large-scale studies from six states, the average student who completes an associate degree at a community college will earn $5,400 more each working year than a student who drops out of community college. This estimate adjusts for factors such as the subject studied, college attended, and college GPA (<a href="http://capseecenter.org/is-college-worth-it-and-for-whom/" target="_blank">Bailey &amp; Belfield, 2015</a>).</p>

                <p>Most research finds that having a certificate is associated with higher earnings; the effect is especially strong for certificates in health fields. In addition, certificates increase the probability that the person is employed and that the job is in an industry related to their skills (<a href="/publications/what-about-certificates.html" target="_blank">Xu &amp; Trimble, 2015</a>).</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Tuition and fees at community colleges are approximately $4,000 per year of full-time study (<a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76" target="_blank">NCES, Digest of Education Statistics 2013, Table 330.10</a>). By comparison, a student who completes an associate degree will earn on average $5,400 more than a dropout each year. This gap appears within eight years of first enrollment (<a href="http://capseecenter.org/is-college-worth-it-and-for-whom/" target="_blank">Bailey &amp; Belfield, 2015</a>).
