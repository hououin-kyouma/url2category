        <p class="answer">A. Several types of holds and reasons exist. Most typical is the adviser approval hold, which only your adviser can release. Please make an appointment to meet with your adviser before the beginning of registration for each semester. Your adviser will remove the registration hold after your meeting.</p> 
        <p class="answer">Registrar holds may be placed on your account for various reasons, including failure to submit a <strong>Consent to Release Academic Information</strong>; failure to declare a major in the fourth semester; and missing transfer credit materials. Contact the Office of Academic Services for the College of Arts and Science for assistance with getting this hold removed</p>

        <p class="question"> <a id="kb1"> </a>Q. What is Senior Reexamination?</p> 
        <p class="answer">A. A candidate for graduation who fails not more than one course in the final semester may be allowed one reexamination, provided the course failed prevents the student’s graduation, and provided the student could pass the course by passing a reexamination. Certain courses may be excluded from reexamination. The reexamination must be requested through the student’s dean’s office, and if approved, it is given immediately after the close of the last semester of the student’s senior year. A student who passes the reexamination will receive a D– in the course.</p>

        <p class="question"> <a id="kb2"> </a>Q. Where can I get a verification/certification of enrollment?</p> 
        <p class="answer">A. The Office of the University Registrar provides certification of past or current enrollment dates. Requests may be made by phone, letter, or fax. Enrollment Certifications are often requested for health insurance companies, scholarship agencies, potential employers, and credit agencies. Perhaps the most common reason students request enrollment certifications is to defer student loans.<br> <br> For more information: <a href="http://registrar.vanderbilt.edu/academic.htm" target="_blank">http://registrar.vanderbilt.edu/academic.htm</a>.</p>

        <p class="answer"> <br> <br> <strong>Grade Point Average</strong> <br> Divide quality points by quality hours. Quality hours are the hours for which a student has registered, excluding courses taken for no credit, those from which the student has officially withdrawn, and those completed with the grade P. <br> <br> Example:<br> <br> A student registered for 17 credit hours earns the following grades in the 3 credit hour courses: B, B+, A-, A-, and earns a grade of B+ in a 5 credit hour course. To determine the quality points, multiply the grade points by the credit hours and add all course quality points together: (3 x 3.0) + (3 x 3.3) + (3 x 3.7) + (3 x 3.7) + (5 x 3.3) = 57.60 quality points. Divide the quality points earned by the registered hours: 57.60/17 = 3.388 (term GPA). <br> <br> *You can also see your official GPA via the Access to Academic Information application in YES.</p>

        <p class="question"> <a id="kb8"> </a>Q. What are requirements for Dean's List?</p> 
        <p class="answer">A. Students are named to the A&amp;S Dean's List when they earn a grade point average of at least 3.5000 while carrying 12 or more graded credit hours, with no temporary or missing grades in any course (credit or non-credit), and no grade of F.</p>

        <p class="question"> <a id="kb9"> </a>Q. I want to repeat a course. What is the policy?</p> 
        <p class="answer">A. If a course was failed the last time it was taken, credit is awarded when the course is repeated with a passing grade. If a course was previously passed, <strong>NO NEW CREDIT IS EARNED</strong>. If a course previously passed is repeated and failed, credit originally earned for it is lost. <br> <br> In any case, all grades earned are shown on the transcript. Under conditions explained below, the most recent grade in a course replaces the previous grade in determining credit, in computing the grade point average, and in verifying the completion of degree requirements and progress toward the degree. <br> <br> Students are cautioned that while repeating for grade replacement a course previously passed may improve their cumulative grade point average, it may also lead to a problem in meeting minimum hours requirements for class standing/graduation because no new credit is earned. <br> <br> The policy of grade replacement applies when all of the conditions below are met. <br> <br> 1. A previously passed course is repeated within one year or (for courses not offered within a year) the first time it is offered. Passed courses may be repeated only once. Failed courses may be repeated at any time and any number of times. <br> <br> 2. Exactly the same course (same department and course number) is completed. (A very small number of differently numbered courses as approved by the faculty may be substituted under this policy. These are designated in the departmental course listings.) <br> <br> 3. The course is repeated on a regularly graded basis. This limitation applies even if the course was originally taken on a P/F basis. <br> <br> 4. The course is not one in independent study or directed study. <br> <br> In most instances, enrollment in a course similar to one already completed but with a different course number will result in the award of no credit for the second course and will have no effect on the grade point average. <br> <br> Courses taken in the College of Arts and Science may not be repeated elsewhere for grade replacement; nor may courses taken elsewhere be repeated in the College of Arts and Science for grade replacement.</p>
