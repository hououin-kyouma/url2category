       <h2>Student Grants</h2> 
      </div> 
      <div class="post-img"> 
      </div> 
      <div class="post-entry"> 
       <p> The cost of attending college has more than doubled since 1980. Public universities now average $12,283 annually and private universities have exceeded $31,233, according to the <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76" target="_blank">United States Department of Education</a>. Community colleges had once been considered the affordable way to attend college, but even their price tags have risen over the years. Even with college savings plans, the average citizen finds it difficult to come up with that much money for four years in a row. This situation has led to many students taking out immense student loan debt, stretching their college attendance over five years or more, or even dropping out of school altogether. Fortunately, students have access to a funding source that can help them graduate from college quickly and possibly be debt-free at the end.</p> 
       <h2>Benefit of Student Grants <img src="http://www.studentgrants.org/images/college-girl.jpg" align="right"> </h2> 
       <p> A student grant is essentially free money that is given to a student to help with college expenses. Grant awards range from a few hundred dollars to “full ride” packages that pay for the entire cost of an education. The majority of student grants fall between $500 to $2000. Each year these types of grants provide significant benefits to millions of people across the United States. For example, a few thousand dollars can:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>let a disadvantaged minority teenager be the first person in his family to go to college,</li> 
        <li>help a single mother to return to college and get a better job,</li> 
        <li>encourage bright minds to continue exploring new ideas and innovations,</li> 
        <li>assist students young and old to embrace other cultures and promote peaceful international relations,</li> 
        <li>help an unemployed, older student to receive job training and return to the workforce,</li> 
        <li>help working adults to pursue graduate study while still being able to feed their families, and</li> 
        <li>permit ethnically, socially, economically, and financially diverse students to attend the colleges, universities, and vocational schools that they choose.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p> Student grants may be used to pay for tuition, fees, books, research materials, study abroad, living expenses, and many other education-related expenses. Students should keep in mind that little difference exists between grants, scholarships, and fellowships. Anyone looking for financial aid should investigate all three categories.</p> 
       <h2>Repayment of Grants</h2> 
       <p> As people become more and more conscious of their debts, they are hesitant to accept certain financial aid packages. Fortunately, student grants are not like student loans. </p> 
       <p> Student loans must be repaid within a certain timeframe after graduation or the last date of college attendance. They are essentially cash advances to pay for education. Just like credit cards, student loans tack on interest and can soon grow to an insurmountable level. On the other hand, under most circumstances, grants do not need to be repaid. They are gifts from sponsors that help pay for rising tuition bills, university and course fees, transportation costs, and housing expenses. Grants are always applied to tuition bills before loans, and the more grants and scholarships that students have, the less loan debt that must be repaid in the future. </p> 
       <p> Some organizations do, however, attach requirements to grant funding and will demand the repayment of grants if those conditions are not met. For example, certain federal teaching grants mandate that graduates teach in low-income school districts for a certain number of years in order to retain their grant status. Otherwise, the funds will be converted into student loans that must be repaid. Some medical school and nursing program pay for all costs of attending college in exchange for at least two years of service in disadvantaged areas or locations with a shortage of medical personnel. If a grant carries any of these stipulations, the criteria will be identified on the application document. Most organizations are upfront about these requirements because they do not want to risk non-payment later. </p> 
       <h2>Sources of Grants</h2> 
       <p> Student grants can come from just about anywhere–from employers, professional associations, clubs, community groups, colleges, state and local governments, and, of course, the federal government. Many financial aid administrators keep records of all the grants for which their students have applied and then pass those funding sources along to future students. In addition, many websites list thousands of grants and scholarships that are open to qualified applicants. Since some student grants receive low publicity (and low competition), students should apply for more than just the high-profile programs.</p> 
       <p> The four main sources of grants are federal, state, college-specific, and private programs. Details and examples of each category are below:</p> 
       <h3>Federal Grants</h3> 
       <p> Much of the grant money that students receive is awarded through the U.S. government. Federal government grants are used to encourage college attendance, increase the United States’ global competitiveness, and enhance economic output. Current programs include Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grants, Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grants, Academic Competitiveness Grants, National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grants, and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants. These student grants are both need-based and merit-based.</p>

       <p> Level: Undergraduate</p> 
       <p> Pell Grants are a common source of funding for undergraduate students who have not yet earned their first bachelor’s degrees. According to the <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=31">U.S. Department of Education</a>, 27% of all undergraduates had been presented Pell Grants for 2007-2008, with an average grant award of $2,600. These grants are awarded based on financial need. They take into consideration the cost of attendance, year-round or partial-year attendance, and full-time or part-time status. The current cap on Pell Grants is $5,550 per academic year (July 1 – June 30), with funding available for up to 18 semesters.</p> 
       <p> <strong>Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grants (FSEOG)</strong></p> 
       <p> Level: Undergraduate</p> 
       <p> Eligibility under the FSEOG program is based on extreme financial need. Priority status is given to students who have qualified for Pell Grants and who possess the lowest Expected Family Contributions (EFCs) based on their FAFSA results. FSEOG funding is based on application date, financial need, school funding, and the school’s financial aid policies. Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grants typically range between $100 and $4,000 per academic year. In 2008-2009, the top five locations providing the highest average <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/finaid/prof/resources/data/databook2010/databook2010.html">FSEOGs</a> had been the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, Vermont, Hawaii, and Massachusetts.</p> 
       <p> <strong>Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants</strong></p> 
       <p> Level: Undergraduate, Post-Baccalaureate, Graduate</p> 
       <p> TEACH Grants are offered to students who commit to serving as full-time teachers in high-need fields in public/private elementary or secondary schools that serve low-income students. Example of high-need fields include mathematics, science, reading specialists, foreign languages, bilingual education, English language acquisition, and special education. Within eight years of graduation, grant recipients must teach for at least four academic years. If these stipulations are not met, the grants will be retroactively converted to Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, interest will accumulate, and students will be responsible for repaying the money. </p> 
       <p> TEACH Grants are awarded for up to $4,000 per year. According to the U.S. Department of Education’s http://www2.ed.gov/finaid/prof/resources/data/teach-institution.html”&gt;records, in 2009-2010, Pacific Lutheran University distributed the highest TEACH Grant award per student at $4,850, while Arizona State University presented over $4 million in TEACH Grants to 1,325 students–the highest in the nation. For more details on what the federal government considers to be a high-need field or a school serving low-income students, review the TEACH Grant <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/PORTALSWebApp/students/english/TEACH.jsp">program profile</a>. </p> 
       <p> <strong>Academic Competitiveness Grant (ACG)</strong></p> 
       <p> Level: Undergraduate</p> 
       <p> Awarded to students who have graduated from rigorous high school programs, the Academic Competitiveness Grants are set at $750 for first-year college students and $1300 for second-year college students. Additional eligibility requirements can be found at the U.S. Department of Education’s <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/PORTALSWebApp/students/english/AcademicGrants.jsp?tab=funding">ACG profile</a>.</p> 
       <p> <strong>National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grant (National SMART Grant)</strong></p> 
       <p> Level: Undergraduate</p> 
       <p> The National SMART Grant is designed to enhance the United States’ global competitiveness in the areas of mathematics, technology, engineering, physical science, life science, computer science, critical foreign languages, and non-major single liberal arts. To be eligible for SMART Grants, students must major in one of these areas and maintain at least a 3.0 GPA. SMART Grants are available during the third and fourth years of undergraduate study, with a limit of $4,000 per year. </p> 
       <p> <strong>Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant</strong></p> 
       <p> Level: Undergraduate</p> 
       <p> The Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant is offered to students who do not meet the requirements for the Pell Grant but whose parent or guardian died as a result of U.S. Armed Forces service performed after September 11, 2001 in Iraq or Afghanistan. Students must be younger than 24 and enrolled in college at least part-time at the time of the parent or guardian’s death. The Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant is capped at the Pell Grant limit.</p> 
       <p> <strong>Applying for Federal Grants</strong></p> 
       <p> Students who are interested in applying for federal grants must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). To receive federal aid, each student must meet all of the following criteria:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>be a U.S. citizen or qualified non-citizen (such as permanent residents, conditional permanent residents, students granted certain visa or refugee statuses by the Department of Homeland Security, and citizens of certain island nations)</li> 
        <li>possess a valid Social Security Number</li> 
        <li>hold a high school diploma or GED</li> 
        <li>be enrolled or intending to enroll at an approved higher education institution</li> 
        <li>register with Selective Service, if a male aged 18 to 25</li> 
        <li>not be in default on any federal loan or grant</li> 
        <li>promise to use federal grants and loans on educational and housing expenses only</li> 
        <li>demonstrate satisfactory academic progress while taking courses</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p> The deadline for filing the FAFSA is June 30 for each academic year, but students are encouraged to apply early for access to the most aid. FAFSA processing can take up to six weeks, so apply well before any federal, state, or college deadlines. For the best financial aid opportunities, students should complete the FAFSA with estimated or actual income tax return numbers each January before the next academic year starts in July. Most grant programs require the FAFSA to be completed annually for renewal purposes.</p> 
       <p> The FAFSA process can be overwhelming the first time, but the FAFSA renewal for subsequent years pre-fills much of the information. The FAFSA must be completed for every academic year that grants, loans, and other financial aid awards are being requested. To speed up the application process, have the following details nearby:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Social Security Number</li> 
        <li>Driver’s license number</li> 
        <li>Previous year’s W-2 forms</li> 
        <li>Previous year’s federal income tax return for yourself, your spouse if you are married, and your parents if you are a dependent student</li> 
        <li>Current bank statements and investment records</li> 
        <li>Alien registration or permanent resident card for non-citizens</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p> Students can complete the online FAFSA application, download a paper application, or request an application to be mailed to them at <a href="http://fafsa.ed.gov">http://fafsa.ed.gov</a>. </p> 
       <h3>State Grants</h3> 
       <p> Several states offer student grants under various conditions, such as attending a college or university in the state, being a resident of the state, and/or gaining education with the purpose of serving one of the state’s specific needs. </p> 
       <p> For example, in Texas, the TEXAS Grant helps residents with financial need to go to a public college or university. In the same way, the Tuition Equalization Grant Program helps students go to private, non-profit colleges and universities in Texas.</p> 
       <p> In New York, part-time undergraduate students may be eligible to receive the Aid for Part-Time Study (APTS) grant for up to $2,000 per year. The New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) awards grants of up to $5,000 per year to New York residents studying full-time at approved schools. </p> 
       <p> In addition to Cal Grants, students in California can receive other state-based aid. For instance, the Child Development Grant Program awards an annual need-based grant to students pursuing a Child Development Permit. For each year the grant is accepted, students must work full-time for at least one year in a licensed children’s center. The Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents Grant Program (LEPD) is another need-based California grant that can be awarded to the dependents and spouses of select law enforcement personnel.</p> 
       <p> Individual colleges process some state grants with FAFSA information, while other grant programs require additional application materials. A link to each state’s higher education authority, with grant and other financial aid information, is accessible <a href="http://wdcrobcolp01.ed.gov/Programs/EROD/org_list.cfm?category_ID=SHE">here.</a></p> 
       <h3>College Grants</h3> 
       <p> In combination with federal and state grants, many colleges administer their own grant programs. In addition, various external organizations help pay for students to attend a particular college or a specific classification of college, such as a law school grants, teaching grants, nursing grants, medical school grants, cosmetology grants, and trade school grants. Some programs require the college to be accredited by a certain body; others are open to any accreditation. Most colleges and universities automatically check if students have submitted FAFSA records to their institution before calculating the financial aid packages. Students who have completed the FAFSA should see federal, state, and college grants listed on their financial aid award letters. </p> 
       <p> Noted below are some examples of college-based grants:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Florida State University gives up to $1,800 per year to eligible undergraduate and graduate students under the FSU Grant.</li> 
        <li>Northwestern University gives up to $3,000 toward scholarly research for PhD students in the social sciences or humanities and toward creative endeavors by MFA students.</li> 
        <li>At the University of Colorado, the Student Fee Grant offsets up to 20% of the Student Capital Construction Fee.</li> 
        <li>The University of California at Berkeley offers a DSP Student Grant to help disabled students with the cost of assistive technology and specialized equipment.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p> Students who are interested in college-specific grants should contact their financial aid departments. They should also meet with their academic departments, as some academic departments award grants that are not available to the university community as a whole. Students should be aware that college grants may have different application deadlines than federal or state grants.</p> 
       <p> Additionally, some colleges choose to use customized Need Access forms through <a href="http://www.needaccess.org">http://www.needaccess.org</a>. The instructions for each grant will identify whether the Need Access form must be completed.</p> 
       <h3>Private Grants</h3> 
       <p> Numerous private entities recognize the importance of higher education. These employers, community organizations, professional associations, and credit unions set aside money to help students with financial need or outstanding academic merit to achieve success. </p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>One example is Educational Employees Credit Union in the Central San Joaquin Valley of California, which pays for some of its student members to attend U.S.-based community colleges, universities, and vocational schools.</li> 
        <li>Another example is the GE Foundation and its STAR Awards program, which gives up to $3,500 to the children of eligible GE employees and retirees.</li> 
        <li>Baptist Memorial Health Care in Tennessee uses its student grants to pay for up to four years of tuition for qualified nursing and allied health students.</li> 
        <li>The Hopi Indian Nation offers the Hopi Education Award of up to $2,500 per semester to Hopi member students who are pursuing AA, BS, BA, Doctoral, or Professional degrees from qualified colleges or universities.</li> 
        <li>The Geological Society of America gives grants to members who are conducting masters-level or doctoral-level research in a geologic earth science degree program at an American, Canadian, Mexican, or Central American university.</li> 
        <li>The Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation supplies up to $30,000 for college juniors to continue their education in public service/government graduate degree programs. These student grants are competitive; approximately 10% of applicants are selected for the award. In addition to the application, the Truman Scholarship requires a nomination from the student’s school, three letters of recommendation, a policy proposal, and a recent transcript. Details about becoming a Truman Scholar are available <a href="http://www.truman.gov/for-candidates/how-to-become-a-truman-scholar">here</a>.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <h2>Types of Grants</h2> 
       <p> Some people are under the misconception that they are not qualified for grants because they or their parents “make too much.” Other students believe that grants are out of their league because they are not academic superstars. Still others think that student grants are only intended for young people and undergraduate study, while others think grants are always project-based with official proposals and timelines. The following information will help correct these misunderstandings.</p> 
       <h3>Clearing Up Myths</h3> 
       <ul> 
        <li>An individual does not necessarily need straight A’s to qualify for a student grant.</li> 
        <li>College grants are for everyone, from graduating high schoolers to mid-level professionals entering graduate school to mature adults returning to college to complete a lifelong dream.</li> 
        <li>Grants can be based on financial need, academic merit, particular talents, or project proposals.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p> Some grants are need-based, which means that individual awards are distributed based on financial need and are intended to send students to college who might not otherwise have the opportunity. Grants can also be merit-based, which means that students must qualify through academic performance, proposal submission, project completion, or other criteria. Some grants require only a simple application, while others demand weeks of preparation. Some grants are dedicated to public schools, some to private schools, and some to any accredited college, university, or vocational school. While the majority of grants are intended for undergraduates, graduate student grants are plentiful. </p> 
       <h2>Level-based Grants</h2> 
       <p> Level-based grants are limited to students with a particular academic standing or education objective. For instance, a grant may be open to any individuals entering a graduate degree program–no matter what degrees they already hold–or restricted to current undergraduate students who are planning to continue their education with their first master’s degree or doctorate. Some student grants are open to all levels.</p> 
       <p> <strong>Freshmen:</strong></p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>The MSU Freshman Grant is automatically disbursed to new freshmen at Michigan State University who complete the FAFSA, are Michigan residents, and demonstrate financial need.</li>

       </ul> 
       <h2>Public College Grants Vs. Private College Grants</h2> 
       <p> Some grants can be used only at public institutions of higher ed while others are confined to private colleges and universities. These types of student grants are often seen in college-specific aid packages, but they may also originate from external organizations.</p>

       </ul> 
       <p> Many grants are based on a person’s major and are limited to a particular college. Education majors, English majors, biology students, nursing students, business students, engineers, police officers, scientists, and musicians can all find an array of worthwhile grants.</p> 
       <h2>Need-based vs Merit-based Grants</h2> 
       <h3>Need-based Grants</h3> 
       <p> As previously mentioned, the Pell Grant is one student grant that is based on financial need. Other examples of need-based grants include the Penn Grant from the University of Pennsylvania, the University of North Carolina Need Based Grant, the Guaranteed Access Grant open to Maryland residents, and the Winston-Salem Foundation’s various grant and scholarship programs for area students.</p> 
       <p> Students should keep in mind that need-based grants do not only go to “poor” students. According to <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education/articles/2008/04/10/how-can-i-improve-my-chances-of-getting-need-based-grants">U.S. News</a>, the majority of federal aid goes to students with household incomes under $50,000, but some colleges award grants and scholarships up to $180,000. Furthermore, Ivy League schools do not grant athletic scholarships or merit scholarships; all aid is need-based.</p> 
       <h3>Merit-based Grants</h3> 
       <p> Merit grants are typically awarded to students with high GPAs, extracurricular involvement, and community service experience. Individual programs may maintain more or fewer requirements. Unlike need-based grants, merit grants do not factor in whether or not a student displays a financial hardship. </p> 
       <p> For the 2009-2010 academic year, <a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/most-merit-aid">U.S. News</a> had listed the colleges that distribute the most non-need-based merit aid. The rankings do not include athletic scholarships or tuition benefits. Topping the list is Louisiana College, in which 88% of students had received merit grants and scholarships, followed by Cooper Union, Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, Free Will Baptist Bible College, University of Central Oklahoma, and Hawaii Pacific University. Some of the awards are based on academic merits alone, whereas others include college-generated scholarships for qualified students who could not afford the cost of attendance.</p> 
       <p> Listed below are a few of the thousands of merit-based grants and scholarships found across the country:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>The ECCHO Scholarship is available to Hispanic students with at least a 2.5 GPA or 450 GED score who are attending their first undergraduate program at a qualified Educators and Community Helping Hispanics Onward (ECCHO) member school.</li> 
        <li>The Alaska Performance Scholarship is granted by the state to students who graduate high school with strong GPAs, college entrance test scores, and rigorous coursework. Students will receive up to $4,755 to attend accredited Alaska colleges, universities, and job-training schools.</li> 
        <li>The National Restaurant Association Education Foundation offers various merit-based scholarships to students and educators in the food service industry.</li> 
        <li>The Elks National Foundation provides Legacy Awards of $1,000 for each of four years to children and grandchildren of living Elks.</li> 
        <li>The EnergySolutions Foundation awards $2,000 merit scholarships to students who will enroll in math, science, and engineering bachelor’s degree programs. These student grants are open to 10th graders in Washington, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and Canada.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <h3>Talent-Based Grants</h3> 
       <p> Talent-based student grants are merit grants or need-based grants for students who demonstrate excellence in a particular area of study. They generally promote specific fields or careers, such as sports, music, theatre, painting, sculpture, dance, math, science, medicine, photography, videography, and any number of other areas. Some talent-based student grants are limited to members of certain organizations, while others are open to anyone in the community. </p> 
       <p> Earning a talent-based grant can not only reduce the burden of going to college but also impress future employers. Examples of talent grants include the following:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>The Minnesota State University at Mankato awards talent grants to high school seniors in the categories of music, theatre, creative writing, communications, and diversity awareness.</li> 
        <li>Talent-based student grants at Rhode Island College are available in dance, music, film studies, theatre, art, and communications. Awards range from $100 to $2,500.</li> 
        <li>The University of Hartford considers athletic scholarships to be part of its talent-based awards. Recipients must participate in NCAA Division I athletics in the areas of baseball, basketball, golf, lacrosse, soccer, or tennis (for men) and basketball, cross-country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, or volleyball (for women).</li> 
        <li>The Gertrude Whitney Conner Scholarship for Excellence gives up to $10,000 to incoming MFA students at the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting, and Sculpture who demonstrate artistic ability and financial need.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <h3>Project-based Grants</h3> 
       <p> Project grants are awarded on a competitive basis, usually for scientific research, advanced technologies, the arts, and social services. Project grants are usually prestigious, so winning an award can open doors to future grant projects and employment offers. Some popular project-based student grants are listed below:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Fulbright Grants are some of the most well-known project grants. Fulbright Grants are administered through the Institute of International Education, with sponsorship from the U.S. Department of State. These grants permit undergraduate students, graduate students, and recent graduates to undertake advanced study, research, and teaching opportunities abroad. Fulbright Grants last nine to twelve months, and competition is intense. More information for both U.S. students and non-U.S. students can be found <a href="http://www.iie.org/fulbright">here</a>.</li> 
        <li>The American Medical Association gives medical students the opportunity to plan and execute community projects through their Chapter Involvement Grant program. These student grants offer awards of $150 to $500 per event. Each project must be related to medical education, medical practice, public health, patient safety, and/or community outreach. More details can be found <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/medical-student-section/community-service/frequently-asked-questions-about-chapter-involvement.shtml">here</a>.</li>

       </ul> 
       <h2>Demographic-based Grants</h2> 
       <p> Demographic grants are awarded based on a student’s particular characteristics, a student’s desire to explore a certain field or career, or a combination of the two. Common demographic-based programs include minority grants, women grants, Native American grants, Hispanic grants, gay/lesbian grants, and religious grants. </p> 
       <p> As previously mentioned, demographic-based grants may or may not be limited to people who display select traits themselves. For instance, an African American Studies grant may be open only to African Americans or may accept applications from people of all races who want to study African American culture and heritage. A GLBT grant may be given to gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender students with any majors, to any student with a GLBT-related major, or to a GLBT student with a GLBT major. The same principles apply for religion-based grants. Student grants may be provided to individuals who practice a certain religion, to any student who wants to attend a college with a particular religious affiliation, to students intending to start a religious career, or to any combination of the aforementioned characteristics.</p>

       <h2>How to Find Student Grants</h2> 
       <p> This year, nearly $3 billion in financial aid will be distributed. Due to the immense number of student grants, finding a grant is easy, but finding the right grant may be difficult. The most common ways to locate grants are:</p> 
       <h3>Friends</h3> 
       <p> Ask friends what grant applications they submitted. Talk to friends who are attending the same college and different colleges, who have the same major and different majors, who live in the same area and outside the area, who possess the same interests and different interests, who work for the same employer and different employers, and who share the same interests and different interests. Requesting grant advice from people who are in a similar situation may lead to one-track thinking, while speaking to people in a variety of circumstances may identify previously undiscovered grant opportunities.</p> 
       <h3>Financial Aid Administrators</h3> 
       <p> Representatives who work in the financial aid office have a strong grasp of not only their own college’s grant options but also the grants provided by nearby schools and organizations. They can often steer students toward both widely recognized publications and little-known resources.</p> 
       <h3>College Publications</h3> 
       <p> Read college newspapers, listen to college radio stations, and review university websites. Most institutions publish their grant and scholarship deadlines, and current students are likely to talk about hot items.</p> 
       <h3>Professional Associations</h3> 
       <p> Career-specific organizations often publish advice to help students through college and gain employment in the field. Many organizations offer student grants themselves.</p> 
       <h3>Website Listings</h3> 
       <p> The huge demand for student grants has lead to the indexing and cataloging of numerous funding sources. Large grants, small grants, full grants, partial grants, high-profile grants, and nondescript grants are all accessible. Performing a simple Internet search can lead to pages and pages of information. </p> 
       <h3>Student Grant Services</h3> 
       <p> Some services offer to scour online and offline sources for the latest student grant opportunities. For a fee, they match students and grants based on financial need, merit, talents, demographics, location, selected colleges, connections with associations and employers, cultural heritage, interests, career plans, and more. Some of these student grant services provide immense value and are worth their price. Other times, students can save a substantial amount of time and money by conducting their own research.</p> 
       <h2>Tips on Applying for Student Grants</h2> 
       <p> 1. Consider your characteristics. Each year grants are awarded to thousands of individuals on a virtually unlimited number of traits. Some common grant categories include:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li><strong>Citizenship status: </strong>American citizens attending a U.S. college or university, foreign residents attending a U.S. college or university, children of immigrants</li> 
        <li><strong>Education level:</strong> undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, graduate</li> 
        <li><strong>College type:</strong> public, private, non-profit, law school, medical school, film school, community college, four-year institution, vocational or trade school</li> 
        <li><strong>College location: </strong>state or region, college-specific</li> 
        <li><strong>Class:</strong> freshman, sophomore, junior, senior</li> 
        <li><strong>Financial need: </strong>need-based or merit-based, low-income only</li> 
        <li><strong>Enrollment status:</strong> full-time, part-time</li> 
        <li><strong>Major:</strong> with and without future employment requirements</li> 
        <li><strong>Future occupation:</strong> nursing, childcare, education, visual artist, zoologist, firefighters, etc.</li> 
        <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, military status, disabilities, past/present medical conditions, and more</li> 
        <li><strong>Family situation: </strong>single mother, single father, pregnant women, unwed mothers, married with children, working adult, dependent with one or more parents deceased, children of divorced parents, adopted children</li> 
        <li><strong>Current employer:</strong> grants and scholarships for a current employee as well as an employee or retiree’s children, unemployed individuals, business owners</li> 
        <li><strong>Association membership:</strong> grants and scholarships for members and/or their children and spouses</li> 
        <li><strong>Personal characteristics:</strong> grants for left-handed people, vegetarians, online students, etc.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p> 2. Match yourself to the eligibility requirements. Review all of the details and make sure you fit the grant profile. Do you have the required grade point average? Do you fit within the income requirements? Does your school participate in this particular grant program? Do not waste your time applying for grants unless the minimum standards are met. </p> 
       <p> 3. At the same time, do not limit yourself unnecessarily. By widening your grant search, you may find lucrative grants that are indirectly connected to your selected field of study. Applicants may also gain significant advantages by attending a college in a nearby state. Obscure grants that “no one” has ever heard of can work to your advantage; by applying, you will face less competition. Remember to search for synonyms. For example, English majors could search for grants related to English, writing, editing, publishing, poetry, authors, novels, essays, and other relevant topics.</p> 
       <p> 4. Apply early. Grants funds are generally limited, so they are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Applying early for project-based grant funds may demonstrate enthusiasm about the subject and, in turn, increase the odds of earning the grant. Are grant applications due a year before college attendance is scheduled to start? Are recipients expected to start their degrees within six months of earning an award?</p> 
       <p> 5. Apply for need-based, merit-based, talent-based, and project-based grants, if applicable. Submit the FAFSA, but do not overlook other local and national grant sources. Apply to as many funding sources as possible.</p> 
       <p> 6. Provide all requested information. Keep in mind that, while many grant applications can be completed online, some require paper applications, transcripts, letters of recommendation, proof of membership in a particular tribe, group, or association, and other documents. A few incomplete grant applications are returned for corrections and additional details, but most are rejected altogether. In either situation, the grant application is delayed and funding opportunities are decreased.</p> 
       <p> 7. Have a clear purpose for the money. For project-based grants, presenting clear problem statements, objectives, methods, and evaluation guidelines is critical. Need-based grants may have a more general purpose, such as “pay for textbooks and course fees.” In addition, be aware of what a grant can and cannot be used for. Do not plan on purchasing that new iPod if a grant only pays for tuition. </p> 
       <p> 8. Write essays and documents in formal language with proper spelling and grammar that adheres to the grant guidelines. Avoid jargon and slang. Be concise, specific, and descriptive. If handwritten documents are a requirement, use black ink and print legibly. Otherwise, submit typewritten copy. Focus your statements on the grant agency’s priorities and how you can benefit them in those areas. If requested, discuss your personal story and the impact that a student grant would have on your future.</p> 
       <p> 9. Stay organized. Maintain a record of each grant’s requirements, deadlines, timeframes, award amount, and the documentation submitted. Make copies of all originals before submitting them online or mailing them. Keeping all of this information is helpful for making follow-up calls and for knowing how much the proceeds of one grant might reduce the funding for another grant.</p> 
       <p> 10. Get a second opinion. Review all grant applications before submitting them. Then ask a trusted family member, friend, or advisor to look them over again. Accept constructive criticism instead of becoming defensive. Make edits and ask for more feedback. Important, competitive, and/or high-dollar-value student grants may benefit from up to seven reviews before the final submission.</p> 
       <h3>Combining Student Grants With Scholarships and Loans</h3> 
       <p> Student grants can typically be integrated with scholarships, loans, workstudy funds, and other types of financial aid to offset the expense of going to college. In most cases, the total amount of funding cannot exceed the cost of attendance with tuition, room, board, textbooks, and fees. Virtually all colleges and universities demand to be notified if students receive financial aid from external programs. </p> 
       <p> Students must keep in mind that some grant administrators ask that all other forms of non-loan aid be exhausted before their grants are applied. Most grant funds are sent directly to the school, but some money may be handed to students with the intention that they use it for college-related expenses. Grant recipients must understand when the free money will be disbursed, in case that date passes the tuition deadline.</p> 
       <h3>Taxable Grants</h3> 
       <p> Grants that cover tuition, fees, textbooks, supplies, and equipment are generally tax-free for degree-seeking students. The Internal Revenue Service considers grants and scholarships given to students who are not seeking a degree as income. At the same time, any portion of a student grant that covers room and board, living expenses, research, or travel is also typically counted as income and may be taxable. Students must report taxable income on their federal income tax returns, whether or not they receive an official end-of-year statement asking them to do so.</p>

             <p>I am a 56 year old woman who has worked as an RN for 21 years. I have extensive experience as a psychiatric nursing and am preparing to begin an on-line program to obtain my masters in Mental Health Counseling. I own my own condo and am currently working part-time to allow time to concentrate on my future studies, but will need some financial support to attain a mid-term career change. I hope to secure a grant to help me achieving my goal.</p>

              <p>I just need help. It is extremely late in the game and I am aware of this. I start Snead State Community College in the fall as well as a job at a local hospital as a PCA. I filed my FAFSA but it doesn’t cover it all. I come from a very stressful home. The power gets cut off all the time, my vehicle may get repoed, and I have no money saved up because I have never been employed. I was very involved in school, so I did not have the schedule a part time job was looking for. School was my “get away”. No one knew what I ever went through at home. That is why I was involved. I still need to pay for all of my books and atleast 200 out of pocket that FAFSA did not cover. I am trying to hold it together, but it’s getting difficult because I just need some way to pay this. I have always kept great grades and my studies mean alot to me. My pre-nursing classes plus my new job will consume all of my time, which I am alright with. It would be less stressful if I did not have to worry about paying for my school so much. I will have classes from about seven in the morning to one in the aftertoon. Three at the latest for this first semester. I was told that I would work from either three in the afternoon to eleven at night, eleven at night to seven in the morning, or some twelve hour shifts from seven in the evening to seven in the morning. Things will be very busy with work and school, but I can do this. I just need a hand finacialy.</p>

               <p>What comes to mind is your local Elks, Rotary, Kwanis, or YMCA. I would just write a letter and go see them in person and ask. For you and your background I bet the Rotary especially would be helpful.</p>

             <p>I am a college graduate,now fully disabebed, I have comoleted the only true life story of EDGAR ray Killen,the x-leader of the 1960’s KuKluxKlan. He wrote me 100 pages of truth,apologies and the onloy confession to his crimes. He is 87 years old serving life in Miss. state prison. I aso have 3 completed true stories of my conversionto Christianity all books written to help youth restart life by using me as an example. Lastly, I have a 20 year collection of Christian Art that I drew. All I need is a typest,editor,and publisher financing.My book was front page covered by The Clarion Ledger Newspapre of Jackson, Mississippi, by Pulitizer prize nominee Jerry Mitchell. I do not want money for myself, but do want to help young eople and minorities. Please call me at (228)207-3002 or 228-392-2586 (parents) for any details. I believe in miracles and hope you are the person God will touch and make this possible. Please hurry, I just had cancer stomach tumor removal and may not have but two more years left. I have references, but I feel that God will lead us togeather. I know this sounds so basically amateur but my faith has no bounds and I am a mustard seed for our Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you for taking time to read and pray over this. May you and your be blessed. Larry, in His service. This is my first attempt on a computer, etc.,</p>

             <p>I am an 18 year old High School graduate. I have a passion for music and need funding to enroll in a Audio Engineering apprenticeship program. My dad suffered a heart attack last year and is unable to work and my mom is the sole family provider. Do you know where there are scholarships or grants available? The total cost of the tuition is $8,000. Thank You</p>

             <p>I am a 28 year old white american male. I would really like someone to point me to similar help that I can’t seem to get that others have readily available. I have been searching scholarships and grants and because I’m not African American, foreign, female, or some other biast discrimination I have to pay out the rear end for my education. I am a full time employee for a company with a wife and 3 children to take care of, a house that is constantly needing repair, two 10 year old vehicles with a lot of miles, and oh yea my oldest is Type 1 diabetic so I have to pay for expensive doctors apointments every month and expensive insulins every few weeks to a month. So please before you tell me that you are entitled to all the fre money and government help you do what I do and still push your education foward. I would just like to know why you have to be some sort of minority to have any help in our country. Why can’t any hard working individuals just be entitled to all these d scholarships and grants out there?</p>

              <p>Man I know exactly how you feel I was in a near fatal accident in august of 2010 and I am now unable to work and I am trying to pay bills support a family and pay for fuel to go back and forth to doctors surgeons and physical therapy on $400 a month as well as go to college and because I am not an african american or some mexican or foreigner who doesn’t even pt taxes I am having problems getting any help with the cost of schooling if I was a foreigner or minority or someone who didn’t have to pay taxes they would be lineing up to give me grants or scholarships!!! This country is very unfair to its tax paying citizens who work and try to do right. I sure would appreciate any information on any organization who would help some one like me or any other people who are not minorities!!! Thank you</p>

               <p>Really does seem like a scam. U.S. sponsored schools have their own scholarship programs.</p>

             <p>My 8 year old son has been diagnosed with learning disabilities and ADHD. I have found a school that has a great reputation for helping elementary school kids with these conditions. The problem is the tuition is over half of what I make a year I. IO am in great need of a grant. I have no idea of how to locate help although I know help is available.</p>

              <p>I am currently attending an on-line graduate program, and is very expensive: I have a subsidized/unsubsidized student loan. I am a veteran, discharged under honorable condition. I am interested in applying for a federal grant or any grant available to assist me in my education. In November of 2011, i started the Masters in Health care Administration. I am currently employed at the VA-Veteran Affairs Medcial Center in West Los Angeles. Please provide with all necessary information. Thank you in advance.</p>

             <p>Hello,<br> My name is Victoria. I am attending a nursing school that is 31k. I am searching for grants that are for women (25 or older), women adopted, women from india, and any other time of grants that would help my huge amount of debt for school. I am new at searching for grants; however, I am willing to apply for any grants that would help!</p>

             <p>I am a 45 years old mother of two children, ages 15 and 10. My husband and I recently divorced and are in the process of filing for a divorce. I resigned from my job as an assistant teacher 2 years ago because of rheumatiod arthritis and an herniated disc in my back. I recently started seeing a doctor that has really helped me stay on top of my health issues and I am doing so much better. THANK GOD! As I previously stated I worked as an assistant teacher. I did this for a total of 15 years. I also taught preschool for 5 years. I have always had a passion to work with children as well as a desire to obtain a degree in teaching. I enrolled in a local community college several time to get an education in teaching and each time I had to drop out. I always had issues to arise that would cause me to quit working on my lifelong dream. These issues consist of things like, transportation, children’s health, and needing to work full time. In 2008, I enrolled in an online school. I had to withdraw from it several times because of financial and health reasons. I recently re enrolled and I am determined to accomplish it this time. The problem is the only income that comes into my home is $250.00 a month that my daughter gets for child support. My kids and I are really struggling, but they really want me to finish school. The internet I have is the issue. It is dial-up and it is really slow. I have always used dial-up but the online school has upgraded its website and its hard for me to keep up. I truly desire a high speed internet, it would make things so much easier. This is something I really can’t afford, I am praying that I will be able to afford to keep the dial-up and phone service.<br> I don’t know if anyone can or will help me, but I was led to this website and I believe that God will give me a miracle. Even if I don’t get financial assistance than I know I will have more people praying for me and that in itself is a blessing.</p>

             <p>I am 23 years old and am going to college in January. I have done community college but it has been a struggle due to my parents’ financial issues and I have been diagnosed as schizophrenic and have had cerebral palsy since age 2. I am becoming more stable as far as the mental part goes. I am high functioning. I just hate how some people think that people with mental illnesses and others alike can’t receive a proper education because of lack of ability. Because of the tropical storm that hit my state last August we have had lots of damage due to flooding. My younger brother is going to college next September and we need all the help we can get at this point. My CP is very mild but still inhibits me to a degree.</p>

             <p>I am a 23 african american female who is also a 7 year cancer survivor. I am a US citizen and am really struggling financially. I am blessed enough to have a mom who loves and supports me in every possible way. However, she does not earn nearly enough to put me through college, but apparently makes too much for me to receive any financial aid- according to the government. I am an honors student with a 4.0 GPA and am very passionate about receiving a college education. I have tried tirelessly to pay for my own classes semester by semester. I have completed maybe a year and a half trying to do this on my own. Unfortunately, I am no longer able to come up with the money to pay for any more classes and have had to drop out of school, which breaks my heart. I feel that with the grades, drive and desire that I have to finish school and really make something of myself, there must be someone out there who has been through what I am going through and has the means to help me. As a 16 year old in high school, I was diagnosed with a rare form of breast cancer. I stood up to it and battled it like a soldier. Now here I stand, at 23 years of age, facing yet another battle, to be the second person in my family to go to college (my mom being the first) and come out with a degree. It suddenly occurred to me that this should be no where near as difficult a battle as fighting breast cancer at the age of 16. There must be an organization out there able and willing to put a 23 year old breast cancer survivor with a 4.0 GPA through college. PLEASE HELP!!!</p>

             <p>I am 18 years old and I am planning on attending either Bradford School in Pittsburgh, Pa or Gaston College in Dallas, Nc. I am unemployed and I have no money. My pasrents said if I get accepted to Bradford they will help pay for my schooling, but if I don’t get accepted and get accepted to Gaston college they won’t give any money for me to go to school. What do I do? I need to know if I go to Gaston how I ask for federal grants by myself and loans? This is all new to me and I need help!</p>

             <p>I am a 19 year old senior who is heavily involved with church. I have been accepted to New England School of Communications, which is 20,000 a year. I will have to basically do all four years in loans… I really don’t want to graduate with 80,000 in debt if not more… I really need help being directed to any source websites that could possibly help me…. I am a white average male….so I am quite limited with the scholarships… I am heavily involved with church and within the community….so anything helps… =) If you can help me at all or know any websites at all…my email is, <a href="mailto:Jack-Daily@hotmail.com">Jack-Daily@hotmail.com</a>! </p>

             <p>We are divorced parents and our child begins University this coming September (possibly UConn). Mom became unemployed last February and I (Dad) became unenployed this past November.<br> Currently both parents are unemployed with myself still collecting unemployment benefits (Mom’s has depleted unemployment benefits). Are there any Grants specific to this situation that is not Pell or thru FAFSA?</p>

             <p>I am legally blind and in my 50’s. I pursued a degree in Business graduating in March 2010, earning an MBA in Business Administration and Operations Managment while maintaining a 4.0 GPA. I have repeatedly attempted to return to work, however to no avail. </p> 
             <p>I also have acquired 45 credit hours toward a Masters in Education Managment, and would like to return to school to attain not only the Masters in Education but pursue doctorial studies with a DBA or PHD in Industrial Psychology, that will focus on disparte actions againts older women in America workforce when qualified for suitable employment opportunties.<br> I currently receive SSDI of less than $1,000 per month and have current student loan obligations, not in default. I will need assistance as this problem is major not only in the United States but accross the global economy. </p> 
             <p>Please advice on how older women may acquire grants to complete academic studies in America through simplified steps without having to pay astronomical fees to prepare grant request.</p>

             <p>My name is Crystal, 18, and I just need some help in finding a grant or scholarship. As a former homeless teen I was sexually, mentally, emotionally, and physically abused. As the oldest child of 5 in a Hispanic household I was told I would be nothing more than the duplicate of my drug-addicted mother, I am the first female in my family to graduated high school let alone, with no children. Though my life has not been easy I still graduated high school early and am currently looking for help in furthering my education. I am currently enrolled in Carrington College and attend as a full-time student. I would greatly appreciate any help.</p>

             <p>Does any grant exist that would help a 50+ mom of two who is married to an unsupportive “pay for it yourself” type? I have worked in computer graphics but now run our home and do occasional freelance artwork. I never made it to college in the first go round but got super lucky with jobs decades ago. I’d like to get some form of degree… So sick of feeling stupid and regretful.</p>

             <p>I am interested in finding out my chances for a grant as a recovering addict. I have been clean off drugs for 2 1/2 years. I am currently enrolled at University of Phoenix with 63 credits towards my Bachelor’s Degree majoring in Psychology. I plan if I find the funds with grants to Master in Counseling and work with the addict. My target is outreach to find the forgotten, abandoned, and rejected of society which many are currently addicted to alcohol or drugs. If anyone, anywhere can help me continue with this education to give something back to society, I need your help.</p>

             <p>I am 33 yr old mom of 5 kids. When I was 15 I had to quit school and take care of my dad who was ill. 2 yrs ago I got my GED. Now I am enrolling in school to get my occupational associates in medical assisting degree. I can get some pell grant funding but would leave me with a balance of 20,000.00 in student loans. With 5 kids I need all the money i can get to pay my bills so if I have loan payments it would have to come out of my bill money each month. My mom died when I was 15 and she was a nurse and I looked up to her for taking care of people who were sick. And my dad never could read or write, and he passed away 5 yrs ago. I want this not just for me but also to make them proud and show to myself and to my family that i can make a difference in this world even if it is only one person at a time. God bless.</p>

             <p>I am the mother of ten children. Irecently went to a college that didn’t give me the skills needed to engage in a full time job. I found out that I have breast cancer, after the loss of our 37 year old son to brain cancer in august of 2011. I currently have two associates degrees. one in criminal justice, the other as a medical assistant. I would dearly love to be a nurse. I love helping others. I don’t know, without some help how i could ever realize my dream and help our family. Is there anyone who can assist me? Thank you so much.</p>

             <p>I’m a female 21 from Jacksonville Fl, also, I’m left handed and have a CGPA of 3.76. I’m persuing an A.S. with hopes to advance to receive a B.S. in Health Science. I have taken a loan out for the first 3 semesters, however, after this semester my loan is up. I just recently became unemployed, and I’m trying to figure out any possible way I could pay for the rest of my education. I really don’t want to take another loan out, but if I have to I will. It would be nice to not be stressed over the matter. Any information would be extremely appreciated!</p>

             <p>I just read a lot of the information related to all the programs available. I do not even know how to start. I am a US citizen and live in san Pr. Latin descendant from Colombia, SA. I have three children; third grade, seventh and eleventh grade. I am going through a very harsh economical distress and paying for the private school is becoming impossible. Public school in Pr is not an option, there is no such concept like in the states. I want to go back to college myself to be able to become a better provider for my kids. I only did two years in college and have been taking care of my kids since. I work free lance being a jewelry rep. I need to find a way to get help to pay for my kids schools and upcoming college for my eleventh grader son. Also for me.. If there is an institution that helps narrow it down to get the help I need, please let me know. I have little time left to find a way to keep my children in the school they go to. Thank you and i really appreciate your help, I know you must get hundrends of stories and letters all related to the same subject.. so thank you.</p>

             <p>A warm wellcome to all global citizens. Life is full of diverse challenges and education is the key to open all closed doors to our future. To all those that can provide grants – blessed is the hand that gives. The bible says, I was hungry and you gave me food where at this hour is education. I am 44 yrs a citizen of eSwatini and desperately willing to farther my studies for a degree in Project Management offered at Atlantic International University in the USA. I need financial aid or grant to help me to realise my dream, at the moment I am having a diploma which is a minimum effort. Pls. find me at (www.dlaminimpu.com) (dlaminimpu@gov.sz) (box 4463 Mbabane)</p>

             <p>Ok I am a single woman with four children. I live in Tennessee. I have my associates degree in psychology, and I only have 10 classes left before gaining my bachelor’s degree in psychology as well. My issue is I have ran out of fin aid and about to have to withdrawl from school because I cannot afford to pay out of pocket anymore for my tuition. Can someone help me with some organizations, scholarships, or grants I may apply for to stay in school and complete my dream? I am not a part of the military, or anything else. Just a normal person trying to make it! Please help!</p>

             <p>I’m a 25 year old student who would really need a lot help with my studies. My family are running with some financial crisis, and I only have one job which does pay a lot. My mother is sick and cannot work as much as before, therefore, I have to watch for her and my family. My dad doesn’t work as much as before due for no jobs avaliable. I was in school for couple of years, but since my mother ended up getting ill, I could not finish my studies. My GPA is 2.79 which low due for my last semester not passing my other classes during the moment My mother got sick.</p>

             <p>I am a Junior in college and i transfered from a private school where i was undecided so not all my credits got accepted. i am now a biology major but very stressed out because i want to graduate. My dream is to go back to Africa to help children who are in need, therefore, i want to go into international public health with the biology major. I live with some relates here but my parents are in Africa. I wish i could get some money to take courses over the summer so when i come back in the fall i would not be taking too many courses to be stressed out like this. I do not have a job which i have been looking for one since but there is none. I am requesting if there is any one out there who can help me with a grant to take courses over the summer. Thank you.</p>

             <p>Dear sir,<br> I`m Abdullah Al-Masud, Masters in Accounting from National university in Bangladesh Now I have planned to pursue my study for masters and then for PhD. Any University from any country is my first choice to pursue my study. I am greatly interested by the diversified specializations in Accounting as well as by the quality education available in the universities. My field of interest are MBA,Management,Finance,Marketing,Accounting. Since my father had died before I was five year old , So my mother could not afford me the fees for GRE and TOEFL exam and then to pursue further thus I need financial aid in the form of assistantships, fellowships or scholarship.<br> I am looking forward to receive your reply.<br> Again, thank you for your time and this wonderful opportunity.<br> Abdullah Al-Masud</p>

             <p>I am a 22 year-old, blind female, looking to study an undergraduate degree in Scotland. I have been exploring many different avenues of financial aid, but have not yet come across any for Americans seeking education elsewhere. Are there any specific types of grants that are geared towards helping International studies outside the USA?</p>

             <p>I have searched for grants or scholarships for a month now online and have not found any under state, or federal to help me. I will be going to college to get a degree in Forensic’<br> Science with a lot of Chemistry and Calculus on a bachelor degree in Science at a university close to home, but need more help than f.a.s.f.a. can do for me. I have a g.p.a. of 3.94 weighted , great letters of recommendations and will have a heavy load to complete this in four years. I am in honors classes, white and have no money for college. Have A.P. English college credit and taking a.p. music theory. Graduate in May of 2012 and looks like their would be a scholarship out there some place to help finish up the first year of college. Thanks</p>

             <p>I am currently a student ( student number 23604743 ) monash university of south Africa doing a four years program in the school of information technology. since July last year i have done all the basic studies related to I.T e.g mathematics, English, word processing, excel, access, database, understanding university learning e.t.c . i am requesting for a grant that best suits my Catergory to continue my studies since i am now left with 3 years from July 2012. any well wisher is welcome to furnish me with details that i need to know. for the past one year in the university, i have learnt to be a critical thinker and a reader, i have also developed academic literacy which i think there is a need to continue if someone funds my school. The degree which i will obtain will benefit the community and the funders in turn. my email is: <a href="mailto:ckabali2010@yahoo.com">ckabali2010@yahoo.com</a> humbly awaiting response.</p>

             <p>Hello Everyone, I’m a 56 year old mother, grandmother and certified nurses aide. My husband is a disabled army veteran….He worked 40 years as a painter/wallpaper contractor. It’s time for him to retire and for me to support him. My dream has always been to be a nurse. At my age being an aide is getting too much for this body. I finally passed the TEAS test and was enrolled in a private college. I need financial help since I won’t be able to work during my 15 month program. I’m very motivated and love the nursing field. Can someone give me some info. on where to go to apply for scholarships or grants. Thanks for your help</p>

             <p>Hi,<br> I would like to be able to continue my education,I am going into my junior year at meredith College in Raleigh,NC and My problem is my parents do not have the funds.They have already borrowed almost 40,000.00 for the last two years and my dads work is real slow,(construction)my mom cleans houses a few days a week,and now we have three of my nephews living with us since Nov. of last year and it has really taken a toll on my parents,they are really having a hard time and I’m worried if I don’t get help I will not be able to finish college.So if there is a chance you all could help,PLEASE do so,because I really want to finish and get a good job so that I can make a difference in the lives of others.Also would love to be able to help my parents out.<br> Thank You Very Much</p>

             <p>I attend Johnson C Smith university in Charlotte NC. I am entering my sophomore year of college and came up short of money from my financial aid. I have tried to get scholarships for this up coming year but came up short. I am still looking for money out there that i can receive. I tried students loans but it seems like everyplace wants me to have a cosign. Neither of my family would cosign for me to get the loans i need.</p>

             <p>I am 22 years old and plan on attending Full Sail University within the next couple of months for an associates degree in Audio Engineering. Music is something that I am very passionate about, &amp; I really, really want to attend, but am having serious financial hardships and don’t want to take out a loan, unless I necessarily have to. So if anyone knows of any scholarships and grants that I can apply for, feel free to let me know. Thank you very much!!</p>

             <p>Am a Ugandan aged 35 years. I finished an ordinary diploma in building and civil engineering in 2001. I also finished a higher diploma in building and Civil engineering June2012. I have a desire to finish up with a degree in Civil engineering starting August in the coming academic year 2013/2014 from one of the accredited Universities in Uganda. With a number of dependants am taking care off to pay their fees coupled with no stable work, my dreams of getting a masters in Structural Engineering seem to be green. I request any good samaritan to help me achieve this dream.<br> Email: <a href="mailto:ogulojames@yahoo.com">ogulojames@yahoo.com</a><br> mobile: +256-772-824247.<br> God bless.</p>

             <p>Am a student of one of the Ugandan Universities doing social Works and administration . I finished a certificate level and now doing a diploma in the same course. Through great toil and moil , I managed to finish the two semisters but am getting stuck with the two remaining semesters costing each $800. At moment am at home helpless, studies have started but no hope of getting the required money. I request for assistance to help me finish the course.My heart lies in helping the poor communities.</p>

             <p>Hello<br> I will graduate on June 8, 2013 from a four-year institution. My aim is to return to school for a master’s in psychology. At this time, I do not have the funds to pay the high cost of tuition. I am already $40,000 (forty-thousand dollars) dollars in debt. I am trying to find a part-time job to start paying some of the bill. I need help to continue my education. I don’t have a family member who is in a position to help me pay for my master’s. Please help. Any amount of money will be appreciated. I may be contacted at my grandmother’s Email. After graduation, I will no longer be able to use my school’s Email.<br> Thank you for your kindness,<br> Asia</p>

             <p>I am 23 years old and mentally disabled. Fortunately, I have been accepted into a two year non degreed program that starts Fall 2014. I am very excited. I am seeking your assistance in the form of a scholarship or grant so that I can further my post secondary education. I can not get financial aid due to the program being non-degreed. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you. </p>

             <p>Hi,</p> 
             <p>I am 23 years old going to UAB as a Theatre major. I’ve recently decided to join the Military because I need stability in my life and I feel as if this would be an opportunity to do just that. I have no financial support from either one of my parents and never really had guidance as far as my finances goes. With that being said, I am in debt, and I can’t blame anyone but myself for this issue but I am doing the things now to correct them.<br> I thought that if I joined the Military, other than them helping pay for my student loans and them giving me financial stability, this would be the perfect opportunity to start paying off said debt. I just recently found out that the Military looks at that debt as you not being stable (which is true and the number reason I decided to join), I can’t join without paying this debt off or at least having something in writing stating that I’m making payments. The only issue is, I’m barely living pay check to pay check. I’m barely making enough to survive. I don’t work very much because school takes up so much time so I had to cut my hours at work. Which is why I’m coming to you today in hopes that you would donate not to my student loans but my other debt<br> (medical bills and credit cards which all adds up to about $8,500), that way I can join and start to finally get my life on track!<br> I appreciate you and I look forward to hearing from you soon<br> If you’re willing to help. I’m willing to accept! No donation is too small.</p>

             <p>Hello,</p> 
             <p>question. I have a child attending a FL University. Turned in all required documents. The University Financial Aid office said I had to send them my W2 or they would suspend the Fed Grant in 2 days,<br> 1. can they legally demand a parent’s W2 in the first place?<br> 2. They even demanded it for the wrong academic year, not the 2013-14 school year and said my pertinent finacial information did not match. They were looking at the wrong year. </p> 
             <p>You can email me back. Thank you.</p>

             <p>I will be the first in my family to attend an university and I am desperate for money to continue my studies. Ever since I was a little girl I pictured myself going to a big university to get a degree in Psychology to counsel abused children. I always pictured myself helping others and doing good for others and I don’t want money to be a factor. I always thought that I would have college paid for and now I’m afraid my dreams won’t come true because I don’t have enough money for college. I want to be able to make my family proud and do something that could benefit other as well. I’m not asking for much but for someone to invest their time and efforts to believe in me, and hopefully help me continue my journey for success. I would surely appreciate the help if you could email me: <a href="mailto:dejadavidson15@outlook.com">dejadavidson15@outlook.com</a>. God Bless</p>

             <p>Hi, I owe a college about $2,000 because I did not know that I would not be able to loan in the summer. I am a single mom and would love to finish my semester so that I can move on and graduate. Where can I apply for grants? Thank you so much for your help!</p>

             <p>I am in recovery from alcohol and drug addiction. I have given a lot of thought to going to school for something in the medical field or to be a drug and alcohol abuse counselor. However, as a parent and as a full time employee, it’s hard to get the funds, as well as the time, to go back to school.</p>

             <p>Hi, Currently i’m a btech 3rd year student. I’ve already taken an education loan and later i realised the fact that the money they have sanctioned is not sufficient to continue my study. I’ve to pay my tution fee of Rs 35,000 for the final year. I would be so grateful to those who are ready to help me.<br> Thanks.</p>
