               A master’s degree is the first level of graduate study, typically requiring one to two years of full-time study. To pursue a master’s, you’ll need an undergraduate (bachelor’s) degree. Many degrees are specialized to prepare you to enter the job market as a highly qualified applicant or work as an educator in your field.

              <dd>
                A doctoral degree is the highest achievable graduate degree, preparing students to work in the upper echelons of their field as either practitioners or educators. Many doctoral candidates complete a dissertation, thesis or project based off original research, defending their work in front of a committee of experts. Others take rigorous coursework that prepares them for professional practice and licensure.

               A graduate certificate is approximately equivalent to a bachelor’s or master’s degree, but with a more limited scope. Most can be achieved in a year or less, and many confer professional benefits such as licensure. Learn more about

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The master's in public policy (MPP) program teaches students to practice public policy in the real world through developing skills such as problem identification, analysis of solutions, writing, advocacy and persuasion. Our faculty members, who have practical policy experience, include a former three-term governor of Colorado, a former federal fraud prosecutor and senior manager for a federal regulatory agency and the chief budget officer for Colorado. Students will learn alongside renowned policy experts and policy makers both in traditional classroom settings and in intensive seminars. Featured speakers will come from top think tanks and policy-making bodies from Denver and beyond.</p> 
             <p>Students from all undergraduate programs and backgrounds are welcome, as there are no prerequisites for MPP courses. In the final year of their studies, students apply their skills to the real world by completing a capstone project analyzing a specific policy and potential solutions. Alumni hold positions locally, nationally and internationally, working for government, nonprofit organizations and private businesses, leveraging the network of one of the nation's leading schools for international studies. If you're ready to reward and challenge yourself, we invite you to join our exceptional body of students.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>In today's increasingly globalized society, the world needs individuals who can navigate the complexities of communication across cultural and geographic borders. Our joint master's degree combines courses from the prestigious Josef Korbel School of International Studies and the Department of Media, Film and Journalism Studies to prepare individuals to understand and facilitate all modes of communication and media in both local and global contexts, bridging the gap between international and intercultural differences. Students who pursue the MA can develop competencies in cross-cultural communication while gaining skills in strategic communication, ethical journalism and international diplomacy.</p> 
             <p>Students may find meaningful work in industries that recognize the value of multicultural communication or that operate on a global scale, such as international NGOs. Graduates of our program have careers in fields such as strategic communication, public relations, nonprofit management, government diplomacy, international higher education and conflict resolution. Because of their cross-cultural understanding, flexible problem-solving and excellent writing ability, students tend to become valuable contributors in any role. This program is also a partner of the Paul D. Coverdell Fellows Program, which provides scholarship opportunities for returned Peace Corps volunteers.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The Master of Arts in musicology prepares musicians for careers as scholars and pedagogues in the field of musicology through advanced levels of coursework, teaching assistantships and assessment. Designed to foster critical thinkers and writers, the MA in musicology offers a wide range of courses in classical and vernacular Western and non-Western music. Courses focus on the study of music in its historical, analytical and cultural contexts. Master's theses may focus on topics drawn from a variety of subdisciplines, including historical musicology, popular music studies, jazz history and ethnomusicology. The thesis is written under the supervision of a faculty mentor.</p> 
             <p>This program is designed to develop advanced musical, scholarly and intellectual skills. Master's candidates also may pursue a dual degree with any of the Master of Music concentrations. Training to be a music scholar challenges students to learn discipline, collaboration and creative thinking while developing emotional intelligence. These skills and abilities prepare students for successful careers not only in musicology, but also a variety of other fields within and beyond music.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The University of Denver's MA in Philosophy is designed for two kinds of students: those planning to pursue doctoral work in Philosophy, and those seeking to pursue an individualized, interdisciplinary course of study. With the option to specialize in critical theory, students may apply for a fellowship to fund summer study at The School of Criticism and Theory at Cornell University, where they may further critique government systems and power structures. The program is possible through the flexible dual-degree program that allows students to earn master's degrees in two complementary disciplines, based on their interests and career goals.</p> 
             <p>Students who study Philosophy at the graduate level develop skills that make them invaluable to employers in any industry-they may learn to formulate and defend advanced positions, listen critically, write clearly, and analyze complex chains of cause and effect. With a deep understanding of contemporary philosophy and the major trends in the history of Western philosophy, students may choose to continue their education as academics or build careers in roles such as legal affairs, government, healthcare or business.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The University of Denver and the Iliff School of Theology's joint doctoral program in the study of religion prepares students for independent research and teaching in religious and theological studies. It's structured to provide a rigorous, individualized program of study and research for students planning careers in higher education or as public intellectuals. The program offers six areas of specialization, enabling students to work at the intersection of different disciplines:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>Bible, ancient Judaism, early Christianity</li>
              <li>Religion, art and media</li>
              <li>Religion, race and ethnicity</li>
              <li>Religion and its publics (U.S. and international)</li>
              <li>Theories of religion</li>
              <li>Religion and human experience</li>
             </ul>
             <p></p> 
             <p>Another distinctive aspect of the program is that it draws on the strengths of faculty members throughout the University, as well as faculty at the <a href="http://www.iliff.edu/" target="_blank">Iliff School of Theology</a>. This inter-institutional collaboration enables features such as interdisciplinary, team-taught research seminars, as well as special lectures and events. Students can pursue complementary certificate programs in pedagogy, religion and international studies, and Latinx studies. With the opportunity to develop skills and abilities across disciplines, many graduates find positions as faculty members or administrators in higher education, while others choose careers within religious organizations, institutes, counseling centers and government agencies.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The University of Denver's PhD in English and literary arts with a concentration in literary studies exposes students to a wide range of literature and literary theory as they prepare to teach and research at the university level. Flexible course schedules allow students to design their degree based on their areas of interest. Students are encouraged to draw connections across genres, relate theory to practice and work creatively on research projects. Beyond graduate seminars, students may enroll in small-group tutorials and seminars specifically designed to enhance their teaching skills and provide professional development opportunities.</p> 
             <p>In this doctoral program, students have the opportunity to teach various courses in literature and writing, helping to develop their skills as educators. Students often customize their professional development by organizing their own reading series, attending conferences and collaborating with faculty to publish original research. They're frequently invited to participate in experiences such as faculty hiring and other committee assignments, which can prepare them to navigate careers in academia. The curiosity, work ethic and analytical skills students work to cultivate throughout their studies can also help them establish successful careers in non-academic roles that value communication and creative problem solving.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>Social work is a growing career path where professionals work toward social justice, advocate for marginalized groups and make a positive difference in the world. In the Master of Social Work (MSW) program at the Graduate School of Social Work (GSSW), students apply social work theories and research through classroom experiences, community projects and field internships. GSSW students are diverse change makers who work toward equity, inform policy and serve humanity during their educational journey and throughout their professional careers. Classroom instruction and field education prepare students for a fulfilling career as they work with individuals, families, communities and organizations.</p> 
             <p>Our curriculum allows students to specialize in one of 10 concentration areas that focus on practice from youth to older adults in clinical, community and international settings. Students develop relationships with faculty and conduct research on global issues like homelessness or trauma in mental health. With more than 600 field internship sites from schools and hospitals to public and private agencies, students choose their internship placement and immediately apply theory in a practice setting. To accommodate diverse learning needs, GSSW has four MSW program locations in Denver, Glenwood Springs, Durango and MSW@Denver (<a href="https://onlinemsw.du.edu/" target="_blank">online</a>).</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The Master of Music in performance prepares musicians for careers as performers on each student's particular instrument of expertise. This is accomplished through extensive performance opportunities and a studio appointment with a faculty member in combination with advanced levels of coursework and assessment. The MM in performance can be pursued with a classical emphasis or a jazz emphasis. The classical emphasis provides professional training in the performance of Western art music. The jazz emphasis expands the student's creativity while providing the experience and knowledge necessary to build a career in performing, composition, arranging and recording jazz and contemporary music.</p> 
             <p>This program is designed to develop advanced musical and intellectual skills. In addition to the technical and artistic skills students may develop through the program, they'll have ample opportunity to engage deeply and intuitively in collaborative, creative work. This experience encourages them to further develop their emotional intelligence, preparing them for careers in music and other fields.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The University of Denver's Master of Arts in chemistry aims to instill students with the ability to learn independently and to define and help solve new problems. Chemists in our graduate programs work to contribute to the fundamental understanding of their discipline and help others understand their contributions and those of their contemporaries. Intended for students already working full time in industry or secondary education, the MA is an advanced degree with an emphasis on coursework as opposed to research, and a research thesis is not required.</p> 
             <p>The goal of this programs is to realize the full development of each student's talents and ensure they can develop skills that will serve them through their lives and careers. The relatively modest population of our graduate program allows us to maintain small class sizes with high levels of interaction between students and faculty, as well as frequent collaboration with other students. That tight-knit nature also helps ensure students are able to get all the support they need, and can tailor their educations to meet their specific needs and wants.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The University of Denver's MA in anthropology focuses on public anthropology: applying the discipline's concepts, methods and insights to issues of contemporary relevance and concern. Students can concentrate in archaeology, cultural anthropology or museum and heritage studies, or design their own course of study combining any of the three. Both classroom and hands-on experiences are offered, with students having the opportunity to participate in archaeological field schools or community-engaged research projects, as well as the chance to work in collections and in the Museum of Anthropology gallery.</p> 
             <p>Students can use their real-world experience to develop professional skills for work in research, teaching, cultural resource management, museums and heritage sites; public heath, community development; environmental conservation, and human rights and social welfare. The University's long-established relationships with museums, Native American community partners, local nonprofit organizations, and government agencies in the Rocky Mountain region and beyond provide students with opportunities for collaborative research, internships and networking. Whether students pursue careers as professional anthropologists, field technicians, museum professionals, national park staff or heritage site educators, they are informed by a cross-cultural and deep time perspective on the human condition.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The Master of Arts in music theory prepares musicians for careers as music scholars and teachers in the field of music theory through advanced coursework, teaching assistantships and assessment. Candidates may study counterpoint, Schenkerian analysis, theory pedagogy, set theory, serialism, contour theory, neo-Riemannian techniques, chaos, new approaches to rhythm and texture, and model composition in the styles of composers from the 12th century to the present. Theorists also benefit from courses offered by the Department of Musicology and Ethnomusicology, a number of which are composer-based. The thesis for this program is written under the close supervision of a faculty mentor.</p> 
             <p>The program is designed to develop advanced musical, scholarly and intellectual skills while challenging students to refine their own abilities in the areas of discipline and creative collaboration. Many who go through the program find that engaging deeply in the study and analysis of music develops emotional intelligence and helps them approach not only music but other pursuits with greater intuition. Master's candidates may also pursue a dual degree with any of the Master of Music concentrations.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The academic study of religion is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing upon a number of perspectives to understand faiths and beliefs. Religious studies builds intercultural competencies while providing a deeper understanding of oneself and the "other." DU's MA in religious studies takes a flexible approach, grounding students in theory while equipping them with practical skills through site visits, service learning, research and study abroad opportunities. Based on their interests and goals, students can customize their educational experience by choosing from one of five areas of specialization and one of four degree-completion options.</p> 
             <p>Graduates offer employers a range of transferable skills, including cross-cultural analytical abilities, flexible problem-solving experience, and strong verbal and written communication skills. Additionally, broad exposure to critical theory, as well as the intersections between religion and politics, tends to make students critical thinkers with a lens on contemporary issues. Many graduates from the MA program go on to attend top-tier doctoral programs in religious studies, while others become valuable contributors in career fields such as business, government, social work or journalism.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The University of Denver's Master of Science in geographic information science (GIS), offered through the Department of Geography and the Environment, is designed for students interested in careers in geotechnology. The program provides in-depth study of geotechnological skills, including cartography, remote sensing, geographic information systems and global positioning systems. Digital solutions and data analysis are increasingly essential in the way we understand geography, cartography and how they relate to human activity. These systems can be used to gain insight into the patterns and trends that define our relationship to our environment.</p> 
             <p>Because the insight students can acquire through geographic information has important ramifications for policy and decision making, there may be a healthy job market for students upon graduation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts demand for graduates with geotechnological skills will grow by 30 percent by 2024. Some of our recent graduates have found work in both private industry and government.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The MA in global finance, trade and economic integration (GFTEI) is a comprehensive program focused on understanding the global economy. Rather than narrow, technical and arcane, this degree is flexible and interdisciplinary, and students are encouraged to be open-minded. Faculty and students explore how capital and trade flows impact nations; the effects of globalization; the relationship among economic, political and social outcomes; and other topics related to economic policy and political economy. Students focus on the topics and areas of the world that matter most to them. Students also take skills-based courses preparing them for their future careers.</p> 
             <p>In the final year of the program, each student prepares a significant capstone research memorandum, which analyzes a policy problem and evaluates potential solutions. This project allows students to apply their skills to a real-world problem of their choosing. Through a required internship, students gain practical experience in private, public, multilateral or nonprofit organizations. The ability to navigate and understand the complexities of global economies makes graduates extremely desirable for careers in international economic policy analysis for public-sector agencies, research analyst positions within NGOs and private-sector careers.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>Our MA in International Development focuses on providing students with relevant skills in and out of the classroom. In class, students examine the theory, policy and politics of development. Outside the classroom, students can apply their knowledge by completing an internship in the U.S. or abroad. The International Development curriculum stresses the importance of sustainable development, human rights, distributive justice and environmental sustainability. Students explore both the micro-level development happening in rural farming communities and the macro-level development occurring within multinational nonprofits.</p> 
             <p>MA students at the Korbel School complete an average of 225 internships annually in 24 countries, with 50 percent in Colorado, 25 percent internationally, and 25 percent in the U.S. outside of Colorado. International Development graduates pursue careers within government, multilateral and bilateral development agencies, non-governmental organizations and the private sector.

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>While many economics programs focus strictly on teaching mainstream theories and quantitative skills, our MA in economics program challenges students to explore both mainstream and alternative theories. We place emphasis on gaining conceptual understandings in addition to the acquisition of quantitative skills. Instead of simply learning how to conduct economic analyses, students are encouraged to critically examine why those analyses have been formulated in specific manners, and to compare and contrast alternative approaches. With applied elective courses in many fields, students can analyze the specific economic and social policy issues that interest them.</p> 
             <p>Student research culminates with a thesis project that requires candidates to connect what they've learned, make analytical applications to economic problems, and articulate their arguments and conclusions using their own voice. The critical analytical skills, ability to think outside the box and preparation to conduct insightful research can enable graduates to enjoy long-term success in the public or private sector. Students may launch careers in governmental agencies, policy research organizations, the business sector or within Denver's thriving startup and renewable energy sectors.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>Our Master of Fine Arts in emergent digital practices is a three-year, technically advanced degree in which students use new technologies to produce creative works. Through access to state-of-art spaces and hands-on opportunities to master diverse digital tools, students push the boundaries of artistic and critical expression. In contrast to the MA, students in the MFA program complete their degrees by creating and publicly showcasing a body of original artwork, preparing for careers as artists.</p> 
             <p>MFA students explore art forms ranging from interactive to visual to sonic, but they tend to focus on using art to promote critical analysis and social change. The technical and creative problem-solving skills emergent digital practices students can develop leave them poised for success in the arts, whether they become makers, critics, historians or curators. This degree also qualifies individuals to teach at a university level. Graduates have established fulfilling careers as open software or hardware designers, installation artists, curators, technology critics, gallery owners and academics.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The University of Denver's MA in emergent digital practices is a two-year degree that examines the intersection of art and technology through a critical lens, addressing the broad cultural phenomenon of emerging technologies. Designers and critical thinkers tend to be attracted to this program, which prepares students to work in spaces beyond what are already defined and familiar. To complete the degree program, students design a digital creation and critically evaluate the evolution of their design and its implementation through writing.</p> 
             <p>Students in the program may choose to explore interdisciplinary ideas and practices, including digital design, game design, data visualization, 3-D animation, sonic environments, modeling and more. The technical and creative problem-solving skills students can develop leave them poised for success in the artistic or entrepreneurial worlds, where the need for forward-thinking analysis fuses with real-world applications. Graduates may establish careers as game designers, open hardware or software creators, art directors or technology critics-any roles where their unique combination of skills and perspective is valued.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>Our Master of Arts in art history is perfect for students who wish to develop a deep understanding of the ways in which art reflects and affects the individuals and societies that produce it. You'll work closely with professors and internationally recognized visiting artists, curators and scholars and take part in scholarly research on your topic of choice. A wealth of class options will allow you the flexibility necessary to find that which moves you, whether that means delving into the connections between art and technology or focusing on a specific cultural sphere or movement.</p> 
             <p>Students with an MA in art history may pursue further graduate studies, and the skills they develop will prepare them for work in such fields as education, curation and publishing. Thanks to our strong partnerships with Denver art and cultural institutions, an optional <a href="https://www.du.edu/ahss/anthropology/programs/graduate/museumstudies.html" target="_blank">concentration in museum studies</a> better prepares students to work in galleries and museums.</p>

             <p>Prepare for your writing to be performed, as you explore the genre of dramatic writing in the professional dramatic writing program. You'll analyze the key elements of powerful drama and write text for performance in person, on film, on radio or in such new media as podcasts. To ensure you have the background knowledge to fully use these skills, you'll have the opportunity to explore the traditions and masterworks of the dramatic form. Because dramatic writing is such a performance-based form, we'll help you discover ways to find and connect with audiences.</p> 
             <p>In addition to developing your skills as a playwright or screenwriter, you'll learn the editing techniques and writing routines and habits that can be utilized in any field where writing is a central component. You can earn your MA in professional creative writing with a concentration in professional dramatic writing entirely online or evenings on campus through the University of Denver's University College. Beyond the coursework dedicated to dramatic writing, you also can choose electives from other creative writing areas, including poetry, fiction and nonfiction writing.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>Nationally recognized for outstanding achievement, our PhD in English and Literary Arts with a concentration in Creative Writing was one of the first programs of its kind in the country and remains among the finest in the U.S. Through the opportunity to combine the in-depth study of literature with creative writing workshops, students can develop skills and interests that help them become more complete writers and teachers. Beyond their specific focus on poetry or fiction, students can take workshops in translation, travel writing, hybrid writing, memoir or creative nonfiction.</p> 
             <p>In this intimate and talented writing community, students hone their writing skills through constant exposure to new ideas and experiences. Thanks to our ongoing lecture series and regular guest workshops, students can interact with internationally known writers and publishers. As they develop their research and creative profiles, they may participate in the editorial management of Denver Quarterly, one of the most distinguished literary journals in the country. Students and graduates of the program have won numerous national and international awards and have gone on to have successful careers as writers, scholars, and teachers.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>Our PhD in Developmental Psychology prepares students for careers in academia or other research positions. We provide training in both theory and research, with cross-area emphases in developmental cognitive neuroscience and developmental psychopathology. With ongoing collaborations with Denver-area organizations (such as the Denver Health Hospital Authority, local Head Starts and Women, Infants and Children), as well as a variety of centers and institutes within the CU system, students receive unique, hands-on opportunities to develop knowledge and skills. Students may also decide to earn a concentration in developmental cognitive neuroscience, gaining additional training in how neural, cognitive and developmental processes interact.</p> 
             <p>Our department and program values a collaborative, integrative approach to psychological science that fosters intellectual curiosity and innovation, invests in people in a supportive, inclusive environment, and serves the public good. Developmental research emphasizes the importance of longitudinal studies of developmental trajectories and employs a variety of methods including biological sampling, behavioral observation and neuroscience tools like fMRI. Students have the opportunity to present research at a variety of conferences, and can receive research and travel funding to support their work. Many students also participate in faculty grant efforts and are encouraged to pursue independent research grants.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The Morgridge College of Education's MA in child, family and school psychology allows you to build the skills and understanding needed to help students of all backgrounds and developmental abilities flourish. The primary goal of the program is to provide knowledge on the various environmental, neurobiological and cultural factors that impact child development. This hands-on program allows you to pursue internships and research opportunities through such DU institutions as the Counseling and Educational Services Clinic, the Ricks Center for Gifted Education and the Fisher Early Learning Center, as well as various community partners.</p> 
             <p>Upon completion of this program, you can pursue licensure as a school psychologist in the state of Colorado. As a full-time student, you can complete the MA program in one year (four quarters). Many students who achieve the MA use it as a springboard into our PhD program. Either way, you'll be able to leave DU prepared to help solve problems and collaborate with diverse students, families, schools and communities. Child, family and school psychology is a rapidly expanding field, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts this profession will grow 20 percent between 2014 and 2024.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>Using a clinical science training model, our clinical psychology PhD program primarily focuses on providing training in clinical child psychology. Accredited by the APA, we provide clinical, research and specialization opportunities, as well as a concentration in cognitive neuroscience. Students receive in-house training through the <a href="http://www.du.edu/ahss/psychology/child-family-clinic/index.html" target="_blank">Center for Child and Family Psychology</a>, the <a href="http://www.du.edu/ahss/psychology/dnrl/clinic/index.html" target="_blank">Developmental Neuropsychology Clinic</a> and apprenticeships. Clinical externships at local medical centers, as well as internships across the country, offer more opportunities for development. We encourage participation in faculty grant efforts and the pursuit of independent research grants, and some students receive research and travel funding to support their work.</p> 
             <p>Our program values an approach that fosters curiosity, innovation, collaboration and inclusiveness, with research that serves the public good. Our faculty specialize in such areas as violence and trauma, romantic relationships, racial and ethnic disparities in mental health service, neuroscience and developmental psychopathology. Students join our faculty in their exploration of the above areas, ADHD, parenting and learning disabilities. Our graduates have pursued careers as college teachers and clinical science researchers. In recent years, 75 percent of them have become licensed psychologists, and many pursue academic and research positions that do not require licensure.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>The Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) program in clinical psychology has been continuously accredited by the American Psychological Association since 1979, and has a strong foundation in the practitioner-scholar model of training. We value the dynamic, active interplay between clinical work and scholarship. Since its inception, the program has provided four key training experiences: academic coursework, in-house clinical work, community-based clinical work and departmental mentorship. We aim to train future psychologists who have interpersonal and scientific skills, a mastery of assessment and intervention and the ability to apply these skills in a wide range of settings with a variety of populations.</p> 
             <p>Starting in the first quarter, students begin clinical practice in our community-based mental health center. Students are also required to be in a community field placement: supervised professional experiences in places like mental health centers, schools, college counseling centers, the justice system, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, private practices and residential treatment homes throughout the Denver metropolitan area. Each student is expected to choose a specialty area in which to increase their depth of knowledge and skills, including forensic psychology, Latino psychology, military psychology and oncology psychology. The program has its own consortium as a choice for pre-doctoral internship.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>Our MA in communication studies broadly explores how communication impacts humanity's understanding of cultures, relationships and communities. Whether examining the intersections of culture and communication, exploring how identity is communicated, or analyzing how humans use language to persuade, students are exposed to diverse perspectives, ideologies and power structures. Students have the opportunity to customize their degree by choosing an area of concentration-from culture and communication, interpersonal and family communication, or rhetoric and communication ethics-and a degree completion method that matches their career goals.</p> 
             <p>Many students from our communication studies MA program find vocations as passionate educators and faculty members, while others may establish careers in government, journalism, marketing, public relations or social work. Most important, the critical thinking, inclusive communication techniques and flexible problem-solving skills students gain through the sustained study of communication can benefit them in any role.</p>

             <h3> About this Program </h3> 
             <p>Our PhD in affective/cognitive/social psychology prepares students for careers in academia and research. Affective, cognitive and social processes are fundamental to human functioning and intertwined with all of psychology. Our integrative approach provides strong training for creative, influential research as students work closely with faculty and peers in labs using psychophysiological measurement, social cognition paradigms, experimentally derived behavioral measures, eye-tracking, and neuroscience tools.</p>
             <p></p>Students may earn a concentration in developmental cognitive neuroscience, gaining training in how development influences and is influenced by affective and social processes. Students can also receive research and travel funding and participate in faculty grant efforts.
             <p></p> 
             <p>Our department and program value a collaborative and integrative approach to psychological science. This approach fosters intellectual curiosity and innovation, invests in people in a supportive and inclusive environment, and serves the public good. Our PhD candidates have a variety of options for lab work-in emotion regulation, decision making, social perception, affect and social influence, and the cognition behind trust and dishonesty. Students have the opportunity to work across disciplines with faculty and researchers in the clinical and developmental areas, as well as neuroscience and psychophysiology. Recent graduates hold positions in colleges, universities, nonprofit research organizations and industry.</p>
