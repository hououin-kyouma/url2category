             <div class="more-less">
              <p>If you are studying a taught master’s course (MSt, MSc, MPhil, MPP, MFA, BCL, MJur, BPhil or MTh), you can apply for readmission to any DPhil course except the DPhil in Management Studies.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>You can also apply for readmission in any of these cases:</p>
              <ul>
               <li>BCL, MJur, MPhil in Law and MSt in Legal Research students applying to the DPhil in Law;</li>

             </div>
             <h2 id="deadlines">When to apply</h2>
             <p>You can check the deadlines for each course on our course pages.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>January deadlines<br><strong>Monday 8 January 2018</strong> or <strong>Friday 19 January 2018</strong>, depending on your course</h3>
             <p>All courses use one of these two deadlines.</p>
             <p>You should apply by the relevant January deadline to be considered for Oxford scholarships. We also strongly recommend that you apply by the January deadline if you need a student visa.</p>
             <h3>November and March deadlines<br><strong>Friday 17 November 2017</strong> and/or <strong>Friday 9 March 2018</strong></h3>
             <p>As well as the January deadline, some courses offer another deadline in November and/or in March.</p>
             <p>If you apply in November you will usually get an earlier decision than January applicants, and if you apply in March you will get a later decision. November applicants will still be eligible for Oxford scholarships that require you to apply by a January deadline but March applicants will not.</p>
             <p>You can apply to any deadline listed for your course but you should use the earliest one you can.</p>
             <h3>Applying after the March deadline<br><strong>Saturday 10 March 2018</strong> onwards</h3>
             <p>Some courses will remain open after the March deadline if places are still available and/or re-open later if funded studentships become available.</p>
             <p><a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing">Course pages</a> will show whether the course is open, giving up to one week’s notice of closure.&nbsp;Courses are usually closed on Fridays at 12 noon (midday) UK time.</p>
             <h3>Admissions status</h3>
             <p>Each course will have one of the following indicated on the page:</p>
             <h3 class="more-less"><strong><span class="green-light">&nbsp;</span>Open for admission (one week’s notice of closure)</strong></h3>
             <p class="more-less">The course is fully open for admission. If the listed deadlines have passed, there are still places available for you to apply for and the course will stay open until these are filled. The final closing date will be advertised one week in advance.</p>
             <h3 class="more-less"><strong><span class="orange-light">&nbsp;<strong>Closing within one week</strong></span></strong></h3>
             <p class="more-less">The course will close within the next week, usually at 12 noon UK time on the coming Friday. The specific date and time of the deadline will be given.</p>
             <h3 class="more-less"><strong><span class="red-light">&nbsp;Closed to all applications</span></strong></h3>
             <p class="more-less">The course is not currently accepting applications for 2018-19 study. Occasionally a closed course may re-open later if studentships become available.</p>
             <h3 class="more-less"><strong><span class="blue-light">&nbsp;Open for studentships only</span></strong></h3>
             <p class="more-less">General applications for the course are closed but admissions are open for one or more named studentships, usually a specific funding award and/or area of research. A link will be provided for more information on the studentship(s).</p>
             <h3 class="more-less"><strong><span class="blue-light">&nbsp;Admission via separate process</span></strong></h3>
             <p class="more-less">Courses that do not use the standard graduate application form, like the PGCE, do not necessarily use standard deadlines and processes so the admissions status is not included on the course page.</p>
             <h3>Deadlines for funding applications</h3>
             <p class="important-copy">The January deadlines are the latest deadlines for the vast majority of Oxford’s scholarships.</p>
             <p>For over two thirds of Oxford scholarships&nbsp;only a standard course application, made in time for the January deadline for your course, is usually required. If you fulfil the eligibility criteria, you will be automatically considered. There are some scholarships that you must specifically apply for which may also use different deadlines.&nbsp;Check deadlines and other instructions through our&nbsp;<a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/fees-and-funding/fees-funding-and-scholarship-search">Fees, funding and scholarship search</a>.</p>
             <p>Your academic department may use other deadlines for their funding opportunities, eg studentships, which will be advertised on the&nbsp;<a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-by-department">department’s website</a>.</p>
             <h3>When to start and finish your application</h3>
             <p>You should submit your application and supporting documents well before the deadline. For January deadlines, ideally you would contact your referees and request your transcript in September and apply by early December.</p>
             <p>It is important to apply early to make sure that you are able to pay the application fee and do not need any help to finish your application. The earlier you apply, the more time there is for us to help you.</p>
             <p>In the week leading up to each deadline we may not always be able to answer your questions or help you resolve any problems in time for you to apply by the deadline, especially around our busiest application deadlines in January.</p>
             <p>If your application is not submitted and complete at the deadline, the outcome will depend on whether there is a later deadline available.</p>
             <p>If you miss the course’s final deadline, your application might not be considered at all. If your course does have a later deadline available, your application will be automatically moved into that deadline. You can send missing documents for this later deadline, but if it is after the January deadline then you may not be considered for Oxford’s scholarships.</p>
             <h2 id="multipleapps">Applying to more than one course</h2>
             <p>You can apply to more than course, but you can only apply to any particular course once for 2018-19 study.</p>
             <p>The only exception is applying to a DPhil more than once with a different research proposal. If you would like to do this, contact the academic department you applied to and ask whether your first application was only assessed for the specific project or for the course as a whole. If the department confirms that you can apply again, enter your new research topic and/or supervisor(s) in your new application.</p>

             <p>You will need to submit a full and separate application for each course/project (except for physics sub-departments, see below) along with all supporting documents, including references, and the application fee.</p>
             <p>If you plan to use the same referees, you should make sure that your referees know that you are applying to more than one course and are happy to submit a reference for each application. You should also check that you meet the entry requirements for each course that you apply to.</p>
             <p>You will not be able to study a full-time graduate course alongside any other graduate course at Oxford or any other institution.</p>

             <div class="more-less">
              <p>For some subject areas, you can undertake research either via a doctoral training programme, usually a CDT or Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP), or through a related DPhil course.</p>
              <p>When you apply to one of these subject areas you can then submit up to two further applications from a pre-defined list of relevant courses without paying again. This ensures you will not have to pay any extra application fees due to the way closely-related courses are funded.</p>
              <p>Your options for submitting applications will depend on the course you chose in your initial application. Once you have made your first application, check your course page for your list of options under ‘Multiple applications’ on the first tab. Courses that do not have this section do not have associated courses that you can apply to for free.</p>
              <p><strong>After you have submitted an application to your first course,</strong> you can ask for a fee waiver code from Graduate Admissions using the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.graduate.ox.ac.uk/ask">query form</a>, stating which further course(s) you intend to apply to.&nbsp;</p>

             </div>
             <h2 id="appfee">Paying the application fee</h2>
             <p>The fee is £75 per course application, unless you are applying with a <a href="#cdtwaivers">CDT waiver</a>&nbsp;or for readmission as a continuing Oxford graduate.</p>
             <p>You must pay in GBP (£) via credit or debit card and your card will be charged as you submit your application.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>This fee cannot be refunded, even if you decide to withdraw your application later. The payment will not form any part of the tuition and college fees you need to pay if you are offered and accept a place at Oxford.</p>
             <p>Your application will not be considered unless you have paid the fee.</p>
             <h3 class="more-less">Help with making your payment</h3>
             <p class="more-less">If you do not have access to a credit or debit card, some banks offer a disposable credit card voucher which can be used to make online payments.</p>
             <p class="more-less">It is also acceptable for a friend or family member to make the payment on your behalf, in which case you will need to get their consent to enter their card details in your application.</p>

             <p>All of these tests are accepted for both admissions and visa purposes. You will not need to provide more evidence of your English language ability in your visa application. Whilst UKVI may accept lower minimum scores for visa purposes, the University still requires you to meet these minimum scores.</p>
             <p>Your test must have been taken no more than two years before the start date of your course.</p>
             <p>You do not need to submit an English language test result at the same time as your application if you have not yet taken a test or received your results. Your application will still be considered by the academic department, as long as all other required documents have been submitted. Any offer of a place will require you to submit English language test results at the required level by a deadline set by the department in their offer letter.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>The University checks IELTS and TOEFL results directly with test providers. If you have uploaded a CPE or CAE, you will be asked to supply the original document if you are admitted to the course.&nbsp;</p>
             <h2 id="englishlangwaiver">Asking for a waiver of the requirement</h2>
             <p>At the discretion of the academic department, the requirement to provide English language scores may be waived if you have completed, or are currently completing, a degree-level course that is:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>full-time</li>
              <li>at least nine months</li>
              <li>undertaken at a recognised institution where teaching and assessment throughout the course is entirely in English.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>To request a waiver, write a brief statement giving the reasons for your request and upload it to your application. If successful, you will not be required to supply English language test results as a condition of any offer.</p>
             <p>If you are still completing your course and you are offered a place and your waiver is approved, you will usually need to provide evidence that you have successfully completed your course as a condition of your offer by a date set by your department in your offer letter (by 31 August and generally earlier). If you are due to complete your course after this deadline, you will usually be expected to submit results of an English language test meeting the University's usual requirements instead.</p>

             <h2 id="statement">Statement of purpose and research proposal</h2>
             <p>The length and content varies between courses and you should check your <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing">course page</a> for instructions.</p>
             <p>You can only submit one document in this category with your application, so if your course requires both, you should submit them in the same document with a clear sub-heading for each.</p>
             <h2 id="transcripts">Official transcript</h2>
             <p>You should submit a detailed record of your university-level education up to the present, including courses taken and grades achieved.</p>
             <p>Your institution may require several months to produce your transcript, so you should look into your institution's arrangements as soon as you decide to apply. A degree certificate is not equivalent to a transcript, as it does not include detailed grade information.</p>
             <p class="important-copy">To be considered official, your transcript should be produced for you by the institution where you studied.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>An official transcripts will often have a signature or stamp to certify it, or be sent through a secure electronic sharing system like Digitary.&nbsp;Self-service and/or provisional transcripts provided by your institution are also acceptable for assessment purposes if they clearly state your name, institution, qualification and grades.</p>
             <p>You may need to send in a final and/or more formal transcript as a condition of any offer made to you.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>A degree certificate does not usually qualify as a transcript, as it does not include detailed grade information. You can provide a MBBS certificate in your initial application instead of a transcript, but your academic department may still request a more detailed transcript of your grades before making a final decision.</p>
             <h3>Sending a transcript via a secure third-party electronic system (eg Digitary)</h3>
             <p>If you want to share an official transcript using an electronic system, such as Digitary, please register the email address&nbsp;<a href="mailto:graduate.admissions@admin.ox.ac.uk">graduate.admissions@admin.ox.ac.uk</a>&nbsp;and choose the longest possible time for the document to be available.</p>
             <p>We will then add your transcript to your submitted applications, though you should let us know if you make any later applications.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Transcripts for on-course students</h3>
             <p>If you have not yet completed your current degree and/or do not have access to a transcript of your final results, you need to submit an official interim/provisional transcript with details of your grades achieved to date.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>If you are offered a place on a course starting in Michaelmas term (October) 2018, you will normally be required to submit an official transcript with your final results by 31 August (or earlier, depending on the department’s requirements).&nbsp;If you are applying for a research course and it is not possible for you to meet this deadline,&nbsp;you should ask your department if you can be considered for a later start date for this reason.</p>
             <h3>Transcripts in languages other than English</h3>
             <p>If your official transcript is not in English, you must submit both:</p>
             <ul>
              <li><p>the original official transcript, <strong>and</strong></p></li>
              <li><p>a translation of the transcript into English, visibly certified by either a professional translator, the institution that issued your transcript or an authorised notary.</p></li>
             </ul>
             <h3>Transcripts for students with a break in their higher education</h3>
             <p>You should start by contacting your most recent institution to ask for your transcript. They may be able to produce this even if it has been a long time since you attended.</p>
             <p>If your institution is not able to give you a transcript due to the length of time since you studied there, you must ask them to give written confirmation of this. This should include any details about your study that the institution can confirm, eg when you started and finished your degree, your degree title and your final grade. You can upload the written confirmation to your application instead of your transcript or your institution can send it to us directly.</p>
             <h3>Transcripts for Oxford students</h3>
             <p>Current and former Oxford students also need to submit an official transcript. Guidance is available on&nbsp;<a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/students/graduation/transcripts">how to obtain an academic transcript</a>&nbsp;via the University website.</p>
             <h2 id="writtenwork">Written work</h2>
             <p>Written work is a piece of your writing, usually an essay on an academic subject, that helps the academic department assess your suitability for the course. Your work can be marked or unmarked, published or unpublished.</p>
             <p>Your research proposal or statement is not considered to be a piece of written work.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Other documents uploaded as written work</h3>
             <p>Some documents, like a portfolio or admissions exercise, may need to be uploaded to your form as ‘written work’. To check which documents you should upload when applying to your course and any special instructions, please read&nbsp;‘How to apply’ on the <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing">course page</a>.</p>
             <h3 class="more-less">Submitting one longer piece of work instead of two shorter pieces</h3>
             <div class="more-less">
              <p>Some courses allow you to submit one longer piece of work, usually at least 4,000 words, instead of two shorter pieces. Check your course page to see if this is allowed for your course.</p>
             </div>
             <h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h2>
             <p>Some portfolio items can be uploaded to your application as documents, like musical scores, but you will need to send video and audio recordings separately.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Instructions on how to send us your portfolio and what it should contain are available on&nbsp;<a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses">course pages</a>.</p>
             <h2 id="admissionsexercise">Admissions exercises</h2>
             <p>Applicants to the&nbsp;<a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-mathematical-finance">MSc in Mathematical Finance</a>,&nbsp;<a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-mathematical-and-computational-finance">MSc in Mathematical and Computational Finance</a>&nbsp;and <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-computer-science">MSc in Computer Science</a>&nbsp;must submit results of a self-administered admissions exercise. Each course has a different exercise available as a PDF on the course page.&nbsp;</p>
             <h2 id="englishcertificate">English language test score certificate</h2>
             <p>If you do not have test results at the time of applying, you should submit your application without entering any scores. You can then upload the results at a later time via <a href="http://www.graduate.ox.ac.uk/applyonline">Graduate Applicant Self Service</a>.</p>
             <h2 id="references">References</h2>
             <p>Before you apply, you need to contact three referees to ask if they are happy to to write a reference (ie letter of recommendation) for you. &nbsp;</p>
             <p>Your referees will be sent an automated request for a reference when you register them in the ‘Referees’ section of your application. To give them as much time as possible to respond, you should register your referees as soon as you have started your application, before you complete the rest of the form.&nbsp;</p>
             <p class="important-copy">It is your responsibility to ensure that your referees have the information they need to provide a reference, and submit it by the deadline you are applying to. You should stay in contact with your referees to make sure they receive the notification email and complete the reference in time.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Choosing your referees</h3>
             <p>References should usually be academic, though some courses will accept professional references, as indicated on <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing">course pages</a>. Personal references (ie from family and friends) are never acceptable.</p>
             <p>If you are a current or recent master’s student, one of your referees should be your supervisor or course director from this course.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>You are advised to send your referees the entry requirements for your course so they can comment on your performance against the requirements.</p>
             <p>References must&nbsp;be submitted:</p>
             <ul>
              <li><p><strong>to the online reference system</strong></p><p>Your referees should use the online system and references should not be sent directly via email.&nbsp;If your referees have any problems with the form, please <a href="http://www.graduate.ox.ac.uk/ask">contact Graduate Admissions</a>.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>directly by the referee</strong></p><p>References that you upload to your application or send to our office yourself will not be accepted.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>by the deadline you are applying to</strong></p><p>References are due by the same deadline as your application and other documents.</p><p>The automated registration email to your referees includes the date you enter in your application as the 'Deadline by which references are required’. You should make sure this date is no later than the deadline you are applying to and tell your referees directly if you change the deadline you want to use.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>in PDF, JPG or PNG format</strong></p><p>References cannot be uploaded as Word documents.&nbsp;</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>in English, unless explicitly permitted otherwise by the department</strong></p></li>
              <li><p><strong>on institutional or professional letter-headed paper</strong></p><p>Where this is not possible, eg for a retired referee, the reference letter should include the referee's contact details and current (or relevant previous) position.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>from the referee's institutional or professional email address</strong></p><p>When you register your referees, you must give their institutional or professional email address. If you register referees with a personal email address, eg Gmail or mail.ru, the University will not accept the reference. unless there is no other option and the reason is explained in the reference letter.</p></li>
             </ul>
             <p>You do not need to wait until your referees have provided your references to submit your application. After you submit the application, later references are automatically attached to your application.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Whilst you must register three referees, the department will start assessing your application if two of the three references are submitted by the deadline and your application is otherwise complete. You may still be asked to have a third reference submitted before a final decision is made on your application.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>References are confidential and you will not be able to see their content.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Tracking your references</h3>
             <p>You can track whether we have received your references using Graduate Applicant Self Service and the automated emails we send to you whenever we receive one of your references via the application form.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>References sent by any other means will also be shown in your self-service (not in our updates sent by email), but only after they have been processed and added to your application in our records.</p>
             <p>After this automated request, we will not contact your referees again. We will not remind referees to submit their references or check that they have received the registration email, so you must do this yourself. You should stay in contact with your referees until you are sure that we have received their references.&nbsp;</p>
             <ul>
              <li><p><strong>If we have not confirmed to you that your references have been submitted </strong>in the last weeks before the deadline, contact your referee(s) to check that they received the notification email and are still able and willing to submit by the deadline. If not, you will need to arrange a different referee.&nbsp;</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>If a referee has not received their notification email, </strong>please ask them to check their junk/spam folders. After you submit your application, you can re-send the referee emails from self-service if you need to. If this does not resolve the issue, contact Graduate Admissions as early as possible.</p></li>
             </ul>
             <h3 class="more-less">Adding or changing a referee</h3>
             <div class="more-less">
              <p>Please check details are correct before saving your referees' contact information, particularly the email address.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>If you need to replace a referee you have already registered or change an existing referee’s email address, you can do this for one referee before you submit your application, using the fourth referee slot in your form, for any other referees via self-service after you apply.&nbsp;</p>

             <p>This guidance covers key points you should consider when completing your application.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Our <a href="http://www.graduate.ox.ac.uk/technicalhelp">Technical Help</a>&nbsp;PDF also gives you step-by-step help with the online form.</p>
             <h2 id="course">Choosing your course</h2>
             <p>When you choose your course,&nbsp;read the <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing">course page</a>&nbsp;carefully to make sure that you know the structure and content of the course and that you meet the entry requirements, as admissions to Oxford are very competitive.</p>
             <p>The course pages will also show whether your preferred course is currently accepting applications.</p>
             <p class="important-copy">Make sure that you choose the correct course in your application as you will not be able to change this after you start your form or after you apply. To choose a different course, you need to start a new application - for instructions, see our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.graduate.ox.ac.uk/technicalhelp">Technical Help</a>.</p>
             <h3>Full-time/part-time study</h3>
             <p>Some courses can be studied either full time or <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/part-time-and-flexible-study">part time</a>, though for many courses there is only one option.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Start term</h3>
             <p>You can only start taught courses in the term indicated in the form.</p>
             <p>If you want to start a research course in a term other than Michaelmas (October), contact the academic department directly.</p>
             <h3 class="more-less">Studying at more than one institution</h3>
             <div class="more-less">
              <p>You cannot study full-time at Oxford whilst you are registered on another course at Oxford or at another institution, either UK or worldwide.</p>
              <p>If you are registered at another institution when you apply to Oxford for full-time study then as a condition of your offer you would be required to suspend or terminate your registration whilst studying at Oxford, unless the registration is part of a formal collaborative agreement between Oxford and the other institution.</p>
              <p>If you want to study part-time at Oxford while registered at another institution (or on another course at Oxford), please give details of the other course in your application where requested. You should say whether the other course is full- or part-time and explain how you expect to be able to study both courses at once.</p>
             </div>
             <h2 id="college">Choosing a college</h2>
             <p>When you apply, you can <strong>either</strong>:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>indicate that you do not have any college preference, and a college will then be selected for you, <strong>or&nbsp;</strong></li>
              <li>give one college preference.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>For an overview of Oxford’s college system and individual colleges, please see our <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/colleges">Colleges</a> section and information on <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/colleges/choosing-college">choosing a college</a>.</p>
             <p>You can check which colleges are available for your course on your <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing">course page</a>,&nbsp;as not all colleges accept students for every course.</p>
             <p class="important-copy">You will not be able to change your college preference after you apply, or indicate a preference if you chose not to.</p>
             <p>Whether you choose a college or not will not affect how your academic department considers your application or whether you will be accepted.</p>
             <p>For all matriculated courses (see ‘Non-matriculated courses’ below), if you are offered a place by the academic department then you will be guaranteed a place at a college, although this may not be your preferred college.&nbsp;If your preferred college does not accept you, you cannot give any further college preferences.</p>
             <h3 class="more-less">College preference for multiple applications</h3>
             <p class="more-less">If you are applying for more than one course, you must indicate the same college preference in all your applications, unless the college does not accept applications to the other course(s) to which you are applying.</p>
             <h3 class="more-less"><strong>College preference for current Oxford students</strong></h3>
             <div class="more-less">
              <p><strong>If you want to stay at your current college</strong>,&nbsp;check that it accepts applications for the course you are applying to. If it does, you can choose the college when you apply. If not, contact your college office to ask whether an exception is possible.</p>
              <p>If your college is willing to consider your application for a course they do not normally accept, or if you are a fellow of All Souls College, please&nbsp;<a href="http://www.graduate.ox.ac.uk/ask">contact Graduate Admissions</a>&nbsp;before applying.</p>
              <p><strong>If you want to stay at your current college but apply for scholarships at other colleges</strong> you should choose your current college in the form, unless you are applying for a scholarship that states in its requirements that you must choose another specific college.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>If you choose any college other than your current college and are unsuccessful,</strong> your application will go into the same allocation process for college places as all other applications. It will not be sent to your current college.</p>
             </div>
             <h3>Non-matriculated courses</h3>
             <p>Non-matriculated courses offered by the Department for Continuing Education do not include college membership. You can check whether college membership is part of your course on the ‘Colleges’ tab of each course page.</p>
             <h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>
             <p>The information you provide about your planned funding arrangements will not affect your eligibility for scholarship funding offered by the University, its colleges and departments, or the assessment of your application for a place.</p>
             <h3>Scholarships</h3>
             <p>For most Oxford scholarships, you will not need to send anything apart from the standard course application. If you meet the criteria to be considered for a scholarship, you will be automatically considered. Some scholarships need you to tick boxes on the application form or send more documents, either when you apply for your course or separately.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>Even though many scholarships will consider you automatically, you should check the details of the scholarships you are eligible for carefully. Be aware of the deadlines, which are in January for almost all Oxford scholarships.</p>
             <p>Before you apply, use our <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/fees-and-funding/fees-funding-and-scholarship-search">Fees, funding and scholarship search</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;see the funding opportunities open to you and if you need to do anything apart from apply to your course. You can also check the fees, costs and likely living costs for your course.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Studentships</h3>
             <p>You can apply for departmental studentships using the 'Funding' section of the form. A departmental studentship is a specific type of funding, usually for a specific research project offered by an academic department, for which you must enter a reference code in this section of your application.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>To see if any studentships are available and to find their reference codes and closing dates, check your academic department’s website.&nbsp;</p>
             <h2 id="declaringdisability">Declaring a disability or long-term health condition</h2>
             <p>All admissions decisions are taken based on your academic performance and potential, according to each course’s entry requirements.</p>
             <p>The University is committed to making reasonable adjustments to enable students with disabilities or long-term health conditions - including specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia, dyspraxia, Asperger Syndrome and mental health difficulties - to apply for study at Oxford and participate fully in student life.</p>
             <p>To find out more about how the University can support students with disabilities during the application process, please see our guidance for <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/applying-to-oxford/applicants-with-disabilities">applicants with disabilities</a>.</p>
             <p>If you have a disability for which you usually have special accommodation requirements, we very strongly encourage you to disclose it in the relevant section of your application form. We also encourage you to apply by the relevant January deadline where possible, as early notice will help us to support you in the college admissions process if your application is successful and college accommodation tends to fill up as the year progresses. However, no candidate is guaranteed college or University accommodation.</p>
             <p>To discuss this section of the application form, or anything to do with University provision for specific needs, please contact the <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/students/welfare/disability/contacts">Disability Advisory Service</a>.</p>
             <h2 id="completing">Completing your application</h2>
             <h3>Data protection and nominated third parties</h3>
             <p>We will handle your application in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act of 1998 and the declaration that you sign before submitting your application will give you information on any third parties with whom we may need to share your data as part of the processing and assessment of your application.</p>
             <p>In your application you can nominate a third party, such as a relative, to handle your application. We will not discuss your application with anyone except you unless you nominate a representative in this section. Anyone you appoint will be able to request information and give us instructions relating to your application.</p>
             <h3>Ethnic background</h3>
             <p>The University is required under statute to seek and return information about the ethnic background of all its students for the UK Government’s Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). The information is used to monitor rates of participation in higher education by particular groups of people and will not form part of any assessment of your application.</p>
             <h3>Accommodation</h3>
             <p>While many of Oxford’s graduate students are housed in the wide range of accommodation provided by Oxford’s colleges and the University’s Accommodation Office, no applicant can be guaranteed college or University accommodation.</p>
             <h3>Criminal convictions</h3>
             <p>To help the University reduce the risk of harm or injury to students and staff caused by any criminal behaviour of students, we need to know about any relevant convictions that you may have.</p>
             <p>For information on which convictions should be declared and how the data you provide will be used, please see our page on <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/applying-to-oxford/university-policies/criminal-convictions">Criminal convictions</a>.</p>
             <h3>Qualifications</h3>
             <p>If you have a non-UK university qualification and you would like to know how it compares to the UK grade requirements for your course, you can contact the academic department you are applying to at Oxford or&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.naric.org.uk/">UK National Academic Recognition Information Centre (NARIC)</a>.</p>
             <p>You do not need to convert your qualification into the UK system or provide an official statement of comparability when you apply.&nbsp;</p>
             <h3>Agents</h3>
             <p>The University does not have any arrangements or relationships with agents who assist with the preparation of graduate applications for a fee. All of the information you need to apply to any course is free and public on our website.</p>
             <p>You must complete your own application and give your own contact details.&nbsp;</p>
             <h2 id="submitting">Submitting your application</h2>
             <p>You must upload a file for each of the supporting documents you need to apply to your course - except for references, which are sent separately by your referees.</p>
             <p>The system is not able to check that your files are correct and legible, eg that you have uploaded your transcript instead of accidentally uploading your CV twice. This is your own responsibility and you should check that your documents meet all of the requirements on your course page and in this Application Guide.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>When you submit your application, you must sign a declaration to say that all of the information you are providing is true, accurate, current and complete to the best of your knowledge, and that you will notify the University quickly if any information changes. You must also confirm that the information in your application and all supporting work is entirely your own original work, except where clearly indicated, and does not contain any plagiarised elements.&nbsp;</p>
             <h2 id="aftersubmitting">After you apply</h2>
             <p>As soon as you submit your application you will be sent an automated confirmation via e-mail. If you do not receive this, please log in to your application to check that you have successfully submitted it and can no longer edit it.</p>
             <p>This email only confirms that your application was submitted. Your application will not be assessed by the academic department unless all the necessary supporting documents and references have been received by the relevant deadline.</p>
             <p>Once you have submitted your application, we will review it to check that everything we need is there. After this is done, you will be able to access self-service when you log into your application. You can update and track your references, upload missing documents and check the status of your application in self-service.&nbsp;</p>
             <p>For full information on what happens after you apply, including the timeline for offers and scholarships,&nbsp;please see <a href="//www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/after-you-apply">After you apply</a>.</p>
             <h3>Contacting Graduate Admissions</h3>
             <p>If you contact us, please give your name in exactly the same way as you did in your application and, if you can, send your email from the same address so that we can find your application.</p>
             <p>In the week leading up to each deadline we may not always be able to answer your questions or help you resolve any problems in time for you to apply by the deadline, especially around our busiest application deadlines in January.</p>
