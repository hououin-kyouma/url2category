           <p><strong>Classics and Ancient Mediterranean Studies</strong> (Start at any Campus and Finish: University Park)</p>
           <p>This major is concerned with the civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean world, including the ancient Greeks, Romans, and the peoples of Egypt and the Near East. The study of these civilizations includes their languages and literatures, history and politics, religion and mythologies, philosophies, and material culture. Students follow one of three options. The Ancient Languages option requires study of Greek or Latin, one or more of the languages of the ancient Near East, or a combination of languages. The Ancient Mediterranean Archaeology option is designed for students interested in the physical evidence for ancient Mediterranean cultures. The Classics and Ancient Mediterranean Studies option is suitable for students interested in a broadly interdisciplinary study of the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean. This option does not require study of language, although students are encouraged to study the appropriate ancient languages. All students in the major are particularly encouraged to participate in one of the Penn State Education Abroad Programs and/or archaeological field schools in the Mediterranean area.<br>(College of the Liberal Arts)</p>

           <p>The Elementary Education program at Penn State Harrisburg embodies the four tenets of our conceptual framework: constructivism, authenticity, reflectivity, and standards-based curriculum. Constructivism entails a student-centered approach in which teachers help learners build their own understandings. Authenticity refers to developing professional and pedagogical skills in authentic classroom settings; for example, in the junior and senior years prior to student teaching, the program offers extensive field experiences in a variety of settings that enroll students with diverse backgrounds and needs. Reflectivity relates to consciously analyzing course content and one’s own learning for the purpose of deeper understanding and self-improvement. Standards-based curriculum means that our candidates are steeped in Pennsylvania Academic Standards as well as the standards of relevant professional organizations. Taken together, these tenets enable our candidates to become lifelong reflective professionals committed to the learning of all students.<br>(Capital College)</p>

           <p><strong>Global and International Studies B.A.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;(Start at any Campus and Finish: University Park)<br> The interdisciplinary B.A. degree in Global and International Studies is intended to prepare students for lives and careers in a world that is increasingly interdependent. It reflects a “One World” concept that emphasizes the importance of global perspectives, international communication, and study or working experience abroad. The major combines the expertise of multiple disciplines, including the Social Sciences and the Humanities, to suggest a variety of methods for understanding the dynamic issues facing human beings across the globe. The structure of the major also recognizes the fact that the vast majority of the world's people live in regions other than the European and North American spheres, and that a knowledge of non-Anglophone cultures is an important form of preparation for global citizenship.</p>

           <p><strong>Global and International Studies B.S.</strong>&nbsp;(Start at any Campus and Finish: University Park)<br> The interdisciplinary Bachelor of Science degree in Global and International Studies is intended to prepare students for lives and careers in a world that is increasingly interdependent. It reflects a “One World” concept that emphasizes the importance of global perspectives, international communication, and study or working experience abroad. The major combines the expertise of multiple disciplines, including the Social Sciences and the Humanities, to suggest a variety of methods for understanding the dynamic issues facing human beings across the globe. The structure of the major also recognizes the fact that the vast majority of the world's people live in regions other than the European and North American spheres, and that a knowledge of non-Anglophone cultures is an important form of preparation for global citizenship.</p> 
           <p>The major develops transnational and trans-regional literacy, drawing on coursework both in the Humanities and the Social Sciences to focus on questions of globalization, ethical imagination, and ways to engage peoples and cultures in local terms. Students learn to situate global trends, both macro and micro in nature, in relation to other historical processes. Most courses for the GLIS major will demonstrate a global or regional (rather than national) perspective and address a central topic in one of five designated Pathways: Human rights, Culture and Identity, Global Conflict, Wealth and Inequality, and Health and Environment.</p> 
           <p>The B.S. degree requires six credits in quantitative competencies appropriate to the social sciences. The B.S. degree may include a significant engaged scholarship experience (such as undertaking an internship, job, volunteer position, or period of study) located either abroad or in a majority non-English-speaking part of the United States. <br>(College of the Liberal Arts)</p>

           <p>Immunology is the study of how animals and humans protect themselves from pathogens. Understanding basic mechanisms of immunity provides insights into how blood cells develop and how pathogens are recognized and attacked. Furthermore, understanding the concepts behind immunology is necessary for drug and vaccine design. Immunology covers a broad range of disciplines, including but not limited to microbiology, virology, animal health, genetics, biochemistry, and molecular and cell biology. Students will develop an understanding of normal immune responses to bacterial, fungal, and viral agents and the potential pathological outcomes of these responses. Students will learn about events that shape the immune response, the general biology of pathogens, and the mechanisms by which they cause disease. In addition, basic skills in microbiology, molecular biology, and biochemistry will be acquired. <br>(College of Agricultural Sciences)</p>

           <p><strong>International Business</strong> (Start at any Campus and Finish: Behrend)</p>
           <p>The International Business major is designed to help students prepare for the increasingly international nature of business. Compared with other business majors, this one provides greater emphasis on knowledge and skills that are needed to conduct business in an international setting. This includes issues concerned with accomplishing organizational objectives through the coordination of human, material, information, and financial resources across national boundaries. In addition to the core business courses, students in this major will receive a broad exposure to the complexity of international business through required course work in international business, international culture, a foreign language, and a study abroad experience. In addition to preparation for an international business environment, the major aims to provide students with knowledge of a specific business discipline by requiring the completion of all the requirements for a second business major. As a result, students meet the University requirements for a concurrent major. Graduates of the major should be better prepared to function effectively as employees of small businesses with developing international operations or as members of larger business organizations with extensive global operations.<br>(The Behrend College)</p>

           <p><strong>Psychology</strong> (Start at any Campus and Finish: Behrend)</p>
           <p>Psychology is both a scientific discipline and a profession. Its overall focus is the study of behavior, cognition, and affect, and their associated physiological processes. Research is vital to the discipline of psychology. Investigators collect, quantify, analyze, and interpret data in order to understand the principles and theories of human thought and behavior. As a profession, psychology involves the application of knowledge, skills, and techniques for the solution and prevention of individual and social problems. Bachelor-level graduates in psychology are equipped for various positions in human service agencies, industrial settings, and laboratories. However, many students continue study toward a master’s or a doctoral degree in psychology, while others go on to school in other disciplines, e.g., medical school or law school.</p>
           <p>Students may select either the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science program. The Bachelor of Arts degree requires more credits in the arts, humanities, and social sciences and proficiency in a second language. The Bachelor of Science program, in turn, offers two options.

           <p><strong>Psychology</strong> (Start at any Campus and Finish: Behrend)</p>
           <p>Psychology is both a scientific discipline and a profession. Its overall focus is the study of behavior, cognition, and affect, and their associated physiological processes. Research is vital to the discipline of psychology. Investigators collect, quantify, analyze, and interpret data in order to understand the principles and theories of human thought and behavior. As a profession, psychology involves the application of knowledge, skills, and techniques for the solution and prevention of individual and social problems. Bachelor-level graduates in psychology are equipped for various positions in human service agencies, industrial settings, and laboratories. However, many students continue study toward a master’s or a doctoral degree in psychology, while others go on to school in other disciplines, e.g., medical school or law school.</p>
           <p>Students may select either the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science program. The Bachelor of Arts degree requires more credits in the arts, humanities, and social sciences and proficiency in a second language. The Bachelor of Science program, in turn, offers two options.

           <p><strong>Psychology, Applied</strong> (Start at any Campus and Finish: Berks)</p>
           <p>This major is designed for students who are interested in a liberal arts degree with a concentration in applied psychology. The program features both active and collaborative classroom experiences in addition to intensive internship experiences, and is most appropriate for students who wish to develop a set of applied scientific and human relations skills that will prepare them for entry-level employment in a wide range of government and private human service organizations and agencies, and in business and industry. Because of the flexible and broad nature of the degree, students might also use this major as a preparation for graduate or professional school in business, human services, law, or the social sciences. This program differs most notably from traditional majors in psychology in three ways: it is intended for students who may not be planning to pursue a doctoral degree in psychology that would prepare them for a career as a psychologist; it requires that students learn and apply skills during 12 credits of internship experiences; and it requires that students demonstrate skill proficiency in a comprehensive assessment in order to graduate.<br>(Berks College)</p>

           <p><strong>Risk Management (Start at any Campus and Finish: University Park)</strong></p> 
           <p>The Risk Management major prepares students for careers in a wide range of private industries and public service agencies involving such areas as operations, property development, financial strategy, and government. The major is integrative in nature by crossing traditional business boundaries while offering specific areas of study in actuarial science, enterprise risk management, and real estate. High profile risks are faced by leaders and managers up and down the corporate ladder and require specialized skills, knowledge and preparation. The Risk Management major prepares students for this along with a chance to study risk from three different perspectives by offering specialty courses along with a common pool of risk management courses. This structure assures that the students in the risk management major are equipped with the common tools of risk analysis while at the same time permitting the students to tailor the specifics of their training through the selection of a particular option. <br>(Smeal College of Business)</p> 
           <p><strong>ACTUARIAL SCIENCE OPTION:</strong> The courses in the Actuarial Science option stress the application of mathematical and statistical concepts to the measurement of life and other contingencies, while at the same time giving the student a broad understanding of the business environment. Students in the Actuarial Science option are encouraged to begin the series of professional examinations leading to Associateship and Fellowship in either the Society of Actuaries (A.S.A./F.S.A.) or the Casualty Actuarial Society (A.C.A.S./F.C.A.S.).&nbsp;</p> 
           <p><strong>ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT OPTION:</strong> The Enterprise Risk Management Option prepares students to identify, quantify and qualify the regulatory, legal, financial and contractual aspects of enterprise risk; the management of such risks; and the application of risk financing techniques to control risk exposures in organizations. Emphasis is also placed on the understanding of the principles and risks underlying complex business contracts.</p> 
           <p><strong>REAL ESTATE OPTION:</strong> This option is designed to prepare the student for a wide range of professional opportunities in corporate real estate management, real estate brokerage, appraisal, property management, mortgage lending and banking, development, and governmental service.</p>

           <p>The bachelor of science degree program in Security and Risk Analysis (SRA) is intended to familiarize students with the general frameworks and multidisciplinary theories that define the area of security and related risk analyses. Courses in the major will engage students in the challenges and problems associated with assuring information confidentiality and integrity (e.g., social, economic, technology-related, and policy issues), as well as the strengths and weaknesses of various methods for assessing and mitigating associated risk. The major provides grounding in the analysis and modeling efforts used in information search, visualization, and creative problem solving. This knowledge is supplemented through an examination of the legal, ethical, and regulatory issues related to security that includes analyzing privacy laws, internal control, and regulatory policies, as well as basic investigative processes and principles. Such understanding is applied to venues that include transnational terrorism, cyber crimes, financial fraud, risk mitigation, and security and crisis management. It also includes overviews of the information technology that plays a critical role in identifying, preventing, and responding to security-related events. <br>(College of Information Sciences and Technology)</p>

           <p><strong>Social Data Analytics</strong> (Start at any Campus and Finish: University Park)</p> 
           <p>Social Data Analytics is an interdisciplinary major that prepares students to participate in both a research environment where “big data” is a major source of insight into social and political processes, and an economy increasingly organized around data analytics. Students completing the major will have the technical skills to handle, analyze, apply and present big data, and the disciplinary knowledge to draw valid inferences from such information to address real world problems. The program integrates coursework in the social sciences with courses in statistics, mathematics, information science and computer science to develop the unique skill set necessary to conceptualize data sources in relation to the social conditions from which they arise; to think critically about big data in relation to specific problems; and to derive and test hypotheses through application of data tools and techniques. Students will gain valuable practical experience working with data through a capstone experience and participation in faculty research.</p> 
           <p>This major is intended to produce graduates who are big picture thinkers with the knowledge to formulate good questions and leverage vast stores of unstructured data in answering them. Students will be prepared for careers in government, business, healthcare, and industry. The major also provides a strong foundation for advanced study in social science, law, business and public policy.<br><strong>(College of the Liberal Arts)</strong></p>

           <p><strong>Women’s Studies</strong> (Start at any Campus and Finish: University Park)</p>
           <p>This interdisciplinary major is designed to develop a broad understanding of the study of women and women’s perspectives in all areas of academic scholarship. The focus is on feminist analyses of women’s lives, women’s social, cultural, and scientific contributions, and the structure of sex/gender systems. Women’s Studies analyzes the unequal distribution of power and resources by gender. The interdisciplinary and inclusive nature of the field is reflected in a curriculum that includes courses from a wide variety of departments, courses that deal with aspects of women’s lives throughout history, and courses that recognize the diversities of culture, race, religion, ethnicity, age, disability, and sexual orientation. Students may choose either a bachelor of arts or a bachelor of science program. The B.A. degree is a traditional Women’s Studies degree. The B.S. degree is intended for students with strong interest in quantitative skills, women’s health and sexuality, and/or women and science, or who wish to pursue a multiple major program with other B.S. degree programs.<br>(College of the Liberal Arts)</p>
