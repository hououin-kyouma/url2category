             <h3>Job options</h3>

             <h1>Alternative Certification: Teaching Certificate</h1> 
             <h3>Why you should get this degree</h3> 
             <p>For the aspiring teacher, especially a career-changer, who has a bachelor's degree in an area other than education, an alternative certification program will give you the credentials to begin teaching. License requirements vary by state, but many programs allow you to complete certification while gaining experience in the classroom.</p> 
             <h3>Why a different degree might be better</h3> 
             <p>While these programs offer a quicker path into the classroom than pursuing a traditional education major, many of them are also tailored to specific education needs like the need for more math and science teachers or for more teachers in rural or urban districts. If you aren't flexible about location or subject area, a traditional program might be better suited to your goals.</p> 
             <h3>Job options</h3> 
             <p>After receiving your teaching certification, you will be eligible for positions in secondary school, special education, and potentially, school counseling. You will find options in rural and urban districts in particular.</p> 
             <h3>Salary range</h3> 
             <p>According to PayScale.com, a K-12 teacher's yearly salary is between $34,000 and $43,000, but this can vary depending on the type of school and subject area.</p>

             <h1>Graduate Certificate in Education</h1> 
             <h3>Why you should get this degree</h3> 
             <p>The graduate certificate gives teachers interested in further specializing in a subject area or skill, the opportunity to do so. For example, if you are an elementary school teacher you may be interested in a special education graduate certificate. These programs are typically one to two years, and many are offered online.</p> 
             <h3>Why a different degree might be better</h3> 
             <p>The graduate certificate will enhance your knowledge and make you more marketable in a specific area of teaching, whether it's subject or skill specific. If you want to pursue an administration role or something in curriculum development, you might want to opt for a master's or doctoral degree instead.</p> 
             <h3>Job options</h3> 
             <p>Many with certificates find teaching positions at the K-12 level. Certificates can make you more marketable by giving you a credential in special education, leadership, technology or another area.</p>

             <h3>Why you should get this degree</h3> 
             <p>If you're switching careers into education or simply didn't major in education for your undergrad degree, alternative certification can help get you into a classroom quickly. Some alternative certification programs allow you to teach while you earn a Master's in Education or, more commonly, a Master of Arts in Teaching.</p> 
             <h3>Why a different degree might be better</h3> 
             <p>Not all alternative certification programs culminate in a master's degree. You may want a program that can help you get certified to teach more quickly.</p> 
             <h3>Job options</h3> 
             <p>Earning a Master's in Education or Teaching can often help you attain higher salaries and if interested, positions in leadership roles as well.</p>

             <h1>Master's in Education</h1> 
             <h3>Why you should get this degree</h3> 
             <p>Some states require that a teacher obtain his/her master's degree within a certain timeframe of being hired. Whether or not that's the case in your district or the one in which you plan to teach, earning your master's can help you specialize and make you more marketable in a tough hiring climate. For example, you can add credentials like special education or school counseling to your resume or add to the depth of your knowledge in a chosen subject area.</p> 
             <h3>Why a different degree might be better</h3> 
             <p>Most likely a master's will be a necessary step if you want to stick with an education career; however, if you are in a district that doesn't require an advanced degree to maintain licensure, you may not be required to pursue your master's. Also, if your bachelor's is not in education, you can choose to pursue an alternative certification program that leads directly to a master's.</p> 
             <h3>Job options</h3> 
             <p>A master's degree can lead to a higher salary in a K-12 teaching position and can also open doors to working in administration or education policy.</p>

             <h3>Why you should get this degree</h3> 
             <p>An Education Specialist degree is a newer credential, in between the master's and doctorate degree in education. This degree can be a stepping stone into a career in school administration, curriculum planning or even in college-level instruction. It can also be a part of a bridge program, which will culminate in a doctoral degree.</p> 
             <h3>Why a different degree might be better</h3> 
             <p>The value of earning the EdS is completely contingent on your goals in the education field. If you want to stay in the classroom in the K-12 school system, you may not need to go further than a master's degree. If you want to teach at the university level or become superintendent, it may be better to pursue a doctoral degree instead.</p> 
             <h3>Job options</h3> 
             <p>The EdS will prepare you for more leadership oriented roles within the school system like principal, superintendent or curriculum specialist.</p>

             <h3>Why you should get this degree</h3> 
             <p>The EdD degree is not as common as the PhD in education, but it's well-suited for those interested in pursuing administration, curriculum planning or even school counseling careers. The degree is oriented to the practice of education rather than the theory.</p> 
             <h3>Why a different degree might be better</h3> 
             <p>Some in academia argue that the PhD is a more respected and versatile degree than the EdD. While this can largely depend on the type of position you're seeking, if you know you want to do education research or teach at the university or college level, the PhD might be the better choice.</p> 
             <h3>Job options</h3> 
             <p>Those who obtain their EdD, most often pursue careers in higher level administration with positions such as superintendent, faculty advisor, and board of education director, often at the K-12 level. Options in curriculum planning, policy and more may also be available.</p>

            <p>The Doctor of Philosophy in Education is considered a more academic degree than the EdD. It focuses heavily on the theory of education and prepares those who earn it for leadership roles in education and in particular for teaching positions at the college or university level or for education research and policy work. Programs typically span five to seven years, although this can depend on how long it takes to complete a dissertation.</p>

           <img id="checklist" src="../img/checklist.png" alt=""> 
           <p><em>*Education programs will vary in what elements they require from applicants and how much weight they will place on these elements. For a competitive program, you can expect each element to weigh more heavily on an admissions decision, but check with the programs for specific details on the admissions process.</em></p> 
           <p><strong>Other application elements administrators look for are</strong> volunteer experience-especially that relates to education, professional attitude, attention to detail in your application and of course your story - why you're interested in teaching and who you are.</p> 
           <p>For more specific admissions guidelines contact the admissions department of the schools to which you are interested in applying.</p>

           <h3>Licensing Requirements: State by State Guide</h3> 
           <p>You've earned your bachelor's degree and have decided to become a teacher. What's next? Most states/schools will require you to be licensed to teach (though some charter schools may not require certification). But, how do you become licensed, and what if you want teach in a new state or have the option of teaching in multiple states? Or, what if you haven't been through a traditional teaching program, but are still interested in leading a classroom? The answers to these questions - it depends. Teacher certification can be a confusing process as requirements vary from state to state. We've made the information hunt easier - just select the state you'd like to teach in and find out more about what the requirements for licensing in that state are and where to go to find out more.</p>

           <h3>How to Make Your Application for a Teaching Job Stand Out</h3> 
           <p><em><strong>Author:</strong> Alisha Hipwell is a Pittsburgh-based freelance writer with over a decade of journalism experience. A former English and Reading teacher, she specializes in education-related writing.</em></p> 
           <p>When Lupita Hinojosa, assistant superintendent in the office of school choice for the Houston Independent School District, recently posted an open teaching position, she received over 120 resumes.</p> 
           <p>Hinojosa said such large numbers of applicants aren't unusual in her urban school district â€" the largest in the state of Texas.</p> 
           <p>"As a principal you are bombarded," says Hinojosa, "It's ungodly how many applications you get."</p> 
           <p>Given such stiff competition, new teachers may be tempted to despair of ever getting a foot in the door. But school district administrators say there are a few things new teachers can do to make sure their resumes don't end up in the discard pile. Read on for tips on how to make your resume stand out from the crowd.</p> 
           <h3 class="internal">Edit, edit and edit some more.</h3> 
           <p>Because a sloppy resume implies sloppy work habits, signs of carelessness such as typos, misspellings and poor formatting are the number one reason administrators will discard applicants' resumes.</p> 
           <p>"It's very important to go through your resume, and make sure it's just perfect," says Cynthia Wilson, superintendent of Orangeburg Consolidated School District 5, a rural district in Orangeburg, South Carolina.</p> 
           <p>In addition to perfect grammar and spelling, Wilson and other administrators say that they look for action verbs and succinct phrasing.</p> 
           <h3 class="internal">Include your references' names and contact information in the body of your resume.</h3> 
           <p>In the interest of brevity, many candidates put "references available upon request" on their resumes. But, according to Hinojosa, that's a mistake.</p> 
           <p>"When screening resumes, I don't want to take the time to call you for your references. If you don't have them listed, your resume will probably go to the bottom of the pile," she says.</p> 
           <h3 class="internal">Go longer than one page.</h3> 
           <p>New teachers lacking professional experience sometimes sell themselves short with overly brief resumes said several administrators.</p> 
           <p>"Don't be afraid to go over a page if it's relevant information to your experience and skills," says Hinojosa.</p> 
           <p>What's relevant? Anything that speaks to your ability to teach or that makes it easier for school districts to use you in flexible ways.</p> 
           <p>So if you volunteered as a church youth group leader, coached a youth sport, or worked as a camp counselor, make sure you highlight those responsibilities as well as the teaching and leadership skills you honed in those positions.</p> 
           <p>If you speak a foreign language, make sure you say so â€" even if you're applying for a math position. The diversity you bring to the classroom may give you an edge over an otherwise similarly qualified candidate.</p> 
           <p>Likewise, if you have multiple licenses, make sure you highlight them no matter what position you are applying for. You might not get the science job, but the district may keep your resume on file for a future opening in the math department.</p> 
           <p>"I look for things that make applicants stand out as participants in life, things that say, â€˜I'm more than just the average person,'" says Wilson.</p> 
           <h3 class="internal">Be creative â€" but keep it relevant.</h3> 
           <p>No one wants to see a picture of your dog or catch a whiff of your favorite perfume wafting off the resume paper. But administrators do want to see evidence of a creative and engaging approach to education.</p> 
           <p>For instance, Gay Welker, principal of Faircrest Memorial Middle School, a suburban school in Canton, Ohio recently hired a new teacher who caught his attention by printing quotations from famous educators along the left margin of her resume.</p> 
           <p>"It caught my attention and, ultimately, it worked because those quotes became talking points in the face to face interview," says Welker.</p> 
           <h3 class="internal">Don't be afraid to try.</h3> 
           <p>Administrators said the requirements listed in job postings represent their ideal candidate for any given position. Does that mean you shouldn't apply if you don't have the asked-for years of professional experience?</p> 
           <p>"Absolutely not," say several administrators.</p> 
           <p>"It never hurts to throw your hat in the ring," says Welker.</p> 
           <p>And Hinojoso adds that being eager, motivated and willing sometimes wins out over experience.</p> 
           <h3 class="internal">Cast a wide net.</h3> 
           <p>Wilson advises new teachers with little or no professional experience to "apply a lot of places and be willing and open to going almost anywhere to get that initial experience."</p> 
           <p>Apply for out-of-state jobs and seek out rural or "less desirable" districts that may not get as many applicants.</p> 
           <p>In Wilson's rural school district, for example, she may only receive 10 resumes for a posted position â€" a situation that represents far better odds for a new teacher than he or she would find in many urban and suburban districts.</p> 
           <p>Follow these experts' advice and you will increase your chances of making it through the initial round of resume screening all the way to a face-to-face interview.</p>

          <div class="block"> 
           <h3>Mastering the Demo Lesson to Win a Teaching Job</h3> 
           <p><em><strong>Author:</strong> Professor MacGregor Kniseley, Ed.D. began his 35-year career in education as a teacher employed in non-school environmental education programs. He taught for 10 years in elementary and middle schools and since 1990, has been a professor of elementary education at Rhode Island College. He is the author of "The Guide to Winning a Teaching Position in Any Job Market," based on the workshop he leads of the same name.

           <p>Schools and districts use demonstration lessons (demo lessons) to judge a job applicant's knowledge of effective teaching, classroom management, and professional behavior. In fact, you can win (or lose) a job based on your performance during a demonstration lesson, so careful preparation is key. Below, I take you through how to plan and teach a successful demo lesson.</p> 
           <p>What is a demonstration lesson?</p> 
           <p>A demonstration lesson is simply a planned lesson taught to the interview committee or a group of students. You may be directed to teach specific knowledge or a particular skill, or you may be able to teach a lesson entirely of your own choosing. Job applicants could be asked to teach a 15-minute lesson to the interview committee or to teach a 45 to 60 minute lesson to a class of students. Sometimes, the interview committee may provide time after the lesson to reflect with you on how it went as well.</p> 
           <p>What do employers evaluate during a demonstration lesson?</p> 
           <p>Employers judge qualities related to effective teaching. They often use professional teaching standards such as National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) and state certification standards to define their expectations.</p> 
           <p>Here are five important criteria and the indicators that employers are likely to use to evaluate your demo lesson.</p> 
           <h3 class="internal">1. Organizes and delivers a purposeful lesson.</h3> 
           <p>Today's teachers face high demands for accountability and raising achievement of all learners. There never seems to be enough time in the school day to cover everything. Effective teachers need to be well-prepared, well-organized, and purposeful in their instruction.</p> 
           <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p> 
           <ul class="indented bulleted"> 
            <li>Provides a copy of a formal lesson plan for all committee members.</li> 
            <li>Conveys a strong sense of purpose and knows the lesson well.</li> 
            <li>Has a clear beginning, middle, and end to the lesson.</li> 
            <li>Aligns learning outcomes with standards for learning.</li> 
            <li>Assesses students informally during the lesson.</li> 
            <li>Sequences planned learning experiences with a timetable.</li> 
            <li>Differentiates instruction to help all learners achieve learning outcomes.</li> 
           </ul> 
           <h3 class="internal">2. Responds to all learners.</h3> 
           <p>Effective teachers recognize the wide range of needs of diverse learners in the classroom. They use knowledge of how their students learn along with their students' individual interests, strengths, challenges, language, cultural backgrounds and developmental needs to mold their lessons. In addition, effective teachers collaborate with other school personnel in teaching students with special needs.</p> 
           <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p> 
           <ul class="indented bulleted"> 
            <li>Begins the lesson by getting to know the learners, building rapport, and pre-assessing.</li> 
            <li>Uses interactive teaching strategies such as cooperative learning to engage all learners simultaneously.</li> 
            <li>Checks for understanding periodically.</li> 
            <li>Uses effective "question and response" methods to develop student thinking and interaction.</li> 
            <li>Causes students to think in different ways (e.g., includes lower and higher level questions).</li> 
            <li>Differentiates instruction to engage all learners using hands-on, multi-sensory learning.</li> 
            <li>Uses instructional technology if the IT adds value to student learning.</li> 
            <li>Brings the lesson to a close by allowing students to self-assess and/or summarize their learning.</li> 
           </ul> 
           <h3 class="internal">3. Manages individual learners and the whole class.</h3> 
           <p>Effective teachers create the conditions for a safe, productive learning environment. They have a plan for a well-managed classroom, based on a learning community, structures, routines, and clear expectations and instructions.</p> 
           <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p> 
           <ul class="indented bulleted"> 
            <li>Quickly sets several "ground rules" for successful learning (e.g. respect, safety, responsibility).</li> 
            <li>Provides clear instructions and expectations.</li> 
            <li>Makes smooth transitions from the whole class to small groups.</li> 
            <li>Paces the delivery of the lesson appropriately.</li> 
            <li>Uses specific positive feedback to motivate students and set a positive tone for learning.</li> 
           </ul> 
           <h3 class="internal">4. Reflects and makes adjustments in the moment of teaching.</h3> 
           <p>Effective teachers work from a well-conceived plan of action. However, during instruction they should monitor their students' learning and make changes to their lesson plans as needed.</p> 
           <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p> 
           <ul class="indented bulleted"> 
            <li>Uses results of formative assessment to make instructional decisions.</li> 
            <li>Is flexible, yet maintains a focus on the purpose of learning.</li> 
            <li>Changes directions if students aren't achieving learning outcomes.</li> 
            <li>Re-teaches if it's clear students are confused or need more information.</li> 
           </ul> 
           <h3 class="internal">5. Self-assesses and thinks critically.</h3> 
           <p>Effective teachers are "reflective practitioners." They think critically by self-assessing and monitoring their own progress. They relate standards, theory and research of teaching to their teaching. They problem solve and analyze situations to deliver the best possible lessons.</p> 
           <p><strong>Indicators:</strong></p> 
           <ul class="indented bulleted"> 
            <li>Explains two or three things that worked well to help students achieve the learning outcome.</li> 
            <li>Identifies one or two challenges and explains how to improve student learning.</li> 
            <li>Focuses on individual student learning more than the procedures of teaching.</li> 
            <li>Uses assessment information to improve instruction.</li> 
            <li>Refers to results of informal assessments.</li> 
            <li>Requests feedback from the committee and listens to it carefully.</li> 
            <li>Relates self-assessment and feedback to goals for future professional learning.</li>

           <p><em><strong>Author:</strong> Calvin Hennick, a former middle-school teacher, has written about education for Teacher magazine, Scholastic Instructor, and the Boston Globe.</em></p> 
           <p>Have the desire to lead a classroom full of kids toward new discoveries, but lack the credentials? Maybe you've got a college degree, but it's not in education? Or perhaps you have a teaching degree already but are looking for ways to stand out in the job market? Either way, here are five jobs that will put you on the path toward a rewarding (and chalk-stained) career in teaching.</p> 
           <ul id="slider2"> 
            <li> <img src="../img/charts/new1.jpg" alt=""> <h3 class="new-teachers">Teaching English Abroad</h3> <p>Teaching your native tongue to others not only allows you to see the world; it gives you a chance to start off your teaching career with a subject you're already an expert in. The Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) program is one of the best-known opportunities for teaching overseas, but there's also demand for English teachers in China, Thailand, Chile, Argentina, and a host of other countries.</p> <p><em>Necessary qualifications:</em> Requirements vary from program to program, but in general, you'll have better luck landing a gig if you've got a college degree and can speak some of the language of the country where you're seeking work.</p> <p><em>How it will help you later:</em> You'll get in-classroom experience â€" plus, if you eventually want to teach a foreign language in the States, you'll have an edge over applicants who haven't lived abroad.</p> </li> 
            <li> <img src="../img/charts/new2.jpg" alt=""> <h3 class="new-teachers">Tutoring</h3> <p>Did you ace the SAT, or were you a whiz at American history? Share your knowledge. Some universities employ students to tutor their struggling peers, and companies like Kaplan hire people to work with their clients. Or, if you're enterprising, you can start your own service.</p> <p><em>Necessary qualifications:</em> Anyone can put out an ad saying they're a tutor, but you'll command a higher wage and get word-of-mouth referrals only if you know your stuff. Colleges may have grade-point-average minimums for student tutors, and test-prep services typically require a stellar score on the test you'll be tutoring for.</p> <p><em>How it helps you later:</em> When a hiring principal asks you about individualized instruction, you'll be able to start your answer with, "Here are some things I learned in my tutoring days..."</p> </li> 
            <li> <img src="../img/charts/new3.jpg" alt=""> <h3 class="new-teachers">Substitute Teaching</h3> <p>Substitute teachers are famous targets for spitballs, but if you're willing to dodge them, answer your phone at 5 am and rush to fill in for the flu-ridden geometry teacher â€" subbing can be a good way to get your foot in the door.</p> <p><em>Necessary qualifications:</em> In some states, substitute teachers need only a high-school diploma or GED, while other states require full teacher certification.</p> <p><em>How it helps you later:</em> You may get offered a full-time job when a slot opens up at a school where you've subbed.</p> </li> 
            <li> <img src="../img/charts/new4.jpg" alt=""> <h3 class="new-teachers">Preschool/Daycare</h3> <p>This is about as close as you can get to a K-12 teaching job, other than the real thing. You're teaching kids all day â€" just younger ones!</p> <p><em>Necessary qualifications:</em> As with substituting, this varies by state.</p> <p><em>How it helps you later:</em> Nothing hones your classroom management skills like trying to corral a crowd of toddlers. Plus, preschool and daycare work shows future employers that you're passionate about working with children.</p> </li> 
            <li> <img src="../img/charts/new5.jpg" alt=""> <h3 class="new-teachers">Alternative Teaching Programs</h3> <p>Programs like Teach for America have their own training programs that allow people to go straight into the classroom, without first obtaining a teaching degree. Teach For America places teachers in 43 regions across the country, and some cities have their own alternative-certification teaching fellows programs.</p> <p><em>Necessary qualifications:</em> Admission to these programs is typically competitive, and all require a four-year degree.</p> <p><em>How it helps you later:</em> You'll start your teaching career with a built-in network of colleagues who may later be able to help you connect with advancement opportunities. Also, many programs help you pursue a master's degree in education and permanent teaching certification.</p> </li>

           <h3>The 5 Education News Stories Every Aspiring Teacher Should Follow</h3> 
           <p><em><strong>Author:</strong> Calvin Hennick, a former middle-school teacher, has written about education for Teacher magazine, Scholastic Instructor, and the Boston Globe.</em></p> 
           <p>Lately, the news has been filled with stories about education, from cheating scandals to union protests, charter schools, teacher assessments and more. In fact, there's so much going on in education these days, that for an aspiring educator, it might be difficult to sift through all the debates and understand just what these current events mean for the future of the education field. Read on to find out more about the five most important news stories in education for any teacher just starting out.</p> 
           <ul id="slider3"> 
            <li> <img src="../img/charts/more1.jpg" alt=""> <h3 class="new-teachers">Standardized Testing</h3> <p>Thanks in part to the <em>No Child Left Behind</em> legislation passed a decade ago, there's never been a greater emphasis on students filling in ovals with No. 2 pencils. There are some good reasons for that â€" for example, the US lags behind other industrialized countries in math and science, and students of color and low-income students tend to receive lower scores than their peers in this country do. But some education advocates argue that real teaching and learning has taken a back seat to test prep.</p> <p><em>How it affects you:</em> You're not going into teaching because you love giving out multiple choice tests, so make sure that's only a small part of your job. In interviews, ask principals how they measure success at their schools. Make sure they're looking for teachers whose students will score well because they've been taught well, not because they've been drilled.</p> </li> 
            <li> <img src="../img/charts/more2.jpg" alt=""> <h3 class="new-teachers">Charter Schools</h3> <p>Charter schools receive public money but aren't subject to all the same regulations as traditional public schools. In exchange for this freedom, charters are held to high standards and may be closed down if they fail to meet them. Typically, teachers at charter schools aren't unionized, and these jobs may pay differently â€" sometimes more, sometimes less â€" than equivalent positions in public schools.</p> <p><em>How it affects you:</em> Many charter schools will hire uncertified teachers, so if you don't meet certification requirements in your district â€" for example, you lack an education degree â€" these schools may still be an option for you. Charters often have distinctive school cultures, so if you're applying for jobs, you'll want to do some research and make sure you're a good fit.</p> </li> 
            <li> <img src="../img/charts/more3.jpg" alt=""> <h3 class="new-teachers">Merit Pay</h3> <p>If you do a better job than your coworkers, should you get paid more? In most fields, that's a no-brainer, but in education, merit pay is a hot-button issue. Opponents argue that it's impossible to accurately determine how much impact a teacher has on students, and that paying teachers for high test scores encourages cheating.</p> <p><em>How it affects you:</em> It probably won't, at least right away â€" but it's worth keeping an eye on. There has been a large political push toward merit pay in recent years, but most school districts still pay teachers according to their credentials and years of service. Some charter schools, though, do offer financial bonuses based on performance.</p> </li> 
            <li> <img src="../img/charts/more4.jpg" alt=""> <h3 class="new-teachers">Weakening Union Power</h3> <p>As the costs for benefits such as health insurance have skyrocketed, states facing budget crunches have looked for ways to save money â€" and sometimes, that means stepping on the toes of the teachers union. Wisconsin made national headlines when teachers protested legislation that limits employees' ability to collectively bargain, and Massachusetts recently limited the ability of teachers unions to block changes to their health benefits.</p> <p><em>How it affects you:</em> Health insurance and pension benefits should be taken into account, along with salary, when evaluating a job offer. Knowing the political landscape of the state and district where you want to work will help you determine whether those benefits are likely to face significant cuts in the near future.</p> </li> 
            <li> <img src="../img/charts/more5.jpg" alt=""> <h3 class="new-teachers">The Achievement Gap</h3> <p>More than five decades after schools in the U.S. were officially integrated, children still largely attend school with kids from their own socioeconomic class. Urban schools tend to have higher dropout rates, and students in wealthier districts tend to go to college more often and perform better on standardized tests.</p> <p><em>How it affects you:</em> Working in a poor urban district offers different challenges â€" and rewards â€" from those working in a wealthy suburb. Urban schools aren't being ignored like they once were. Over the last two decades, there's been a movement, involving charter schools, big-city mayors, and programs like Teach for America to improve education for inner-city students. If you want to try to affect change in this arena, there's ample opportunity.</p> </li>

            <h3>Top tech practices for new teachers</h3> 
            <p><em><strong>Author:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://gradschool.marlboro.edu/academics/edtech/faculty">Caleb Clark</a> is the director of the Marlboro College Graduate School EdTech program, where he also teaches and helps with academic technology support. He has been a Web geek since 1994 and an educational technologist since 1999. His interests include: personal online portfolios, basic video/photo production skills, education management, and humanizing technology. Caleb is on the board of <a target="_blank" href="http://neighborhoodschoolhouse.com/">Neighborhood School House</a>, a PreK-6, local progressive school and is a technology integration consultant for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.putneycentral.org/">Putney Central Elementary School</a>.</em> </p>
           </div> 
           <div class="accordionContent"> 
            <p>I'm the director of an educational technology <a target="_blank" href="http://gradschool.marlboro.edu/academics/edtech/ma/">master's program</a>. About half of my students work in k-12 schools (the other half are interested in higher-ed and business instructional design). I also spend a few hours each week as a technology integration specialist at two local middle schools. Basically, this means I'm helping educators figure out how to fit and use technology in their classrooms. I'm often fielding questions like, "How do I use iMovie?" or "What does it take to make a Wiki for my students?" Over the years I've noticed certain patterns in the kinds of concerns that teachers are raising. Below is my advice on how to deal with these concerns from figuring out which tools to use for your lessons to helping students become self-motivated about using technology for their work.</p> 
            <ul class="plain"> 
             <li><strong>1. Tools:</strong> When it comes to figuring out which technology tools to use in your lesson plans, let go of needing specific software knowledge, and focus on student learning. Many teachers stress about which software to choose for projects and then stress about how to use that software. Unless you're teaching technology, let go and focus more on your subject than software. In this digital age, there are more tools than ever. You don't have to get caught up learning all of them. Instead assign your students a project - like asking them to make a movie or a slideshow - and they'll be bound to find 10 tools to complete the assignment that you weren't even thinking about. Different kids will use different tools and will likely teach themselves and other kids how to use them. Your job is to focus on the content - review the movies and make sure that your students understood the assignment, and what you were trying to teach. Help them rework the content if needed.</li> 
             <li><strong>2. Constants:</strong> It's easy to get overwhelmed with rapidly changing technology, but remember that even though the tools may change, the rules of good content don't. Some things are constants: the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loc.gov/library/libarch-digital.html">Library of Congress</a> has always been an excellent source for photos, the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds">rule of thirds</a> has always improved artistic compositions, copyright was a necessary consideration long before the Web, and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_literacy">literacy</a> still means the same thing whether or not "media" is in front of it. Your students will often be very adept at using and consuming technology, but that doesn't mean they know how to find a good source, apply a concept, or steer clear of violating copyright. Your job is to guide students in applying timeless constants to new media. Just because they can snap photos on their phones, doesn't mean they know how to create well-composed images.</li> 
             <li><strong>3. Cameras:</strong> And, on the subject of cameras - use them! We live in a digital world now. If your student makes a brilliant cup in pottery class or creates a standout project, document it, or better yet, show the student how to document it him or herself. People almost expect this, and it can give both you and the student a chance for reflection on the project. You can document more than you think with a camera. Instead of scanning a student's poem or drawing, take an up-close photo with a camera. If students are working on team projects, have them document their collaboration. Ask students to use a digital camera to record short videos about what they learned from assignments. Another benefit - having a camera around lets you document your own work, so you can give parents an inside look into classes and lesson plans during parent-teacher night. For more information, I've created an <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/a/gradschool.marlboro.edu/technology-integration-lab/tutorials/photo-video-basic-skills">online tutorial for teachers on how to use any camera</a>.</li> 
             <li><strong>4. Personal Learning Networks (PLNs):</strong> You might be able to keep up with some technologies alone, but there is almost always more power in numbers. We are living in an age of incredibly fast-changing technology. Just imagine the first two decades after the printing press came into widespread use - at the time, teachers' entire lives must have been upended. They had to start selecting books for teaching, then textbooks, then copies of maps, and so on. The education world has shifted again in a big way. Your best hope to keep up is to rely on your peers. Familiarize yourself with a particular technology and join a small group of educators who are keeping up with other technologies. You'll be able to keep up-to-date on more tools and share different ideas for implementing them. <a target="_blank" href="http://onceateacher.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/pln-your-personal-learning-network-made-easy/">More on PLNS</a>.</li> 
             <li><strong>5. Web-based Portfolios:</strong> Web-based portfolios (efolios) are the single easiest way to bind together learning, technology and media. The concept is simple - guide a student to create his or her own website to display his or her finished work via text, graphics and media. Google Sites and <a target="_blank" href="http://pbworks.com/">PBWorks</a> are good free tools. This seemingly simple task will allow students to engage in self-reflection, increase media literacy, and hone their technology skills all at once. Students are faced with questions such as: Who am I online? What kind of job do I want? What's my best work? What did I learn? What do I believe in? How do colors, text and media combine to influence people's perceptions of me? And, building an efolio is intrinsically motivating to most students since it is personal, social and creative. Furthermore employers are increasingly asking prospective employees to provide a simple link to their resume, bio and work samples, so figuring out how to build an efolio is highly relevant for both you and your students. More info and downloads of efolio templates are at the <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/a/gradschool.marlboro.edu/technology-integration-lab/home-1/portfolio-templates">Technology Integration Lab's efolio page</a>.</li>

    color: #22A5E9;">How to Become a Teacher...No Matter Where You Are Starting From</h2> 
       <h3><b>Bachelor's Degrees in Education</b></h3> 
       <p> The most common path to becoming a teacher typically includes earning a Bachelor's degree in education. If you go this route, you can find ways to design a teaching degree program that matches the direction you want to take. Whether you want to work with preschool, elementary, middle school or older students, most states offer accredited teaching degrees for students across the spectrum of education. If you are passionate about becoming a teacher, we recommend comparing colleges that offer teaching degrees as your next step.</p> 
       <br> 
       <p>Even though you may have many options for becoming a teacher; majors, concentrations and specializations with your Bachelor's program can be diverse, so it's good to start simple. Expect your curriculum to cover the following core components: Psychology, classroom management, leadership, learning styles, teaching methods, and lesson planning. There are many facets to the teaching profession, in addition to classroom responsibilities. When figuring out how to be a teacher, be sure you find a curriculum that covers working with administrators and parents, legislative updates to education and education standards in your state. </p> 
       <br> 
       <h3><b>Alternative Teacher Certification</b></h3> 
       <p>If you already have a degree, but are thinking about becoming a teacher, alternative teacher certification is the way to go. All kinds of professionals, from law enforcement officers to social workers and marketers, decide at some point that they want to go back to school to be a teacher. </p> 
       <br> 
       <p>Sometimes it offers people a change of pace or more structured schedule. Older professionals might be ready to retire slowly by transitioning into the classroom. Regardless of <i>why</i>… if you are looking to find out how to be a teacher, we can help.</p> 
       <br> 
       <p>Like any path to a teaching career, state license requirements will need to be addressed. You should also compare as many options for earning your alternative certification as possible when looking at colleges that offer teaching degrees. Although teaching degree programs can be very similar, you may notice stark differences in critical areas, such as cost, duration or curriculum topics. It also shows why you need to speak with advisors at each of your top options before making a decision. </p>

    color: #22A5E9;">What Do You Major In To Become A Teacher?</h2> 
       <br> 
       <p>All you have to do is scan the specialty options on the left to see how wide open the world of education really is. Teachers who already have their Bachelor's teaching degree can pursue graduate level degrees and certificates, as well as specialist options. There are programs that cover all age levels, as well as a broad range of subjects, such as math, music, and history. </p> 
       <br> 
       <h3><b>Your major depends mainly upon where you want to take your teaching career.</b></h3> 
       <br> 
       <p>Not only can you train to be at the head of the classroom, but also you can put your interest in psychology to work in a counselor role. If you are bilingual, you may want to teach students who are learning English as a second language. <br> </p>
       <p>When choosing the kind of teaching degree that is right for you, go with a path that reflects your personality and interests. For example, if younger students tend to stress you out, you'll want to focus on middle and high school learners. </p> 
       <br> 
       <p>Teaching is a career that requires dedication and passion. That's why you need to carefully consider your many options. If you are ready to enter the world of education, contact the schools for teaching degrees listed on our site.</p> 
       <br> 
       <p>Graduate level programs can lead your career in a myriad of directions as well. Masters programs can position you as a leader in your school district. With an education specialist program, you can administer training to adult professionals in the world of business and other industries. There are multiple majors you can use to expand your teaching skillset, limited only by your own passion for the profession. </p> 
       <br> 
       <p>Once you review the types of teacher majors that interest you, use our list of schools and specialties to examine your options. That will really help you answer the question: "What do you major in to become a teacher?"</p>

    color: #22A5E9;">Guidelines For Colleges That Offer Teaching Degrees</h2> 
       <br> 
       <p>Let's take a look at the top factors that should weigh in your decision when choosing where to get your teaching degree…</p> 
       <br> 
       <p><b>State requirements. </b>We will go ahead and include accreditation in this one as well, since the two concepts go hand-in-hand. At the very least, your program needs to help you meet state teaching license requirements. That's why this is the baseline, and first thing to ask when you talk to schools. </p> 
       <p><b>Degree options. </b>If you want to be an art teacher, you may choose a completely different track than you would if you wanted to become a school administrator or work with special needs students. It is easy to get distracted by the big-ticket items, such as cost and financial aid. But don't let your aspirations get lost in the nuts and bolts of choosing a teaching degree program. </p> 
       <p><b>Student teaching opportunities. </b>Do you have a specific school or student teaching experience in mind already? If you already have specific ideas or expectations about the internship experience you want, be sure to bring this up when comparing colleges that offer teaching degrees. </p> 
       <p><b>The extras. </b>Additionally, make sure whatever teaching degree program you choose fits your lifestyle. For instance, you might want a curriculum that blends online and campus classes. Or, you might want to take a completely online teaching program, and then pursue an internship towards the end. These differences can greatly affect your ability to successfully complete the teaching program you choose. </p> 
       <br> 
       <p>Regardless of where you are starting, if you are ready to become a teacher, we can help get you where you want to go. <b>Use the resources on EducationDegree.com to find and contact schools, learn more about teaching as a career and stay up to date on your state's requirements. </b></p>
