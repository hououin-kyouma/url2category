          <span><h3 id="1-request-transcripts">1. Request Transcripts</h3> <p>A transcript is a document that reflects the completion of your secondary school education or the equivalent. Transcripts list the courses you took, the grading scale used, and the grades (marks) you obtained.</p> <p>The Master’s University prefers that all transcripts sent to us also be accompanied by an American GPA equivalent (given on a 4.0 scale). This evaluation should be done by a credential evaluation service. If your transcript does not already give a cumulative GPA on a 4.0 scale, then please have such an evaluation performed. We suggest the following two evaluators, though others are available. Look for a credential evaluation service that holds an NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services) membership, to ensure the highest possible accuracy in your transcript evaluation. Please follow the instructions on the evaluators’ websites.</p> 
           <ul> 
            <li> <p><a href="http://www.wes.org/" title="WES">World Education Services</a></p> </li>

           </ul> <p>All transcripts must be officially translated into English, and bear both the original signature (not a photocopy) of the school official and the official school seal.</p> <p>Transfer Students (those who have completed any post-secondary coursework) should also have their college or university transcripts submitted, likewise officially translated into English. Transfer students seeking transfer credit should make sure to have a course-by-course evaluation performed, if needing their transcripts evaluated according to paragraph 2, above.</p> <p>Please keep in mind that it may take several weeks for your school to process and mail an official transcript (in addition to the time the transcripts spend in transit, which varies from country to country). Likewise, the evaluation process may also take several days or weeks. Accordingly, please submit your transcripts requests early in the application process.</p> <p>All official and evaluated transcripts should be sent to:</p> <p>The Master’s University - Office of Admissions 21726 Placerita Canyon Road Santa Clarita, CA 91321 <em>USA</em></p> <h3 id="2-submit-english-language-test-score">2. Submit English Language Test Score</h3> <p>Your academic success at The Master’s University depends a great deal upon your fluency in the English language. In order to determine your level of proficiency, international applicants must sit for the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or the IELTS (International English Language Testing System).</p> <p>The TOEFL is an official exam supervised by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). The service sends an official report noting your score on the exam to an institution of your choice. You may obtain information about this test at <a href="http://www.toefl.org/">www.toefl.org</a>. When you apply for the test you may have your results sent to The Master’s University by referencing our school code, which is 4411.</p> <p>To be considered for admission to The Master’s University, applicants must earn a score of at least 80 on the internet-based (iBT) TOEFL or a 550 on paper-based version.</p> <p>IELTS is jointly managed by the British Council, IDT:IELTS Australia, and the University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations. Information about sitting for the IELTS can be found on their web site at <a href="http://www.ielts.org/">www.ielts.org</a>. The Master’s University requires a band score of 6.5 or higher.</p> <p>Registration for these exams often must be secured several months in advance. Please plan accordingly.</p> <p>Note to Native English Speakers: If you are a native English speaker, you should take either the SAT or ACT, in lieu of the TOEFL or IELTS. Our school code for the SAT is 4411, and for the ACT it is 0303.</p> <p>Note to Transfer Students: If you have completed 24 or more semester units of transferable coursework at an accredited American university or college (but not just in an ESL program), the requirements for submitting exam scores (TOEFL, IELTS, SAT, or ACT) are waived.</p> <h3 id="3-send-pastor-recommendation">3.

Once an international student receives his or her acceptance letter and financial aid award package, an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility may be obtained with the assistance of our Designated School Official (DSO). The I-20 can in turn be used to apply for an F-1 visa as a U.S. embassy or consulate. Of course, you as an individual are responsible for obtaining and maintaining a valid passport from your home country.</p> <p>Before an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility can be issued, the United States Department of State government requires that each international student be able to document his or her ability to afford an education at The Master’s University. Once you have received your financial aid package, you will be asked to submit documentation regarding the remainder of needed funds. This documentation can come from you the student, your family, or any number of sponsors. Each person must fill out, sign, and return the appropriate affidavit of support (see below) with a bank statement or letter from a bank official verifying the availability of funds. Again, we require these documents before we can begin to prepare your I-20, the document that will allow you to apply for an F-1 visa at an American consulate or embassy.</p> <p>Please do not submit these forms until you have been notified to do so by the Office of International Student Advancement:</p>

           </ul> <p>Additional information about obtaining and maintaining your visa and/or F-1 student status will be provided once you have been accepted to The Master’s University and have received your financial aid package. In the meantime, general information about applying for a student visa can be found on the U.S. Government’s “Study in the States” website <a href="http://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/">here</a>.</p> </span>

      <div id="faq" class="col s12"> 
       <h1>Admissions - Frequently Asked Questions</h1> 
       <h3>Where is The Master’s University Located?</h3> 
       <p>We’re tucked into a cozy canyon community about 30 minutes up the freeway from downtown L.A , the beach or Hollywood!</p> 
       <h3>When can I visit the school?</h3> 
       <p>That’s a great question because there are so many choices. First off, you should know that our doors are always open. Drop in whenever you want. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are great because that’s when we hold chapel services, but you can experience our heart for the Lord any day of the week. If you’re up for a more structured event, we hold College View Weekends twice a year. You can also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/admissions/#visit" title="Personalized Visit">schedule a personalized tour</a> with a few mouse clicks.</p> 
       <h3>What are the TMU school codes?</h3> 
       <p>They are:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>FAFSA School Code: 001220</li> 
        <li>SAT School Code: 4411</li> 
        <li>ACT Code: 0303</li> 
       </ul> 
       <h3>What kind of financial aid is offered at TMU?</h3> 
       <p>The important thing to know here is that a TMU education is a LOT more affordable than you think. We offer federal, state, institutional aid in the form of grants, loans, need based and merit based scholarships, and work study programs. Most of our students (93% at last count) receive some form of financial – why not you? The average TMU student receives over $20,000 in financial aid each year. Just make sure to get your application in early and to submit your FAFSA!</p> 
       <h3>How much will TMU cost for&nbsp;<span>me personally</span>?</h3> 
       <p>Great question! Seeing how everyone’s financial situation is different, we recommend using our Total Price Calculator. To access our Total Price Calculator,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/total-cost-calculator" target="blank" title="Total Cost Calculator">click here</a>.</p> 
       <h3>How many programs do we offer?</h3> 
       <p>This answer surprises people because they think we only offer Bible classes. The truth is we are a liberal arts college built on a biblical foundation, and that means variety. We offer 13 majors and over 55 areas of study.</p> 
       <h3>What are the top 6 majors?</h3> 
       <p>Hmmm … that’s a tough question. We think all of our majors are great. But if we must rank them, our most attended are: Business, Biology, Communication, Bible, and Music.</p> 
       <h3>Will my credits transfer from________________?</h3> 
       <p>We get this one a lot. The answer depends on a few factors: Namely, where are the credits coming from (the college must be accredited) and what kind of grades did you earn (nothing below a C is accepted). And yes, we do accept CLEP, AP, and IB credits. Check out our articulation agreements with CA schools at <a href="/articulation" title="here">www.masters.edu/articulation</a></p> 
       <h3>How many units do I need to be considered a transfer student?</h3> 
       <p>The magic number here is 24 semester units (36 quarter units), and those need to be credits that you completed after high school graduation.&nbsp;But don’t sweat it. If you have less than 24 units, we’ll just go off your high school transcript and test scores.</p> 
       <h3>What is the average class size at TMU?</h3> 
       <p>We love this question because it highlights one of our best features: personal attention. Our lower division classes range from 30-40 students, and our upper division classes are limited to about 8-15. Some Bible classes are bigger (close to 100 students), but over the past four years, our average class size is 20-25 students. That’s a great environment in which too engage your professors – and for them to engage you!</p> 
       <h3>What is the student/teacher ratio?</h3> 
       <p>The ratio is 10-to-1. In other words, you will get to know your profs. And they will get to invest in you.</p> 
       <h3>What classes should I take if I am transferring to TMU from a community college?</h3> 
       <p>The first place to look for answers to this one is in our <a href="http://www.masters.edu/catalog">Academic Catalog</a> – lots of helpful specifics there. After that, you should talk to one of our <a href="http://www.masters.edu/admissions/#counselors" title="Bios">counselors </a>(they’re extremely helpful and they speak in plain English) or go straight to the Registrar’s Office – the buck stops there. You’ll be glad to know we have <a href="http://www.masters.edu/articulation">articulation agreements</a> with most community colleges in California, Oregon, Washington, and some in Arizona. We’ll contact them for you and help you sort it all out.</p> 
       <h3>What kind of rules does TMU have?</h3> 
       <p>The most important rule you need to know about is also the rule that’s most important to us: we call it the Rule of Grace. It governs the rest of them, so we’ll start there. After that, we have a small handful of parameters (recently revised). Check out the&nbsp;<a href="/handbook" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a> for the details.</p> 
       <h3>Is chapel required?</h3> 
       <p>Chapel is the hub of the TMU community and attendance is required. Chapel meets three times per week and students can miss up to six per semester.</p> 
       <h3>What sports are offered at TMU?</h3> 
       <p>You'll find Mustangs competing on the following teams:</p> 
       <p><strong>MEN</strong></p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Basketball</li> 
        <li>Baseball</li> 
        <li>Soccer</li> 
        <li>X-Country</li> 
        <li>Track</li> 
        <li>Golf</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p><strong>WOMEN</strong></p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Basketball</li> 
        <li>Soccer</li> 
        <li>X-Country</li> 
        <li>Track</li> 
        <li>Volleyball</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>We also offer a fierce (and fun) menu of intramural sports: Basketball, Volleyball, Ultimate Frisbee, Softball, Golf, Tennis, Flag Football, Soccer, Dodge Ball.</p> 
       <p>Pack your cleats.</p> 
       <h3>What is the male/female ratio at TMU?</h3> 
       <p>While many Christian colleges operate on a female/male ratio of two or even three to one, we’ve got a level playing field here. Translation: our guy-to-gal ratio is 1-to-1. Sorry, guys.</p> 
       <h3>Can I bring a car to school?</h3> 
       <p>Remember, this is L.A. Of course you can bring a car (but you can get by without it). Just pack an extra $45 per semester to cover the parking fee. And make sure to read the parking signs!</p> 
       <h3>Are there any restrictions on having a car at TMU?</h3> 
       <p>A few. The first is obvious – make sure your car is properly registered and adequately insured (the state of California came up with that one). You should also know that you can’t just park anywhere. But you do have dorm parking. Finally, for you do-it-yourselfers, make sure you get permission before you decide to throw your car up on blocks and change out the transmission in front of Hotchkiss Hall.</p> 
       <h3>Is our campus secure?</h3> 
       <p>Absolutely. Our students are our most precious commodity, and we take our stewardship of them seriously. We are situated in a quiet, safe neighborhood, but we take nothing for granted. Our campus security officers patrol the campus 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our annual crime report speaks for itself--find a copy <a href="http://www.masters.edu/campus-safety">here</a>.</p> 
       <h3>Can I live off campus?</h3> 
       <p>What? And miss all the perks of campus life? If you must, there are some restrictions. Full-time students can live off campus, if they're over the age of 21 and have come in as freshmen or are married. Some students live off campus (usually with Mom and Dad) and commute. But most prefer the TMU community. You can check out the Student Handbook for more specifics.</p> 
       <h3>What are TMU’s admission requirements?</h3> 
       <ol> 
        <li>Faith in Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior</li> 
        <li>High school graduate, GED, or California High School Proficiency Exam</li> 
        <li>Application</li> 
        <li>Pastor Recommendation</li> 
        <li>Personal Statements</li> 
        <li>SAT/ACT Scores</li> 
        <li>High school and or college transcripts</li> 
        <li>Application Fee: $40 (waived during Early Action)</li> 
       </ol> 
       <p><strong>Early Action Deadline:</strong> Your application must be postmarked by November 15, although financial aid applications can come later. We’ll let you know if you’ve been accepted within 2-3 weeks of receiving your completed application.</p> 
       <p><strong>Priority Deadline:</strong> March 2nd. However, we continue to asked applications on a "rolling" basis even after our Priority Deadline.</p> 
       <h3>Do I qualify for financial aid?</h3> 
       <p>Let’s put it this way, if you don’t, you’re in the minority … way in the minority. About 93% of our students qualify for financial aid.</p> 
       <h3>Does TMU prefer the SAT or ACT?</h3> 
       <p>Take your pick. Either one works for us. But if you take the SAT, make sure it’s the SAT I because we don’t use the SAT II.</p> 
       <h3>What are academic guidelines for GPA and test scores?</h3> 
       <p>There are a number of factors, so we don't publish specific minimums. We're looking for students who have succeeded in college preparatory high school classes, and have earned above average test scores on the SAT or ACT. If a student falls below the recommended test score or grade point average, the student could still be admitted as part of our Program for Academic Support and Success (PASS).</p> 
       <h3>What denomination is TMU?</h3> 
       <p>We believe the Bible is literally true and divinely inspired. If that’s a denomination, then that’s us. Other than that we are non-denominational.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/about" target="_blank" title="Doctrine">Click here</a> to read over our doctrinal statement.</p> 
       <h3>What percentage of the faculty uphold and affirm the TMU doctrinal statement?</h3> 
       <p>Is this a trick question? We hold firm to our doctrinal statement and so does our faculty — all of our faculty … 100%.</p> 
       <h3>How many countries are represented at TMU?</h3> 
       <p>It may be easier to answer this one by telling you which countries aren’t represented. Right now, our student body looks like an international shepherd’s pie. We have students from 30 countries.</p> 
       <h3>I’m from one of those other countries… how do I apply to TMU?</h3> 
       <p>Check out our step-by-step guide for International Students&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/admissions/#intl" title="International Applicants">here</a>.</p> 
       <h3>Is TMU accredited?</h3> 
       <p>We love this question because we’re not only accredited, we’re WASC accredited (Western Association of Schools and Colleges) and a member ACSI (Association of Christian Schools International) and other associations. That’s a lot of letters, and they all add up to one thing: TMU is a seriously decorated, seriously recognized academic institution.</p> 
       <h3>What can I do with my TMU degree?</h3> 
       <p>What can’t you do with it? Build an economic empire, write the great American novel, cure the common cold. A TMU education will help you find God’s plan for your career … God’s unique and perfect use for your unique and perfect array of gifts. Can’t beat that.</p> 
       <h3>Do TMU graduates attend Graduate School?</h3> 
       <p>Yes. Our graduates continue their educations at such institutions as Pepperdine, UCLA, Georgetown, Oxford, Duke, and USC. Twenty percent of TMU students attend immediately and 35% attend within five years. Medical schools attended by TMU grads include Baylor College of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Loma Linda University, University of Michigan, and College of Osteopathic Medicine. About 95% of our students who apply to med school get in. Seminaries: TMU grads have attended Western Conservative Baptist, Talbot School of Theology, Dallas Theological Seminary, The Master’s Seminary, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.</p> 
       <h3>How many home school students attend Master’s?</h3> 
       <p>Home school students constitute about a third of our student body, so we’ve got a nice mix. The other 2/3rds are split between public and private high school.</p> 
       <h3>What is there to do for fun?</h3> 
       <p>We can answer that question with two words in Spanish: Los Angeles. Being 30 minutes from the heart of L.A. means you are 30 minutes from (you can fill in the blank here). Want sun? How about a quick drive to Santa Monica or Malibu Beach? Like to shop? We’ve got a fantastic mall here in town, or you can always zip down the Hollywood freeway to Beverly Hills or Melrose Avenue. Like museums? The Getty is close and it’s free. How about a trip to Hollywoood, Disneyland, or Six Flags (which is right here in Santa Clarita)? You won’t ever be bored. Just don’t forget about your homework!</p> 
       <h3>Do students stay on campus all weekend?</h3> 
       <p>Even with everything Los Angeles has to offer, our students also enjoy just hanging out together on campus. Between dorm life, intramurals, sporting events, plays, concerts, or just kicking back at the Mustang Grill, there’s always plenty to do. Just make sure not to park your car next to Reese Field during a baseball game. Watching foul balls bounce off of windshields is another weekend pastime our students enjoy every spring.</p> 
       <h3>How many dorms do you have on campus and are they co-ed?</h3> 
       <p>We have 8 dorms on campus.&nbsp;<br>All-girl dorms –&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/sweazy">Sweazy</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/dixon">Dixon</a> Halls&nbsp;<br>All-guy dorms –&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/slight">Slight</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/waldock">Waldock</a> Halls<br>“Split” dorms (<span>guys’ halls separated from girls’ halls by a common lounge area</span>) –&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/hotchkiss">Hotchkiss</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/cw-smith">Smith</a> Halls&nbsp;<br>For more information about dorm life check out our&nbsp;<a href="/student-life.aspx">student life page</a>.</p>

     <p><strong>Application Information</strong></p> 
     <p>The Graduate Studies department of the Master’s University welcomes applications from prospective students who are able to present strong academic records and a clear testimony of faith in Jesus Christ. In selecting students, the Graduate Admissions Committee admits those for whom graduation is a reasonable expectation and who offer potential to contribute positively to the graduate studies community.</p> 
     <h3 id="steps-to-apply">Steps to Apply</h3> 
     <p>To be considered for admission into the graduate studies program, you can <a href="https://mastersuniversity.force.com/application/TX_SiteLogin?startURL=%2Fapplication%2FTargetX_Portal__PB">Apply</a> here!</p> 
     <p>The application will ask a variety of questions regarding personal, contact, family, education history, employment history, and church related information. Also included in the application will be several short answer questions about some key theological positions as well as your involvement with your local church and your reason to pursue Graduate Studies with us. You will also be prompted to provide us a brief description of your personal testimony and a 10-15 page writing sample of previous academic work, demonstrating graduate study proficiency (instructions will be included in that section of the application). There is no assigned topic for this writing sample - you are free to submit a paper you have already written for another class or program. However, be advised that in reviewing this writing sample, the MABC Admissions Committee will look not only for content, but also for acceptable formatting, syntax, grammar, and citation. Also, you will be able to provide the names and email addresses of three different references - Pastor or Elder, Educator, Personal (these cannot be relatives). Once you provide the name and the email address of the reference in the application, the system will automatically send the reference the appropriate electronic form and your reference can fill out that form without having to confer with you. If the reference delays in filling out the form, there will be an option to change the reference when you sign-in again to the application, if necessary. Finally, when you submit the application, you will be prompted to pay the application fee ($50) through our electronic portal (PayPal). If you cannot complete the payment using our electronic portal, please contact the Graduate Admissions Coordinator at <a href="mailto:graduatestudies@masters.edu">graduatestudies@masters.edu</a> or 661-362-2652 for other methods of payment. You will always be able to save your application and return to it later to finish at another time.</p> 
     <p>After the application has been submitted, the system will automatically assemble all previous schools you provided in the application and create a list of official transcripts that you will need to mail to our Graduate Studies Office. If your school uses a secure electronic system to email official transcripts, you may do this as well. But please be advised that these transcripts must be official (meaning that they cannot be copies of your transcripts, and they come directly from your school and have not been open by you or anyone else). Of most importance, students applying for graduate studies must have a bachelor’s degree from a school that meets the accreditation standards of the Higher Learning Commission in the United States, with few exceptions. If you are unsure about the accreditation of your school or have any problems sending us a transcript, please contact the Graduate Admissions Coordinator at <a href="mailto:graduatestudies@masters.edu">graduatestudies@masters.edu</a> or 661-362-2652. For mailed transcripts, please have your school send them to this address:</p> 
     <p><strong>THE MASTER’S UNIVERSITY</strong></p> 
     <p><strong>Office of Graduate Admissions Box #50</strong></p> 
     <p><strong>21726 Placerita Canyon Road</strong></p> 
     <p><strong>Santa Clarita, CA 91321</strong></p> 
     <p><strong>UNITED STATES</strong></p> 
     <p>Please make sure to remind your school that the “Box #50” must be included in the address. Some schools have our basic address in their system without the “Box #50.” They may need prompting to include this number. If it is not included, the transcript will arrive in another department on our campus, and it may take some time to track it down. Thank you in advance!</p> 
     <p>Only for students in which English is not their first language, you will need to complete and score a minimum of 100 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Please visit their <a href="https://www.toeflgoanywhere.org/search-who-accepts-toefl">website here</a> and search for “Master’s College” or “Master’s University” in Santa Clarita as the school where you would like your exam scores sent.</p> 
     <p>When all of the application items have been completed and sent to us (online application, recommendations, official transcripts, TOEFL), then your application will be ready for review by the Admissions Committee in the Graduate Studies Office.</p> 
     <p>*Those who went to schools under a previous last name, please make sure to provide your Former Last Name in the application so that we can identify your transcripts. Thank you!</p> 
     <p>**Prospective students of the Teaching Credential, Online program, or Seminary programs should consult those departments for application requirements and procedures.</p> 
     <p>Former or Current TMS Students: Your application will be shorter than what is prescribed above. Please designate that you are a Former/Current TMS Student at the beginning of the application. This will prompt the system to reduce your application requirements automatically. In the application, you will NOT be prompted to provide us a writing sample, pastor/elder reference, personal reference, or TOEFL (for those in which English is not their first language). For your transcripts, we have your TMS record already, so you will not need to request that from the Seminary. However, we will need you to request for copies of your other school transcripts from the TMS secretary (Jennifer Baughman). Please email Jennifer at <a href="mailto:jbaughman@tms.edu">jbaughman@tms.edu</a> and request from her copies of your transcripts to be sent to Box #50, the Graduate Studies Office at The Master’s University.</p> 
     <p>Re-Admit Students: Your application process will be shorter than what is prescribed above. Please designate that you are a Re-Admit Student at the beginning of the application. This will prompt the system to reduce your application requirements automatically. In the application, you will NOT be prompted to provide us a writing sample, educator reference, personal reference, or TOEFL (for those in which English is not their first language). Also, the short answers in the application will be uniquely fitted for you. For your transcripts, please send us only official transcripts of any schools you have attended since the last time you were enrolled as a student in our Graduate Studies programs.</p>

     <p>Applications may be submitted after the deadline, but we cannot guarantee that they will be given equal consideration with those submitted on time. It is preferred that residential-local students begin studies in a fall term. Because the intensive-modular courses form both the foundation and anchor for the entire distance student’s experience, we highly recommend distance students to start the program in a summer term. A distant student may begin in the fall or spring semesters but the he/she must realize that he/she will necessarily need to take classes out of the prescribed order (see <a href="http://www.masters.edu/academics/graduate/degree-programs/mabc/program-outline/">what we prescribe here</a>) and thus be initially limited as to which courses he/she may take in the first couple of semesters. Moreover, students should be aware that some classes will assume the student’s familiarity of previous content from courses that would normally be taken in the prescribed order. In this way, all students will be held to the same academic standards whether he/she is taking the classes in the prescribed order or not. The Graduate Studies Office will help students minimize any potential problems that may result from taking classes out of the preferred order, but it is important that the student is aware of these potential challenges.</p> 
     <h2 id="transfer-credits">Transfer Credits</h2> 
     <p>Credits from other institutions are generally not accepted for transfer due to the unique content and nature of our programs. However, some courses from other theological institutions may transfer with minimal additional coursework. Eligibility for transfer credits is only determined through the transcript review step of the application process.</p> 
     <h2 id="international-students">International Students</h2> 
     <p>The Master’s University is authorized under Federal law to enroll nonimmigrant alien students. Students from abroad are welcome, provided they meet the admission requirements of the University. For applicants, for whom English is a second language, a minimum score of 100 is required on the TOEFL exam in order to be considered for admission. While all classroom instruction is conducted in English, the administration, faculty and staff attempt to be sensitive to the needs of our international students. As foreign students’ legal needs are different from those of U.S. citizens, there are additional requirements. Foreign students are urged to contact the <a href="mailto:iso@masters.edu" title="Office of International Student Advancement">Office of International Student Advancement</a> to obtain the appropriate information.</p>
