          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the popular image of college, there’s dorm life, full-time classes, football games, parties, maybe a part-time job — and then, four years later, a degree. </p> 
          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But for most students, it doesn’t work out that way. About 2.8 million students enroll in some form of higher education each year. But finishing what they start is a different matter: Only one in five of the students who enroll in two-year institutions graduate within three years. And even at four-year colleges, only two in five complete their degrees within six years. </p> 
          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.publicagenda.org/">Public Agenda</a> released an interesting study, <a href="http://www.publicagenda.org/theirwholelivesaheadofthem">“With Their Whole Lives Ahead of Them,”</a> on the college dropout problem. (The study was underwritten by the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.)</p> 
          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Public Agenda surveyed more than 600 young adults, 22 to 30, who had done at least some college coursework, and compared those who left before getting a degree with the experiences of those who completed a two- or four-year degree. </p> 
          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The differences are vast. Among those who dropped out, nearly six in 10 were getting no help from their parents in paying tuition. Among those who got degrees, more than six in 10 have help from their family in paying tuition. <span id="more-13077"></span></p> 
          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">About seven in 10 of the dropouts said they had no scholarship or loan aid; among those who got degrees, only about four in 10 went without such aid. </p> 
          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The top reason the dropouts gave for leaving college was that it was just too hard to support themselves and go to school at the same time. Balancing work and school was a bigger barrier than finding money for tuition, they said. In fact, more than a third of the dropouts said that even if they got a grant that covered their books and tuition, it would be hard to go back to school, given their work and family commitments. </p> 
          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Among those who completed a degree, 72 percent had household incomes above $35,000. Among the dropouts, more than half had household incomes below $35,000. And while 7 in 10 of the college graduates had parents who had completed at least some college work, 4 in 10 of the dropouts had parents who had not gone beyond a high school diploma. </p> 
          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The study also asked the young people what changes would be most useful in helping students to complete a college degree, offering 12 choices. </p> 
          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The students liked every idea suggested, but for the non-finishers the most popular solutions were allowing part-time students to qualify for financial aid, offering more courses on weekends and evenings, cutting costs and providing child care. The least popular — although still considered helpful — were putting more classes online, making the college application process easier. </p> 
          <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Public Agenda report is likely to provide fodder for both sides in the continuing debate over whether the best solution to the college dropout problem is money (whether cheaper tuition or more financial aid), high school reform (students with better high school grades and stronger academic preparation are less likely to drop out) or changes in the structure of college (more flexible class schedules, cheap on-site child care). </p>

           <p>This is why I had to drop out. I had super high grades and worked with senior faculty, but after two years the money was gone and I was starving to death. All my rich friends graduated, thanks to Mom &amp; Dad. Am I bitter? Yes. I should have a doctorate but I couldn’t even finance a third year.</p>

           <p>I graduated from high school in 1981. When I applied to colleges, I had a financial aid index number of zero, which basically means I had zero money to contribute to my education. I came from poverty and that is the truth. However, my grades were good and my SAT scores pretty high so I was accepted at MIT, the University of Washington, and Seattle Pacific University. I chose SPU over the others because they offered me a better financial aid package. It was very tough to finish though, because the financial aid decreased each year which made no sense since my financial situation had not changed. And every quarter I would get hounded by the collections department of the SPU business office, with threats of disenrollment if I didn’t pay up. It was very disheartening. Finally, I pretty much begged and pleaded with them to please let me finish, to please let me rack up a debt, with promises to pay it back after I graduated with a BS in Computer Science. They actually relented, which to this day amazes me. However, after I graduated, they frustrated my job-seeking efforts by not releasing my transcripts. The biggest employer in Seattle, Boeing, was ready to hire me but not without transcripts. SPU wouldn’t release transcripts until the debt was paid. Catch-22! Thankfully, a smaller, riskier company was ready to hire me after an eight-hour grueling interview where I was able to prove my knowledge and abilities, transcript notwithstanding. You might have heard of this company … Microsoft. Needless to say, my life has changed dramatically because of them.</p> 
           <p>My experience has led me to believe that the financial aid office was less than honest by offering me a wonderful aid package, as a way to get me in the door, so the school could get money, if not from me, from the aid’s financial sources. I think if financial aid offices were more forthright in what they can offer students over the course of their college careers it would be more helpful overall, with people able to make realistic decisions about their education choices.</p>

           <p>The numbers are a bit distorted. Colleges only have the ability to track students who graduate from their own schools. Those who transfer to other places, and still complete degrees within six years, are counted as non-graduaters. 6 year graduation rates at elite private liberal arts colleges are typically 75-80%; private regional liberal arts colleges typically see about 60% of those who start their graduate within six years; the flagship publics in most states have good graduation records, but the regional publics often have rates between 25% and 40%. In general, privates out perform publics across the board. Small classes sizes, personal connections with faculty clearly make some difference.</p>

           <p>I was responsible for half of my college expenses, and this was way back in the 70’s. That still took a lot of determination.</p> 
           <p>Folks praised me (and praise other folks) who have this sort of determination, but the question is – is college really supposed to be a test of character. Especially at the age of 17 or 18 or so…</p>

           <p>I’ve been on both sides of this discussion. Personally, I had to take out loans against my own credit since both of my parents had gone bankrupt by the time I entered my first year of college.</p> 
           <p>It took more than four years for me, but I knew the value in getting through all the courses in a reasonable amount of time. I gladly worked through the entire undergraduate years. Being able to ‘work your way through college’ without taking on student loan debt is something that old people say and believe is still possible. They still think it’s possible to live at home and study. I’m sure that the majority of students who could not afford to continue their studies lacked such opportunities.</p> 
           <p>Regardless, this topic is one worth discussing and continuously addressing. Online education is not bad — some of the most challenging courses I’ve taken have been online. And I don’t mean the ‘lightweight’ courses offered by for-profit institutions. It is possible to take Ivy League courses online. I’m now pursuing my doctorate at an Ivy League institution, so it is possible if you stick it out — and you’re willing to take on some debt.</p> 
           <p>As to the article, I think financial aid to part-time students is crucial. I understand the full-time financial aid restriction logic, but opportunities for those doing dual-duty (working and school) should not be reduced, but enhanced.</p>

           <p>One big reason seems to be left out: “Could not handle academics/was unprepared for college.” Surely that is a big reason many drop out. Could it be that students do not want to admit that this is a reason?</p>

           <p>This study ignores immaturity……</p> 
           <p>Tutition at public universities is a few thousand a semester. If you live at home and eat canned food its doable; even if you sell insurance on the side or some other high-value telemarketing on nights/weekends.</p> 
           <p>The main issue is alot of “kids” today dont want to live at home, and follow rules. They want the latest cell, dinning out and clubbing. Soon enough they get/or are pregnant and think it gives them “street cred” to take care of those “responsibilities”, making min. wage.</p> 
           <p>All this could be avoided, if they hunkered down for 4 yrs (not 6) and just stayed at home and went to class.</p> 
           <p>I see immigrants in NYC still doing this and hitting CUNY, while qualifying for grants even though they are on visiting tourist or student visas. Some rack up 30-60 credits, then get their employers to sponsor them, for full citizenship.</p> 
           <p>Work is work…not many want to do it.</p>

           <p>One more factor that he study needs to consider: subsidized housing costs especially in expensive cities like NYC. Most of one’s income is eaten up in rental costs.</p>

           <p>yes, the college experience IS a test of character. It can be done. I personally haven’t done it, but I’ve read amazing stories about students my age who take up responsibilities equivalent to that of two grown, employed adults. I always feel ashamed of myself and thanks to them, I see things a bit more realistically now, I’m better at sorting priorities, and I’m also better at distinguishing between needs and wants.<br> I think 17 or 18 might be a bit too late to start polishing up your character especially since the state allows us to drive at 16 when the decisionmaking part of our brain hasn’t even fully developed. Environment is a key factor in a student’s maturation process, and unfortunately, it is becoming more and more polluted with the junk on television and the vanity on display courtesy of our friends, who I’m sure have the best intentions, but who are probably the most responsible for shaping our personality and character. College is not a paid vacation, unless you’re the one paying. And if you are paying, then you’re not thinking about whether to go to Cancun or some place in Europe. If you’re paying, then you’re definition of vacation is palpably distinguishable from the traditional American student’s.</p>

           <p>A shame. Ask any professor in any department – they prefer the older undergraduate students to the younger students just out of high school. They treated classwork like their job, and while the rest of us worked hard too we sometimes slept through class or flipped through reading assignments. </p> 
           <p>Of course, the way this is going, soon no one will be able to afford a degree. I don’t want to be a cynic here, but maybe the people who drop out are the lucky ones? Counting the cost and dropping out is a lot better than waking up four years later and realizing your loan payments are more than your paycheck. I doubt that many students get their parents to pick up the whole tab; most of them probably don’t realize how much debt they’re in.</p>

           <p>To add to what comment #6 said, yes I believe not doing good academically is one, if not major, reason as to why many students drop out early. This then affects much of what a student’s financial aid will be, whether it be in scholarships and/or financial assistance/grants. If you’re not doing so well with your courses and you either fail them OR drop the classes, then there are penalties with regards to your financial aid (dropping a class may disqualify you as a “full-time student”) and the aid is reduced.<br> Although this may be the reason why the students leave college early (no money), the reason behind THAT reason is one that they are unwilling to admit.</p>

           <p>Part of this discussion needs to be the fact that we’ve created an expectation that after you finish high school you must attend college. I work at a community college, and I see so many students who would actually rather be working full time than attending school. It’s not that they do not want to be in college, it’s just that they do not want to be there at this time. However, a number of outside factors have forced them to attend; the social stigma of not attending college, parental pressure (i.e. if you’re going to live in my house, you need to be going to school), and, of course, health insurance. As long as we have a system that only allows our young adults to remain on their parents’ health insurance as long as they are still full-time students, we will continue to see a large number of students who are just going through the motions, because it is cheaper to go to community college than to pay out-of-pocket health insurance premiums.</p>

           <p>well.in my opinion the most important cause of college dropouts is financial problems..students may not b good at studies but this is not a cause to leave a college..what needs to be done is that rich people should come forward and help the poor..in my own country, Pakistan, i see many children selling newspapers and working at shops. We must stop child labor in developing countries. In Pakistan we also have Afghan migrants child and up till now i havnt seen such an afghan child studying. Though many international organisations are working but don’t know what really they are doing. I have noticed no change so far. Since i was born these organizations are working but no change..</p>

           <p>With regards to comment #7, not everybody wants to go to a state school. Should one suffer growth and sacrifice intellectual development for attending college cheaply? I don’t believe that state colleges can provide the type of educational experience one gets at more highly ranked schools (per US News and World Report). For example, one can’t possibly compare a degree from Texas A&amp;M to Princeton – yes, we must take into account relativity, etc., but I am trying to make a point using extremes. So ‘just sucking it up and going to a state school’ isn’t helping matters.</p> 
           <p>What is more, I go to a school in the top 20 in the nation with the hopes of attending graduate school. I work part time through the university, and what’s great is that I can call into work and not show up whenever I NEED to – say if I have to study for a test. I know for a fact that I could not be making the grades that I am getting, necessary for a highly selective graduate program, if I had to work full-time. I can’t say that coursework has gotten harder because I don’t know what it was like in the 50s, 60s, and 70s where most of the finger pointing is coming from, but it’s not unusual for me to pull two or three all-nighters a week.</p>

          <div class="comment-content" style="display:block;"> 
           <p>I am 30 years old and attending a community college in Alabama. I attended college 12 years ago when I finished high school because A.) I had to,my parents said that I couldn’t live with them if I didn’t and B.) It was the only way that I could stay on their health insurance. Suffice it to say, since I didn’t want to be there I ended up dropping out after 3 semesters with a 1.28 GPA. I decided to take a year off and “try again” for the same reasons listed above, even going so far as to attened another school. Yet again, since I wasn’t going for my own personal reasons, I was dropped from the program because I made a 1.20 at that school. </p> 
           <p>After 1 yr out of that college, I joined the Air Force and it changed my whole life. I took classes to get my Associates in Science from the Community College of the Air Force and graduated in Feb 2008. After spending time deployed to Iraq, I decided that I wanted to get my BS in Nursing. Well guess what…because I failed classes 12 years ago at that first and second school, my GPA is not competitive enough to get into a 4 yr nursing program. I am making straight A’s, but have been informed that I’ll probably never qualify for entry into the competitive career field. WOW, I said. The requirements for all of them are that your sciences must be current within the last 5 years. So if I took Biology and got an A 12 years ago (I didn’t, I got an F), I would have to retake it…this is a catch-22!</p> 
           <p>My point is, why are grades from 12 years ago counted towards my current GPA? If I’m required to retake a class because it’s not current within the last 5 years (no matter what the grade), why is there not a cutoff for classes failed? I’m a totally different person now than I was then. Hindsight is 20/20, but I also don’t think there should be a double standard. I think kids should be more prepared to go to college and go when THEY want to go…maybe the drop out rate wouldn’t be so high.</p>
