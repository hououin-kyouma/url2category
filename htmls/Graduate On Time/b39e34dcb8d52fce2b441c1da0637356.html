        <p>When you went to college the first time, you may not have paid much attention to the whole “college credit” system. You probably met with an advisor, took your suggested classes and just knew you were on the right track to eventually graduate. But now that you’re going back to school to complete your degree, you may wonder what exactly college credit is and how many you need to graduate before you can even think about transferring them. Learn here exactly what it means to have college credits, how to earn more and what they mean for graduation.</p> 
        <hr>Click here to see a 
        <a href="http://collegedegreecomplete.com/online-colleges-universities-that-accept-lots-of-credit-transfers/" target="_blank">list of online colleges and universities that accept lots of credits in transfer</a>
        <p></p> 
        <hr> 
        <p><b>What is a College Credit?</b><br> Unfortunately, there is still no national definition of a “credit hour” for colleges and universities. However, one college credit hour generally means that a student has had one hour of class instruction per week over the course of 15 weeks (a semester), as well as about 2 hours of out-of-classroom work, which could be homework, labs, practicum, etc. Therefore, most core classes for your major are worth 3 credits, because they usually meet 3 times a week for an hour, or twice a week for 90 minutes and have corresponding out-of-class assignments. 2- and 1-hour classes are smaller classes that meet for less time and require less work, like electives, but still count towards your bottom line.</p> 
        <p>For online colleges, credits are counted a bit differently. Since you’re not sitting in a traditional classroom, credits are counted by how many times you log in to participate, and how much time you spend contributing comments, questions and overall discussions to your class. Again, since there are no federal regulations yet, this is more subjective, and requirements vary between professors, classes and schools. But it’s important to understand that even though you’re taking classes online, you still have to participate to earn a good grade and the credit hours that correspond with that class.</p> 
        <p><b>How Many Credits Do I Need To Graduate?</b><br> There is no set number of college credits you need to graduate. This number varies depending on the major and the school from which you are graduating. However, the average number of college credits you need to complete a program averages about 64 credits for a 2-year associate’s degree and 120 credits for a 4-year degree. Some degrees require more; for instance, I had to earn over 150 credit hours for my undergraduate degree in English Education, mainly because that type of program is like combining two majors—English and education into one degree. Your advisor, as well as the school’s course catalog will show you exactly how many college credit hours you need to graduate from your chosen major.</p> 
        <p><b>How Do College Credits Work, and How Should I Earn Them?</b><br> If you’re starting to panic about how you’ll earn all of your credits, don’t. Most programs for each major break down exactly what courses you need to graduate, and show you how to earn all of your credit hours to complete your degree. Each major will have what’s called “core classes,” which you must pass and earn credit for to graduate within that major. Beyond that, you’ll have some choices in the “electives” category. For instance, an English major may get to choose between a poetry class, creative writing class or French literature class to fulfill an elective spot. This is where you can tailor your program to meet your needs and interests. As long as you meet with your advisor and plan out your classes according to your school’s course catalog, you should have all the credits you need (sometimes more!) to graduate.</p> 
        <p>Where counting credit hours really becomes important is when you transfer credits. It’s always a good idea to spend the extra time to get as many of your previous college credits transferred as possible (to learn why, click <a href="http://collegedegreecomplete.com/should-adult-students-spend-the-time-to-transfer-college-credits-or-just-start-over/" target="_blank">here</a>). And the more you transfer, the less you have to complete to finish your degree. Once you’ve completed the transfer process, you can then figure out how many credits you have left to earn, as well as what core classes and electives you still have to take (learn how to transfer college credits <a href="http://collegedegreecomplete.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-transferring-college-credits/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p> 
        <p><b>All The Right Moves</b><br>Overall, understanding exactly what college credits are and how they work will help you go through the planning process for your degree much more smoothly. Once you understand what your graduation requirements are, you can map out a timeline to help you earn your credits in a balanced way, at your own pace. Also, understanding college credits will help you better negotiate credit transfers by making you more knowledgeable about how the credit system works. Then, you can earn your degree with confidence, knowing you’re taking every step you need to get to graduation.</p>
