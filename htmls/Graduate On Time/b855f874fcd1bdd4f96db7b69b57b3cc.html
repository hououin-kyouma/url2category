To obtain the Certificate, students must complete a 12-unit program of study that includes core and thematic courses. The program is designed for students to begin in the fall and complete in one to two academic years. Students will be able to complete the Certificate in conjunction with a graduate or professional degree program or as a stand-alone certificate. The goal of the Certificate is to train graduate students and related professionals to be conversant with the problems of managing natural resources on American Indian reservations and off-reservation areas. We have outstanding resource management programs that are highly specialized at the University of Arizona, but we lack basic training for graduate or professional degree-seeking students who aim to work in the management and administration of Tribal natural resources. &amp;nbsp; </td>

Currently we have a small cohort of students from universities, hospitals, and government agencies. Our program is designed to be completed in two to three years on a full-time basis. Successful graduates of the program go on to complete residencies in Arizona and other states as well as contribute to research and new knowledge in scholarly publications. Tailored Curriculum Designed for International Students Faculty and staff in the certificate program have worked with international students for more than 20 years. We are here to help you navigate the program application as well as support you through your academic, clinical and professional progression in areas such as advanced clinical training for residency, preparation for the licensure and English proficiency exams, and more. Program highlights Our staff and faculty in the certificate program are dedicated to international students and provide personalized support and training to meet individual needs of students. Over 30 pharmacy rotations with a different emphasis (e.g. internal medicine, infectious diseases, emergency medicine, and medication management) are available for students&amp;rsquo; clinical training. Approximately 90% of certificate program graduates move to PGY-1 residency and 80% to PGY-2 residency. </td>

The ANLI program makes it possible for students to pursue the study of language in its social context and linguistic theory, drawing on the resources of both the Department of Linguistics and the Linguistic Anthropology program within the School of Anthropology, without having to go through two separate Ph.D. programs. Potential applicants should clearly address in their statement of intent how their past experiences and future research interests fit with the current strengths of both departments. Both departments have strong national reputations for their contributions to the study of language, and each department has specialized in mutually compatible ways in the kinds of linguistic theory and analysis it offers students. The Department of Linguistics focuses on both formal and experimental models of language structure, including the study of Southwestern Native American languages and cultures, and historical linguistics. Linguistic Anthropology, as one of the four sub-disciplines within the field of anthropology, has concentrated on developing the study of language in its social context, particularly in sociolinguistics, including strong links with Cultural Anthropology. Scholars from both departments have also carried out research and fieldwork on numerous languages. The joint degree in Anthropology and Linguistics is designed for students with interests in both departments who would emerge from the program as job candidates for both linguistics and anthropology departments. Both the School of Anthropology and Department of Linguistics offer teaching assistantships and research support for students in the joint Ph.D. program. </td>

Graduates of this track will be prepared for careers in controlled environment agriculture industry, academia and government. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The CEA is an agricultural production practice for year round continuous production of nutritionally high quality foods, with crop yields that can exceed field production by as much as 10-fold, and with the potentials to utilize local renewable energy resources, and optimize water, energy, space, capital, and labor resource use efficiency well above field traditional capabilities. This production technology, can employ crop production systems, provide harvest much less dependent of season, and can generate higher crop yields, quality, safety, nutritional value, with consistency and predictability, while utilizing less land in an environmentally friendly way. There has been significant advancement in agriculture due to enhanced cultivars by plant breeding, minimized use of chemicals and effects of pests by integrated pest management, improved production quality, produce uniformity and reduced labor via automation and mechanization. These continuous advancements in production practices and technology have maintained an acceptable food quality and low cost food supply, however, resulted in more demand for highly educated and skilled employees. The controlled environment agriculture systems are integrated systems consisting of hydroponics, mechanization and automation, climate control, production management processes which demand continuous system monitoring and control. Thus, technical understanding and crop production skills are needed for specific crop needs and through understanding of plant and microclimate interactions are needed so the systems can be effectively operated and precisely controlled to improve growth, production quality, and resource use efficiency. This necessitates potential graduates to acquire technical, production, management, people, business skills. Therefore, the CEA PSM track will prepare students for rewarding employment in the controlled environment agriculture sector with technology, science and engineering, business and management oriented education and training to prepare current and future employees to meet the needs of this important industry segment to successfully compete in the global market place. </td>

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The Industrial Microbial Biotechnology (IMB) subplan of the PSM in Applied Biosciences GIDP is designed to prepare student for careers in the biotechnology industries where microorganisms are used as either tools for manufacturing chemical or biological products, or as environmental or agricultural agents. Since ancient times, microorganisms have been utilized for what we now recognize as biotechnology applications, starting with beer and wine-making, leavening dough for bread and pastries, and preserving food by pickling.&amp;nbsp; The multibillion dollar modern fermentation and biocatalytic industries that grew out of these practices produce small molecule &amp;ldquo;natural products&amp;rdquo; to be used as drugs, pesticides and fine chemicals including biodegradable plastics, and provide us with amino acids, vitamins, solvents and other industrial chemicals.&amp;nbsp; Microbial fermentation and biocatalysis (the use of microorganisms as catalysts for chemical reactions) also represent our best hopes to produce sustainable, environmentally responsible biofuels, and constitute a fast growing segment of the biotechnology industry.&amp;nbsp; Microbial fermentation is also used to produce recombinant proteins as drugs or industrial enzymes, and can be used to manufacture antibodies and nucleic acids for diagnosis and treatment of diseases.&amp;nbsp; Drug discovery in the pharmaceutical and agribusiness industries, and the development of novel or cheaper industrial chemicals and reagents are unimaginable without utilizing microbial &amp;ldquo;chemical factories&amp;rdquo;. Microorganisms are also used for environmental biotechnology applications, utilizing the unrivaled ability of microbes to biodegrade a wide variety of compounds.&amp;nbsp; Bioremediation of contaminated former industrial sites, cleanup after natural disasters like oil spills, or everyday applications like waste water treatment rely on chemical reactions catalyzed on the spot by live microorganisms.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, integrated pest management in agribusiness can take advantage of biocontrol by live microorganisms to kill or suppress microbial, insect or nematode pests in an environmentally conscious manner that does not involve toxic chemicals. The IMB track will prepare students for gainful employment in the fermentation, biocatalysis, drug discovery and manufacture, agribusiness, chemical manufacture, and environmental biotechnology industries where experts with knowledge of microbiology, microbial genetics and biochemistry are in demand.&amp;nbsp; Just like other PSMAB tracks, the IMB track involves a strong component of developing professional skills and understanding the legal and business environment of these industries, and involves a required internship in a professional biotechnology laboratory environment. &amp;nbsp; </td>

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">NOTE: The name of this subplan or track of the PSM in Applied Biosciences GIDP has been changed to: DIAGNOSTICS LABORATORY SCIENCES (DLS).&amp;nbsp; Prospective students should enroll in DLS subplan or track not MDLS. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Medical and Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences (MDLS) subplan of the PSM in Applied Biosciences GIDP is designed to prepare student for professional careers in the laboratory medicine or the biosciences surrounding in vitro devices (IVDs), a term used to describe diagnostic laboratory test methods regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Graduates will be eligible for employment in a wide variety of medical and scientific disciplines, including the diagnostics and pharmaceutical industries, bioindustry, clinical and translational research units, and government agencies. Emphasis topics may include development of laboratory management skills, acumen in the legal and business environment of laboratory medicine, compliance to federal regulations for healthcare or the diagnostic industry, or knowledge of the in vitro device processes and regulations. The track requires an internship in a medical laboratory, diagnostic or translational research environment, university compliance programs for industry-funded research, or one of the associated bioscience companies. Students will work closely with faculty in the College of Medicine&amp;rsquo;s Department of Pathology who oversee all aspects of Laboratory Medicine. These faculty direct translational research programs, collaborating with diagnostic bioindusty research partners to develop novel testing methods for disease detection, as well as basic science research programs that investigate mechanisms of disease, characterization of diseases such as cancer and infections, or disease interventions such as vaccines and antitoxins. In addition, some of the Pathology faculty also oversee hospital laboratories and clinical laboratory scientists who perform diagnostic testing in hospitals and clinics. If students are motivated toward this type of career, they may discuss options with their faculty mentors to couple their PSM degree with courses in the Clinical Laboratory Scientists (CLS) program at the University of Arizona. CLS are key members of the healthcare system who are board-certified to practice diagnostic laboratory medicine, upon which over 80% of all medical diagnoses are made. Despite their increasingly vital role in the diagnosis and prevention of disease, national predictions indicate a 10% shortfall in qualified CLS in Arizona and across the United States. As members of one of the largest industries in the US, CLS jobs are abundant, but are vacant due to nationwide shortages. Shortages are growing each year and are detrimental to healthcare and the medical diagnostics industry, which demands quality and professional accountability. Should a student pursue both ABS-PSM and CLS educational options, such certified individuals will be eligible for employment as medical laboratory professionals anywhere in the US and many countries abroad; as this expertise is a recognized, and often a legal requirement for medical testing related to human health and disease. Employment is widely available and compensation is competitive. The program also offers entry to post-other graduate degrees in laboratory medicine, medicine, and biosciences that provide opportunities for career development and management or post-graduate level jobs in healthcare and industry with attractive compensations.

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The primary objective of the Medical Microbiology and Immunology (MMI) track, one of five sub-plans of the PSM Applied Biosciences GIDP, is to instruct and prepare students for an occupation in the diverse field of biomedical sciences.&amp;nbsp; The focus in the MMI track is training students to attain a graduate level biomedical education with an emphasis on medical microbiology, immunology, and virology. The disciplines of microbiology and immunology started centuries ago with the development of the simple microscope (the 1600&amp;#39;s).&amp;nbsp; Using this new scientific tool and the seminal work by major microbiologist&amp;rsquo;s in the 1800&amp;rsquo;s, led to the vanquishing of the theory of spontaneous generation as the source of disease.&amp;nbsp; The ultimate cause of the disease was shown, using hypothesis-based scientific investigations, to be microorganisms or bacteria, and became known as &amp;ldquo;The Germ Theory&amp;rdquo; of disease.&amp;nbsp; These foundations in Medical Microbiology led to queries into how one could prevent disease by vaccination and by the use of antisera (antibody). These studies used antibodies raised against the bacterial toxins in animals. The antitoxin serum led to the use of passive immunization to protect and cure infectious diseases and vaccines against these deadly agents. This work was seminal in the development and futures discoveries in the field of immunology.&amp;nbsp; Major research and discoveries in the areas of medical microbiology and immunology have played a major part in the rapid advances in genomics, bioinformatics, and biotechnology. These technologies have also had a major impact on recent advancements in MMI. This program is unique in incorporating the MMI-biomedical science training along with the linking and integration of important knowledge from the disciplines of management, business, and law. All students in the PSM program are required to complete an internship, in our case, in the area of MMI. Students do internships with biotechnology companies based in the Tucson-Phoenix corridor, or in academic research laboratories, and obtain invaluable on-the-job training, experience, and knowledge.&amp;nbsp; This real world expertise obtained in the internship is unique and different from classroom learning or taking on-line courses. This innovative curriculum will give students the ability to take various career paths upon graduation. This could include doing research at &amp;ldquo;the bench&amp;rdquo;, to manage a laboratory at a university or in industry. With knowledge gained in business and legal fields, our trained scholars can also become involved in the business side of biomedical science.&amp;nbsp; Graduates from this track will be ready for such diverse professional vocations in the areas of: biotechnology, biomedical research, pharmaceuticals, local or national government, academic institutions, plus positions in immunologic and microbiologic biotechnology companies. The MMI subplan is working in alliance with the Certificate Program in Microbiology and Immunity (MIGCP) which is housed within the Department of Immunology.&amp;nbsp; Upon admission to the PSM-ABS MMI track, the 15 units completed by the student for the MIGCP certificate may be transferred as fulfillment of the Core Science and Science Electives Modules of the MMI subplan. </td>

The program prepares students for careers in both academic and non-academic settings. Located in the heart of the Sonoran Desert, The University of Arizona provides a unique interdisciplinary environment as well as a natural living laboratory for the study of arid and semi-arid lands. These dynamic lands encompass nearly one-third of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s total land surface and embody one-fifth of its total population. Increasing pressures on these considerable and important regions demand increased attention be given to the ecological, economic, and socio-cultural factors that affect them. ALRS is a unique interdisciplinary doctoral program aimed at addressing the complex problems of sustainability of arid lands. The breadth of research opportunities ALRS PhD program provides can be recognized through the research performed by its graduates and current students. Some of these areas include international development; famine, famine early warning systems, and food security; land use, history, change, degradation, desertification, management, and policy; sustainable agriculture and farming systems; remote sensing and spatial analysis; carbon sequestration; political-ecology of natural resources; ethnoecology and other ethno-sciences; economic and agricultural policy and development; economic botany; borderlands issues; globalization; civil conflict; and urban development as they relate to the arid and semi-arid lands of the world </td>

This program is currently open only to students doing a Bachelor of Science in Physics. This program is not open to students who have completed a Bachelor degree or an advanced degree from another institution. &amp;nbsp; Overview AMP students focus on completing undergraduate-level courses during their first three years. By December of the junior year students must submit an online application to the AMP program. Upon acceptance to the Accelerated Masters Program, students continue to fulfill undergraduate requirements during the Spring of the junior year including the required AMP course &amp;quot;PHYS436a&amp;quot;. Students then take a combination of undergraduate and graduate courses in the fourth year to complete their Bachelor of Science degree. During this time, the students also begin to develop their research ideas in preparation for graduate-level research. In the fifth and final year, students focus on graduate course work and their research-based thesis/manuscript in order to complete the requirements for the Master of Science degree.

Students obtain a B.S. in Biosystems or Systems Engineering and a M.S. in Biomedical Engineering. The M.S. is completed in one year beyond the B.S degree. General requirements for Accelerated Master&amp;#39;s Programs are set by the office of Academic Affairs, and can be found here. Most importantly, the Accelerated Master&amp;rsquo;s Program is not designed to accelerate progress towards a Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering.&amp;nbsp; The intent of the AMP is to provide students with a terminal M.S. degree that they can then use to accelerate their careers in industry or medical research institutions.&amp;nbsp; The AMP program is not a stepping-stone for obtaining a B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degree within 7 years, which is an unlikely scenario within our program. Students who are interested in a Ph.D. degree should consider the Ph.D. program rather than the AMP. Qualified students apply to the program nominally in the second semester of their junior year (i.e. with two full semesters remaining in their undergraduate program). Application deadlines are December 1st for international students and January 6th for domestic. </td>

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">Biomedical engineering is a discipline that integrates the engineering sciences with biology and medicine. The field of biomedical engineering has seen a dramatic escalation in activity over the past 20 years leading to the development of a wide variety of medical devices, medical procedures, and a basic understanding of biological processes. The University of Arizona established the Biomedical Engineering Graduate Interdisciplinary Program (GIDP) to address the increasing importance of engineering approaches in modern biomedical research and new medical technologies. The strength of our Biomedical Engineering GIDP is derived from the breadth of research activities among our interdisciplinary faculty.&amp;nbsp; Unlike traditional BME graduate programs that are contained within a single BME department, our BME GIDP is an independent program within the Graduate College of the University of Arizona.&amp;nbsp; This provides opportunities for faculty members from any department to join the BME GIDP, which greatly expands the range of interdisciplinary research within our graduate program. This allows each student the freedom to design a unique program of study to meet individual career goals. Faculty from numerous departments within the Colleges of Medicine, Engineering and Arts &amp;amp; Sciences participate in this interdisciplinary graduate program. The major research areas are Biological Imaging; Informatics and Decision Making; Musculoskeletal, Biomechanics, Robotics and Prosthetics; Biomaterials; Health and Medical Informatics Sciences; Biomedical Instrumentation; Experimental and Theoretical Studies of Small-Scale Biological Systems; Modeling, Microsensors and Simulation of Biological Systems; Neural Networks; Cardiovascular and Respiratory Mechanics and Transport; Modeling and Simulation of Health Delivery Systems. </td>

Funding comes from national, state and local agencies, public foundations, and private companies. Five of our faculty have won National Science Foundation Young Investigator Awards, and two have received American Society of Civil Engineers Huber Prizes. We also boast two ASCE Distinguished Members.&amp;nbsp; As a result, our graduate program is ranked 40th out of 141 civil engineering graduate programs in the 2017 U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report &amp;ndash; even as the second-smallest department in the top 50. &amp;nbsp; Our group of 10 research faculty produced 35 ISI journal publications in 2016. We have been accredited as a testing laboratory for fiber-reinforced polymer materials, conducting a large-scale testing regime.&amp;nbsp; The doctoral program is designed to prepare a professional engineer for senior responsibility in industry, research, or teaching. The successful candidate must demonstrate the ability to devise and execute a program of study and research, which makes a fundamentally new contribution to the chosen field. The most important aspect of the doctoral program is the dissertation, which is the evidence of this fundamental contribution. The student should be prepared for a very demanding period of study beyond the master&amp;rsquo;s degree. A minor field may be selected from architecture, chemistry, environmental engineering, geology, mathematics, mechanical engineering, materials science and engineering, mining engineering, nuclear engineering, physics, or systems engineering, or from within the Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics. Still other fields are available as minors with the approval of the head of the department.&amp;nbsp; At the option of the department, a Master of Science degree may be awarded to candidates for the Doctor of Philosophy degree who have passed the comprehensive examination, provided they write a thesis or engineering report.&amp;nbsp; </td>

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The University of Arizona&amp;#39;s Clinical &amp;amp; Translational Research (ACTR) graduate certificate program prepares interprofessional scientists for the complexities of clinical &amp;amp; translational research through high-quality didactic instruction, and mentored collaborative research experiences. The mission of the ACTR is to educate interprofessional scholars in collaborative methods and techniques for clinical and translational research, and to provide them with the tools necessary to become independent clinical researchers who will contribute to the advancement of biomedical science and the improvement of healthcare. Clinical and translational research is fundamental for prevention, treatment, diagnosis and relief of symptoms of disease in human populations. Worldwide, there is an increasing need for highly qualified clinical researchers. The ACTR graduate certificate program has a&amp;nbsp;strong track record&amp;nbsp;for training interprofessional translational clinical researchers. &amp;ldquo;I completed the program in 2004. This program changed my career for the better in all domains. First, it gave me the fundamental skill sets to become an independent investigator and start meaningful research efforts. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine an academic physician being able to progress through a career without these skills! Second, it provided the knowledge needed to become an effective learner and teacher of medicine based on current medical literature. Evidence based medicine is not easy &amp;ndash; it requires a solid understanding of biostatistical and epidemiology concepts. Most importantly, the program introduced me to an enormous number of collaborators and mentors that I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to work with. Priceless!&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Sam M. Keim, MD, MS This innovative training program integrates the knowledge and expertise of faculty and staff within the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, Arizona Health Sciences Center, and other University of Arizona departments. The interprofessional approach provides opportunities for program scholars to acquire fundamental clinical &amp;amp; translational research skills in a supportive environment. This graduate certificate program can be successfully completed through taking courses in person or online or in a hybrid fashion of online and in person course work. The complete online training program and the hybrid training program have been specially designed to increase the accessibility of ACTR to busy health professionals and distant learners. ACTR scholars may complete this program in one year (in-person) or two years (online). </td>

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">Cognitive Science is the interdisciplinary study of human mental processes. Its fundamental goal is to determine the nature of human intelligence, and to define what is required of a physical system to produce behaviors ordinarily deemed &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot;. Pursuit of typical problems (reasoning, language comprehension, visual recognition) involves the integration of disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and computer science. The Program includes a state funded research unit and awards a Ph.D. minor. Students usually enroll in the Ph.D. program of a cooperating discipline; the minor is then designed in consultation with Cognitive Science Program faculty. The Program has special strength in knowledge structure, natural language processing, and cognitive neuroscience. More than 50 faculty from 13 departments, and the following University-wide units participate in the Program: the Center for Complex Systems Study, the Cognitive Neuroscience Center, the Institute for Neurogenic Communicative Disorders, and the Neural Systems, Memory and Aging Center. More information about the Cognitive Science Program can be found at http://cogsci.web.arizona.edu/content/welcome-cognitive-science. </td>

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The CESD Certificate Program is designed to train students to effectively work at the interface between environmental science and decision making. The overall goal of the program is to help students develop into professionals who are comfortable working with both scientific and decision-making communities in a variety of capacities. Through an approach that includes course work and an internship, CESD students: Develop a foundation in the theoretical basis of the interface between science and decision making. Critically examine, evaluate, and practice methods of engagement between scientists and decision makers, including the evaluation of decision-making contexts, the role of science in informing policy, and effective approaches for communicating science to a broad range of audiences. Acquire expertise in methods and skills needed for research that incorporates science-decision making interactions, solicits and incorporates stakeholders&amp;#39; feedback, and evaluates the effectiveness of interactions, collaborations, and decision-making impacts. Because the problems and challenges that lie at the interface between science and decision making cross disciplinary boundaries, the program is designed for both physical and social science students. CESD targets students interested in serving as trusted bridges between environmental research and resource management, who have backgrounds and interests that range from geography, ecology, and geosciences to political science and planning, and more. A wide range of academic departments and programs are represented in the CESD program, including Agricultural Education, Anthropology, Communications, Geography and Development, Journalism, Management and Organizations, Public Health, Soil Water and Environmental Science, and Wildlife and Fisheries Science. The CESD program is for graduate students and professionals who have earned a bachelor&amp;#39;s degree. For additional application information, see Applying to the Program.

(See our press release for the shift to the three-year MFA here.) * Students have funding opportunities for research and travel via the departmental English Graduate Union, the Graduate and Professional Student Council, Confluence Center and the Institute of the Environment, among other organizations. * Three genres: Poetry, fiction and nonfiction, with active encouragement to work across genres. * The opportunity to apply to teach creative writing at the undergraduate level. * Excellent student-teacher ratio (11 faculty for 36 students). * An active series of visiting writers and editors. * A challenging, supportive and dynamic atmosphere in a culturally vibrant, progressive border city. * An extremely active and critically acclaimed faculty. * MFA thesis defense that may include outside readers. Past outside readers have included such writers as Jenny Boully, Gary Paul Nabhan, Steven Church, Lu&amp;iacute;s Alberto Urrea, and Kim Stanley Robinson. * The lushest desert in the world with mountains all around. The M.F.A. in Creative writing Since 1972, the University of Arizona has offered one of the preeminent MFA programs in the country for the study of creative writing. With workshops and craft seminars in fiction, creative nonfiction, and poetry, we offer intensive instruction in literary craft and the study of literature from a writer&amp;rsquo;s perspective, as well as opportunities to strengthen professional skills and flourish as a writer. The program requires three years in residence, the completion of 42 academic units, including four workshops in one genre and four craft courses. A student&amp;rsquo;s studies culminate in the production of an aesthetic statement and a thesis manuscript. The program is fully funded, with assistantships in teaching composition offered to all incoming MFA students. You have the opportunity to apply to teach creative writing in your second year. Assistantships include salary, health insurance and a complete tuition waiver. A writer engages in the world. With this in mind, we invite students to develop a course of study parallel to the page, whether it is in the University, the city of Tucson, the Sonoran desert, or beyond. You have the chance to volunteer with and/or have a for-credit internship with such organizations as the UA Poetry Center, Sonora Review, Fairy Tale Review, Diagram, New Michigan Press, The Volta, Letter Machine Editions, Edible Baja Arizona, terrain.org, Spork Press, Kore Press, Field Studies in Writing, and the poetry collective POG. The literary community here is strong. Please look into the offerings at the Poetry Center, our partner in many adventures. In addition to the Poetry Center&amp;nbsp;Readings &amp;amp; Lectures Series, the creative writing faculty curates the&amp;nbsp;UA Prose Series, which brings in four writers a year. MFA students run the Works-in-Progress&amp;nbsp;(WIP)&amp;nbsp;Reading Series, the Salon Series (conversations about the writing life between students, faculty, and others) and Infuse, a cooperative reading and art series between creative-writing and visual-arts MFA students. The University of Arizona is the home to the&amp;nbsp;Sonora Review, one of the oldest student-run literary magazines in the country. Every year, the program sends out the Look Book to agents and editors, introducing them to our current graduating class&amp;rsquo; work. For more information, please investigate our Student Guide, as well as Alumni News. And perhaps the best advertisement for the program is the work of our recent graduates. The MFA Look Book, published by the program every two years, is sent to editors, agents, influential literary people, and friends of the program each year. But you can check it out for free here. For an overview of Tucson literary happenings, see: http://www.writersbuffet.org/,&amp;nbsp;http://tucsonlit.com/, or the&amp;nbsp;Poets &amp;amp; Writers&amp;nbsp;overview of our literary city.&amp;nbsp; Check out our Facebook page or the UA MFA twitter for news.&amp;nbsp; Application deadline for Fall 2018: December 15, 2017 Ander Monson Director Sharonne Meyerson Program Assistant &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; </td>

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The Professional Science Master&amp;#39;s in Economic Geology (PSM/EG) is a post-graduate education and training program designed to provide geologists with the technical and leadership skills required by mineral industries around the globe. Candidates are usually professionals who have a Bachelor&amp;#39;s degree in Geosciences or a related field&amp;nbsp;and a job in the minerals industry but wish to obtain further education and training that will allow them to compete globally with other professionals for career-track positions leading to management opportunities. &amp;nbsp; The PSM/EG covers a broad spectrum of mining-related activities, from discovery, to production, to mine closure. This program emphasizes technical aspects but also includes essential business and management components. The program can be completed in two semesters if the student is efficient and can focus entirely on completing the degree, but flexibility is available to purse the degree over a somewhat longer period of time while working locally part time. The PSM/EG has&amp;nbsp;degree requirements that differ from those of a conventional MS degree in Geosciences. The course requirements are not identical, and the PSM/EG requires a written research report in lieu of a formal thesis. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The four emphasis areas (degree tracks) are identified below: Exploration geology: For those students interested in pursuing a career in discovering new ore deposits, generally working in teams dominated by geoscientists. Development geology: For those geologists who will be testing the feasibility of deposits, bringing newly discovered deposits into production, and expanding existing operations, typically as a member of a multi-disciplinary project team.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mining geology: For&amp;nbsp;those geologists who will be contributing to the efficient mining and processing of ore at operating mines, generally as a member of the professional staff at an operating mine. Environmental geology: For those geologists who will&amp;nbsp;be applying geologic science to&amp;nbsp;the environmental aspects of the mining industry, such as permitting new mines or monitoring and controlling water quality and supply in the vicinity of active and closed mining operations, typically as a member of an environmental team at&amp;nbsp;a mine site, a member of&amp;nbsp;a corporate environmental staff, or&amp;nbsp;an employee of an environmental consulting firm. </td>

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">For nearly 30 years, the University of Arizona Egyptian Expedition has conducted archaeological research in Egypt. This certificate will serve to increase awareness of this unique opportunity for UA and non-UA graduate students and non-degree seeking professionals. Indeed, no other college or university in the country offers such a focused graduate program specifically in Egyptian archaeology. The conduct of archaeological research varies widely from one country to another. Not only do the ancient sites differ, but each country&amp;nbsp;(or geographic discipline)&amp;nbsp;also presents fieldworkers and other researchers with its own cultural settings, standard practices, and official regulations. Thus study of the practicalities of conducting archaeological research in Egypt and Sudan, and&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Egyptological museum collections, merits its own concentrated study at the post-graduate level. For this reason, the University of Arizona is pleased to offer this post-graduate program in Egyptian archaeology. This program will aid participants in their careers by providing training and requiring demonstration of competence in the following core areas, among others: 1) archaeological field methods as used in Egypt and/or Sudan; 2) interpretation of material culture in the conditions encountered in Egypt and/or Sudan; 3) the preparation of research proposals, permit requests, and required reports; 4) the preparation of grant proposals for the conduct of archaeological research, especially fieldwork. &amp;nbsp; The graduate certificate is intended as a supplement to master&amp;#39;s and doctoral programs (be they at Arizona or elsewhere), providing a specific focus on the planning, implementation, and publication of archaeological research in Egypt, Sudan, or related museum collections. The typical participant in the certificate program will be either currently enrolled in graduate-level study in a related field (e.g., Egyptology, Near Eastern Studies, Art History, Ancient History) or have recently completed an advanced degree. Professionals in related fields are also encouraged to apply. The program is not intended as an introduction and will not accept novices. </td>

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The GIDP in Entomology and Insect Science faculty and students integrate knowledge across the&amp;nbsp;biological hierarchy from molecules to landscapes, and address questions that span the most&amp;nbsp;fundamental aspects of biology, e.g., when did the brain originate? or what maintains mutualisms?, to&amp;nbsp;addressing the environmental and health challenges posed by climate change and a rapidly increasing&amp;nbsp;human population. These challenges require innovative entomological research to address conservation&amp;nbsp;of biodiversity, and to mitigate potential increases in negative impacts of invasive species and harm&amp;nbsp;caused by insect pests and insect vectors to crops, structures, and human health. The program thus&amp;nbsp;bridges the gap between basic research, using insects as models to address general biological questions,&amp;nbsp;and applied research affecting humankind more directly. The program graduates students with a&amp;nbsp;particularly wide range of career opportunities. The Entomology and Insect Science (EIS) program offers interdisciplinary training in the biology of insects for a Master&amp;#39;s or Doctoral degree. It includes 35 faculty members representing 9 academic units. We encourage students to develop cross-disciplinary connections and bring together aspects of insect biology in unconventional ways. Our faculty and our students are collegial, collaborative, and highly productive. The EIS program is flexible in its&amp;nbsp;requirements, allowing students to design, in collaboration with faculty, programs of study tailored to&amp;nbsp;individual interests and needs. We particularly seek out creative, enthusiastic applicants who have&amp;nbsp;multidisciplinary interests, such as insect ecology&amp;ndash;plant chemistry or behavioral ecology&amp;ndash;neurobiology,&amp;nbsp;pest management&amp;ndash;spatial ecology, epidemiology of vector-borne disease&amp;ndash;climate science, to name a&amp;nbsp;very few. We encourage students to develop cross-disciplinary connections and bring together aspects&amp;nbsp;of insect biology in unconventional ways.

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The GIDP in Entomology and Insect Science faculty and students integrate knowledge across the&amp;nbsp;biological hierarchy from molecules to landscapes, and address questions that span the most&amp;nbsp;fundamental aspects of biology, e.g., when did the brain originate? or what maintains mutualisms?, to&amp;nbsp;addressing the environmental and health challenges posed by climate change and a rapidly increasing&amp;nbsp;human population. These challenges require innovative entomological research to address conservation&amp;nbsp;of biodiversity, and to mitigate potential increases in negative impacts of invasive species and harm&amp;nbsp;caused by insect pests and insect vectors to crops, structures, and human health. The program thus&amp;nbsp;bridges the gap between basic research, using insects as models to address general biological questions,&amp;nbsp;and applied research affecting humankind more directly. The program graduates students with a&amp;nbsp;particularly wide range of career opportunities. The EIS program offers interdisciplinary training in the biology of insects for a Master&amp;#39;s or Doctoral degree. It includes 35 faculty members representing 9 academic units. We encourage students to develop cross-disciplinary connections and bring together aspects of insect biology in unconventional ways. Our faculty and our students are collegial, collaborative, and highly productive. The EIS program is flexible in its&amp;nbsp;requirements, allowing students to design, in collaboration with faculty, programs of study tailored to&amp;nbsp;individual interests and needs. We particularly seek out creative, enthusiastic applicants who have&amp;nbsp;multidisciplinary interests, such as insect ecology&amp;ndash;plant chemistry or behavioral ecology&amp;ndash;neurobiology,&amp;nbsp;pest management&amp;ndash;spatial ecology, epidemiology of vector-borne disease&amp;ndash;climate science, to name a&amp;nbsp;very few. We encourage students to develop cross-disciplinary connections and bring together aspects&amp;nbsp;of insect biology in unconventional ways.

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The PhD in Epidemiology is offered by the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Epidemiology is the scientific discipline concerned with the causes and prevention of human disease. Epidemiology focuses on the occurrence of disease among human populations, considering changes within populations over time and differences among and between populations in disease risk. Epidemiologists today are involved in attempts to understand the causes and means of controlling AIDS and other infectious diseases, as well as chronic diseases including cancer and coronary heart disease. Much of our understanding of the links between sexual practices and AIDS risk, of smoking and cancer, of serum cholesterol and coronary heart disease, of obesity and mortality risk and of air pollution and chronic lung disease derives from epidemiologic studies. The PhD in Epidemiology trains individuals for careers in research and teaching in academic settings, research institutes, government agencies and industry. It has been designed for students whose careers will focus on conducting investigator-initiated and collaborative epidemiologic research. On average, the doctoral program requires approximately four to five years for completion. The first two years of this time are usually devoted to coursework, the qualifying exam, the comprehensive doctoral examinations, and development of doctoral research. The program is research oriented and centers on a major research project. At least 46 credits are required for the major (including up to 10 units of independent study), plus a minimum of 18 dissertation units (EPID 920), and at least 9 units minimum for the minor (depending on minor department requirements). Consult the course listings for further details on specific course requirements and schedules. The overall course of study will be developed by the student and the advisor and approved by the student&amp;#39;s Graduate Committee and Chair of the Epidemiology Section.

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The French MA Program provides an advanced education in French, which integrates the language, linguistics, literature and culture of France, the literatures and cultures of the French-speaking world, and the latest methodologies in the teaching of French.&amp;nbsp; The MA in French prepares students for a variety of public and private careers, including academic positions, and provides them a foundation to continue their education at the doctoral level. Our graduates have gone on to teach at public and private high schools and in community colleges and universities; others are pursuing careers in business and government agencies. Working together with the Director of Graduate Studies, their Faculty Mentors, and other professors, students have the flexibility to construct a Plan of Study that suits their individual needs and interests. The Plan of Study may include, but is not limited to, one of the following emphases: I: French Literature and Culture: Provides students a comprehensive overview of French literature and culture and prepares them to pursue work at the Ph.D. level in French. II: French Linguistics and Second Language Learning &amp;amp; Teaching: Prepares students for a career in teaching, or for continued studies at the doctoral level in interdisciplinary Ph.D. programs, such as the UA&amp;#39;s Ph.D. in Second Language Acquisition and Teaching. III: Francophone Studies: Offers three areas of emphasis (Near Eastern, African, or Caribbean), as well as the opportunity to take classes in a related discipline, such as Near Eastern Studies, Anthropology, Gender and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies, History, or Political Science. IV: Secondary Teaching Certification: Prepares students for teaching careers in high schools, includes the certification required by secondary schools. Accelerated Master&amp;#39;s Program: Offers highly qualified undergraduates at the UA the option of beginning coursework toward the M.A. during their last year of undergraduate studies, and completing the Master of Arts in their fifth year at the University. In addition, the Professional MA in French is a course of study that that combines the professional skills of the Business, Journalism, and Political Sciences disciplines with the skills of the Humanities. It allows students to complete an emphasis in one of the following areas by taking three courses in Eller College of Management, the School of Journalism, or the School of Government and Public Policy: Business Administration Management Information Systems Marketing Journalism Collaborative Governance Students normally complete the program in four semesters. Graduate Teaching Assistantships are available (except for Professional M.A. candidates who are not eligible for them) and awarded on a competitive basis, they are renewable for one year contingent on budget, satisfactory academic progress and teaching performance. GATs normally teach two courses per semester; all GATships include non-resident tuition waivers. Summer teaching positions are available at the UA and with the Arizona in Paris program. We also have a year-long exchange with Paris VII. The graduate program offers courses on French and Francophone literatures and cultures in all major areas of the French tradition as well as from the Maghreb, Near East, West and Central Africa, and the Caribbean. The department&amp;rsquo;s courses on French and Francophone literatures and cultures deal with current debates on topics that include identity, canon formation, the discipline and its history, and Francophonie, while presenting the classics in their historical and cultural contexts. The faculty employs a range of methods drawing on feminism, sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, history and postcolonial theory among others. Faculty in the department also offer graduate courses on second language acquisition, pedagogy and linguistics, and contribute to the M.A. program in French and to the interdisciplinary doctoral program in Second-Language Acquisition and Teaching. Through course work and research in French and in related disciplines students gain an extensive knowledge of literary and cultural texts, a thorough understanding of field-specific and field-related methods, criticism, and theories; and the ability to integrate that knowledge into their own research. In addition to being trained as independent critics and scholars, M.A. candidates with a GATship also undergo formal training as teachers. While the recommended deadline for Fall admission is January 15 (March 15 for the Professional M.A.), we will continue to review applications until all openings are filled. &amp;nbsp; </td>

DUAL DEGREE IN GENDER AND &amp;amp; WOMEN&amp;rsquo;S STUDIES AND THE COLLEGE OF LAW The M.A./J.D. in Gender and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies prepares students to practice law with an understanding of feminist theories, feminist and related social movements, and critical race and ethnic studies, as well as the interconnections of gender, law, public policy, and transnational economic and political processes. Students&amp;#39; understanding of feminist praxis is enriched through internships and other practice-oriented activities supervised by core GWS faculty and GWS affiliates in the Law School. The program enables students to build on these foundations while pursuing their own areas of interest by requiring them to produce an original Master&amp;#39;s paper. The MA/JD is generally a four-year program. The M.A./J.D. is generally a four-year program, although several students have accumulated enough units to graduate one semester early. A minimum of 21 units of graduate coursework in Gender and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies, plus 15 units of approved law coursework are required for the 36-unit M.A. in Gender and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies. Students may transfer up to 15 units of GWS courses and seminars toward the J.D. Students attend either Gender and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies or The College of Law their first year. The second year is spent in the alternate program. Students would then complete their requirements for both degrees throughout the third and fourth years. Courses taken in Gender and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies prior to admission to The College of Law cannot be applied to the J.D.

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">SGD also offers a Doctorate of Philosophy (Ph.D.) minor in Geography for Ph.D. students majoring in other disciplines at UA. This program consists of a minimum of 12 units of graduate coursework in geography, including a maximum of 3 units of independent study. Students considering the Ph.D. minor in geography should consult with the Director of Graduate Studies and with potential SGD committee members at an early stage about coursework and preparation for the comprehensive examination. For more information about the Ph.D. minor in geography, see the graduate program handbook. The Doctorate of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Geography is a specialized, research-oriented degree which requires a qualifying examination (waived for students who meet certain minimum requirements), at least one year of coursework (minimum of 18 credits) in addition to a Masters degree, and approximately three years of independent study and research culminating in a dissertation. Under the direction of their faculty committee and in consultation with the graduate advisor, doctoral students design an individualized program of coursework and independent study in preparation for their comprehensive examinations, which are typically taken after two years of study. Upon successful completion of the exams, the student prepares a dissertation proposal which must be approved by the faculty committee. This proposal may also form the basis for requesting external funding for research. The final requirement for the Ph.D. degree is a dissertation involving original research. During students&amp;rsquo; time in the School, they will gain an understanding of the history and core concepts of the discipline, and range of&amp;nbsp; research methodologies.&amp;nbsp; They also have opportunities to obtain&amp;nbsp; teaching experience and&amp;nbsp; training in professional skills,. Potential applicants should be sure to review these webpages and our faculty interests before applying. While some faculty have research grants and may offer students both employment and research opportunities related to those projects, the majority of students design their own Ph.D dissertation topics and are encouraged to seek their own funding for field research and writing up the results. Our students have been remarkably successful at securing funding for their dissertations. </td>

Upon completion of the certificate program, students will have knowledge and skills in the following areas: strategic planning, budgeting and finance, health care economics and policy, and advanced health care services administration. The certificate is comprised of five courses (for a total of 15 credits) and courses are offered to students on both the Tucson and Phoenix MEZCOPH campuses (NOTE: with the exception of one course, in-person attendance is required for students, so this is not an online or correspondence program). The time needed to complete the certificate requirements largely depends on a student&amp;rsquo;s existing commitments at entry to the program and especially the support the student has from his/her supervisor or employer to participate in the program. Students are strongly encouraged to secure sufficient support to complete the program within one to two years. Upon completion of the certificate, all five courses will be allowed to transfer to the Master of Public Health degree program if the student is admitted to the MPH program and the courses meet degree requirements.

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The PhD in Health Behavior Health Promotion (HBHP)&amp;nbsp;is offered by the Division of Health Promotion Sciences. The doctoral degree program in Health Behavior Health Promotion will have an emphasis on the biological, behavioral, and socio-cultural determinants of health and health behavior, and the interventions and policies aimed at improving community and population health. The PhD program includes instruction in behavioral sciences, public health practice and policy, human services, and research methods. The doctoral program will offer a diverse and challenging curriculum that addresses health behavior health promotion theory, knowledge/skills in working on health issues within the diverse communities of the Southwest US, mixed qualitative/quantitative research methods, statistics, and grant development skills. Students will further specialize in one or more areas by methodology (applicable quantitative and qualitative methods) and/or topic--examples include promoting population health equity in one or more underserved communities of the State or developing/testing theory-based healthy lifestyle promotion interventions. The requirement for entry into the PhD will be a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree. Outstanding course performance and strong evidence for research interests/aptitude in health behavior health promotion is required for all admitted students. Applicants without a prior related master&amp;rsquo;s degree will complete a Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH) in route to their PhD in Health Behavior Health Promotion. For students admitted to the PhD program without a prior related master&amp;rsquo;s degree, the MSPH develops the student&amp;rsquo;s ability to think critically, develop and execute research, while also providing depth in health behavior health promotion, epidemiology and biostatistics. These skills are essential to the success of a future PhD student and future health promotion health behavior scholar. Students are expected to complete the MSPH as a required component of this program when entering without a prior master&amp;rsquo;s degree. Except for the thesis credits, all internal MSPH coursework will apply toward the PhD provided the student received an A or B grade. The MSPH is not a stand-alone degree; students interested in graduate studies in health behavior health promotion who are uncertain of a research career focus are encouraged to discuss applying for the Master of Public Health (MPH) with section faculty and MEZCOPH&amp;rsquo;s Office of Student Services. The latter professional degree (MPH with a concentration in HBHP) affords sound preparation for the PhD program while foremost being designed as a functional terminal degree for immediate workforce entry. The doctoral program requires approximately four to five years for completion. The first two years of this time are usually devoted to coursework, the comprehensive doctoral examinations, and development of doctoral research. The program is research oriented and centers on a major research project. The overall course of study is developed by the student and the Faculty Advisor, and is approved by the student&amp;rsquo;s Graduate committee and the Chair of the Health Behavior Health Promotion Section. Students will be required to defend their dissertation through a public presentation and oral examination with their committee. Credit Hours:&amp;nbsp;For students entering&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;a master&amp;rsquo;s degree, the PhD curriculum will require a minimum of 63 credit hours (units). &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of this, 15 units are required from major courses: 3 units are required on US minority/health disparities; 3 units on advanced grant proposal development; 6 units on health promotion research content electives, &amp;nbsp;9 units of other electives, 9 units (minimum) for the minor; and 18 units for the dissertation. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A maximum of 30 units from a prior degree may be applied towards an admitted student, pending review by the student&amp;rsquo;s advisory committee.

A consideration of how developments in the political economy shape and are expressed in the restructuring of higher education settings, professions, and practices. An exploration of the international/global dimensions, issues, and agencies related to higher education, with particular attention devoted to the Americas. These distinctive characteristics go beyond individual faculty; they reflect a collective synergy and orientation of our faculty to scholarship and practice.

The life experience and perspectives of the 90-100 students enrolled here flavor our program. A high proportion of our students are accomplished professionals and we value the practical experience and organizational skills they bring. Ours is a diverse, supportive, challenging intellectual community. Over half of our students are women, over 20 percent are students of color, and over 10 percent are international students. Many are first generation students. This diversity enriches our community and work. In recognition for its commitment to diversity and inclusiveness, the Center for the Study of Higher Ed has been honored with the Peter W. Likins Inclusive Excellence Award in 2010. Faculty at the Center help foster a culture of research We are supportive of each others&amp;#39; work and that of our students. Most of our students work, yet are fully engaged intellectually in a program that emphasizes a culture of research and reflective practice. Our aim is to bring theories and findings from the academic literature to bear on professional practice in ways that enhance students&amp;#39; abilities to understand, analyze, and act within postsecondary organizations and systems. We seek students who are deeply committed to the advancement and improvement of higher education as students, practitioners, scholars, and activists. Most of our students advance into positions in various support professions and administration, but some also pursue faculty positions. Although most obtain positions on college and university campuses, we have also placed students in systemwide administration, policy agencies such as WICHE, and in private enterprise. An important contributor to our intellectual community is the Higher Education Student Organization (HESO). It sponsors formal and informal annual functions and activities that are academic, professional, and social in nature and that address student needs as well as bring students and faculty together for supportive exchange. </td>

The doctoral program integrates core courses in Higher Education, an area of concentration, and individually tailored courses of study that encourage students to undertake course-work with faculty in a variety of departments. The core course-work (Finance, Organization and Administration, History and Philosophy of Higher Education) provides a foundation enabling students to comprehend the central socio-political, cultural, organizational, and economic structures comprising and influencing American higher education. The aim within each is for students to acquire a comprehensive understanding of concepts, theoretical frameworks, issues and practices in a particular area. Such work is organized to provide a solid foundation for students&amp;#39; doctoral dissertations as well as for their particular field of professional work. In addition to the concentration, doctoral students pursue a minor. The minor may be in higher education, in some other field (e.g. the student&amp;#39;s area of master&amp;#39;s work) or split between higher education and some other department. </td>

      <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">What is HLT? Human Language Technology is a developing interdisciplinary field that encompasses most subdisciplines of linguistics, as well as computational linguistics, natural language processing, computer science, artificial intelligence, psychology, philosophy, mathematics, and statistics. Anywhere language comes in contact with information technology, or where humans need to interact with computers, language needs to be organized so that it can be handled and processed by computational means. This often requires broad knowledge not only about linguistics and how languages work, but also about computer science and related fields. Well-known topics in human language technology include web search engine technology (an instance of information retrieval), speech recognition (computer dictation), speech synthesis (computer-generated speech), optical character recognition (OCR), machine translation, electronic dictionaries, spell checking, grammar checking, word processing, computer typesetting, computer-assisted language teaching, automatic captioning on TV - in short, any and all tasks where human language and information technology meet. For a more in-depth perspective of the field, see the first chapter of Dan Jurafsky&amp;#39;s and James Martin&amp;#39;s book, Speech and Language Processing, which is available online and provides a good overview of the field. What do studies include? At the University of Arizona, our objective is to provide a balanced curriculum in linguistics, computational linguistics, and practical skills like business training. Upon completion of the program, students will have the skills required to enter a competitive workforce. We also work closely with providers of internship opportunities in the industry to assure that students receive strong hands-on experience in the form of a final project, preferably done in the industry. The minimum number of credits to be completed is 36, and students will also write a Master&amp;#39;s thesis documenting an actual completed implementation. Possible local industrial internship opportunities include Lockheed Martin (Phoenix), Intel (Chandler), Raytheon (Tucson), and Motorola (Phoenix). What kinds of jobs require knowledge of HLT? Many jobs are centered in the IT-industry where a variety of companies are in need of trained HLT professionals. But the wide coverage of the field also guarantees a wide choice of careers, some of them closer to language-related work, some closer to computer science. Human Language Technology represents the fastest growing field of language research. Because of its industrial applications, it provides far more employment opportunities than are available in traditional academic research. The Master of Science degree in HLT is designed for students who are interested in going directly into industry rather than going into academia on the PhD track. </td>

The Accelerated HLT Master&amp;#39;s Program targets advanced undergraduate students with background in programming and mathematical methods who wish to pursue a masters degree in HLT during and directly after their BA degree. Students are trained by faculty who bridge both sides of the formal linguistics and language engineering equation, and usually complete their MS in Human Language Technology one year after graduating with their BA degree. The goal of this program is to train students for HLT-related jobs in industry both in Arizona and nationwide, and more generally, to promote computational methods as skills that linguistics students will find increasingly useful in this computerized and modern world. </td>

Faculty members in both departments advise students, provide research opportunities, and teach courses for these degree programs (refer to the Faculty List below for potential advisors). Background The terrestrial water cycle includes the atmospheric component (water vapor, clouds, and precipitation), addressed by the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, and the land component (surface and subsurface runoff, infiltration, evapotranspiration, snowmelt, river flow), addressed by the Department of Hydrology and Water Resources. Hydrometeorology plays a major role in weather and climate and strongly affects human activities. Historically, the science and practice of hydrology has focused on land-related processes and has relied on prescribed atmospheric inputs (from observations or atmospheric model outputs, or through empirical estimates derived from conventional meteorological measurements). In other words, the land-generated feedbacks to the atmosphere have usually not been considered. In contrast, while the atmospheric sciences generate hydrologically-relevant forecasts, they tend to avoid dealing with the details of processes influencing feedbacks generated by the land surface. Nature and Purpose of Program The Major in Hydrometeorology provides the linkage of hydrology and atmospheric science. In establishing this linkage, it addresses the following questions: What is the science involved with the interface of water in the atmosphere and water on the ground? What are the ramifications for predictive capabilities when these processes are incorporated into coupled numerical weather and climate models? What are the new applications in water quality (and how are water quality issues linked to precipitation and related run off issues)? How is the full understanding of the hydrologic cycle from &amp;quot;white water&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;blue water&amp;quot; (from precipitation to streams to ocean to water vapor to precipitation) related to the advancements in prediction and related societal benefits that link back to the water quality issue? The purpose of the UA Hydrometeorology Program is to become the first and premier Hydrometeorology program in the World. Our mission is to: Educate students by providing them with (1) a well-rounded background in the related fields of atmospheric, hydrologic and systems sciences, (2) the tools and methods for numerical modeling, prediction and data assimilation (surface hydrology, weather and climate), and (3) the sensors, data sources and data manipulation tools, including remote-sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) Partner with various national and international weather and climate forecasting agencies to identify critical hydrometeorological knowledge gaps, to support, encourage, and facilitate research in multidisciplinary hydrometeorological science, and to work towards improved forecasts and forecast support (particularly over arid and semiarid regions, such as the Western US), and Serve the hydrometeorological science and operational communities by coordinating meetings and workshops seeking to build consensus related to hydrometeorological science and to assist in the transfer of advances in understanding into the decision-making arena. </td>

If they are accepted into this program, they can take up to&amp;nbsp;12 graduate credits in their fourth year and continue to work with the Director of Graduate Studies to ensure that all courses and requirements are met in the fifth year, including a project or thesis. The journalism MA requires 33 credits.&amp;nbsp;In the AMP, undergrads would have up to 12 journalism graduate credits at the end of their senior year (JOUR 539, JOUR 590F&amp;nbsp;or JOUR 597, JOUR 508 and JOUR 589) that would apply to that 33 and would need only 21 to complete the MA after completing their BA. Once students complete their BA degree, their status changes from undergraduate to graduate student. Students&amp;nbsp;work with the Director of Graduate Studies on needed coursework in the fifth year, plus do a thesis or professional project. AMP students may receive up to 3 units of internship credit for JOUR 593, which can be used as elective credit toward the degree.

Students interested in NAMA can either be speakers or second language learners of their language, or ones who have studied a particular Native American language and have close contact with that language community. The specialized nature of this degree focuses on indigenous languages and meeting the needs of Native American communities: due to the rapid decline in the use of heritage languages tribal communities have pressed for practical linguistic training to: revitalize, maintain, and document indigenous languages; provide skills and expertise for Native American linguists to develop teaching grammars and other educational materials; promote understanding of indigenous peoples&amp;#39; educational issues at every level of policy making; enhance and promote understanding of complex factors leading to language choice, language shift and language loss, and; work with archival media (such as audio legacy audio recordings and historical documents) to enrich the language record and to produce viable teaching materials We are also open to other community-oriented objectives and projects. Additionally, NAMA students are encouraged to participate in the life of the Linguistics Department and other university departments (Anthropology, American Indian Studies). There are many opportunities to enrich their experiences and professional network through interacting with other students, professors and researchers who have similar goals and interests &amp;ndash; there is a wealth of knowledge and experience to draw upon. Students complete the degree in one academic year plus one summer doing coursework at the American Indian Language Development Institute (AILDI). The NAMA program also often serves a stepping stone for those students who wish to advance to the Ph.D. level in linguistics or related disciplines. </td>
