        <p>This year's college graduates are strolling on into the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/salaries-soar-for-the-class-of-2017-1494581404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest average base salary in at least ten years</a>, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p>

        <p>The average starting salary for college graduates this year is up to $49,785. That's up 3 percent from last year's average starting salary.</p>
        <p>That number was calculated by Korn/Ferry International, an executive-search firm. They figured it out by analyzing over 145,000 entry-level positions, so you know it's legit.</p>
        <p>The $49,785 average salary is the highest starting salary in at least ten years.</p>
        <p>If you studied some math in college, you realize that goes back to 2007. If you studied some econ in college, you realize that was actually&nbsp;<em>before</em> the Great Recession started and effectively ruined entry-level pay for, like, everybody.</p>
        <p>This year's salaries are a massive 14 percent higher than salaries from 2007, and, yes, that accounts for inflation.</p>
        <p>It's a remarkable statistic. It's not like this year's starting salaries are good compared to the misery that was Recession-era starting salaries. They're good compared to the chill times&nbsp;<em>before</em> that.</p>

        <p>Let's get to some more numbers. But a quick PSA: These numbers will only make you feel happy if you're in the class of 2017&nbsp;<em>and</em> studied something in STEM. For everyone else, they'll probably make you question your entire existence.</p>
        <p>Starting salaries for software-development roles are $65,232. Engineers are at $63,036. Actuaries are getting $59,212 and scientists and researchers are looking at $58,773.</p>
        <p>WHEW, OK, we got through that together, friends.</p>

        <p>Graduates&nbsp;in New York and San Francisco are expected to make more than those in&nbsp;Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta...but don't worry, they'll spend it all on rent and other living expenses.</p>
        <p>If you're in the class of 2017 and haven't found a job yet, don't panic. You're not alone. Only 15 percent of graduates got job offers before graduation in a survey of 1,000 seniors Accenture did.</p>
        <h3>These stats just go to show how much income is based on luck and circumstance.</h3>
        <p>The class of 2017 didn't do anything to make them better than the graduates from the past decade (sorry 2017ers, you're not&nbsp;<em>that</em> special).</p>
        <p>They just happened to be graduating in a time when the job market is strong and the economy isn't, y'know, collapsing or rebuilding from a collapse.</p>
        <p>Class of 2017 graduates, on behalf of all us who graduated from 2007 through 2016, I just have one message:</p>
