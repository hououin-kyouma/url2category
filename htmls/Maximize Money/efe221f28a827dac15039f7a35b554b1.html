My mother got in a life changing car accident while going through a nasty divorce, and I couldn’t attend my classes. I had to withdrawal because I was unable to dedicate time to those classes during that period.</li>
            <li name="204e" id="204e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Tuition isn’t just Tuition and Emergencies Happen. </strong>You need more than just <a href="https://www.collegedata.com/cs/data/college/college_pg03_tmpl.jhtml?schoolId=1533" data-href="https://www.collegedata.com/cs/data/college/college_pg03_tmpl.jhtml?schoolId=1533" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">covering costs of tuition to go to school</a>. You need to spend astronomical amounts on required text books, supplies, and in my case parking tickets because I was always late coming from work. I also had a car accident after working until 3 AM at my bartending job and then driving to school at 6:30 AM to get to an early class. I fell asleep at the wheel and only had liability insurance. I’m happy I survived an 80 mph rollover off an embankment without injuring anyone else. But I took out a guardrail that cost me almost $10,000 to pay off and I didn’t have health insurance so the hospital bills left me freaking out as to how I’d cover them. I also had to get a beater of a car to get me to and from work and school since they were about 45 minutes a part. I had to rob Peter to pay Paul. Luckily or unluckily the private loans helped cover that.</li>
            <li name="8709" id="8709" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Private Loans. </strong>I had to take out private loans through American Education Services because we didn’t qualify for FAFSA loans (cannot go into detail on this but we most definitely qualified financially for these). These private loans prey on young, desperate college kids. Simply taking out the loan had a 10% origination fee. They charged me 10% on literally taking out the loan that factored into my overall amount. My interest rate was also greater than 10% and variable. Looking back, I cannot believe I signed that piece of paper, but I was naive and didn’t see another way to finish my education. At the time, I didn’t think dropping out was an option because I was afraid I’d never go back and become a statistic.</li>
            <li name="39c1" id="39c1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Working Full Time to Cover Living Expenses. </strong>I worked full time but 100% of that money also had to cover rent, food, transportation, and general cost of living expenses. Staying with my parents was not an option and hadn’t been for quite some time. Also, more than 40 hours of physical labor a week paired with a 15–19 hour school load in class time and an additional 10–20 hours a week of studying and completing assignments, left little time for looking for alternative methods of staying in school. This also left me with zero additional income to pay the loans while I was in school thus accruing interest over the course of my education.</li>
            <li name="2f28" id="2f28" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Entry Level Jobs in the Career Path I Chose. </strong>Starting a career in marketing and sales is not lucrative. It took several years of building my career before I could have a reasonable income. I made more bartending through school than I did in my first five years in my professional career. Looking back, I could have chosen a career path in a STEM field but I’ve always wanted to be in marketing since childhood. I was president of the marketing club in high school and loved my chosen career field that allowed me to combine my creative and analytical sides. I lived in my car, a storage unit and friends’ couches for those first few years committing life to the career path I chose.</li>
            <li name="cdbe" id="cdbe" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Deferral of Loan Payments. </strong>I graduated in 2007, the start of a very large recession and housing market crisis. Needless to say, jobs were VERY competitive as many much more qualified Americans were losing jobs left and right. I maxed out my time deferring loan payments. For my private loans, you could only defer three times for a short period of time for the life of the loan. I used up all of my deferrals not saving any for future rainy days because I felt like my life was already a hurricane. <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">When you defer, you still incur interest.</em></li>

           <p name="e2d6" id="e2d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">There are many more details contributing to the debt, but these were the big ones that left me graduating with more than $55,000 in school loans off the bat with an undergrad degree in journalism (I hear you laughing)— incurring interest and origination fees before I even got to graduation day. Which I didn’t get a cap and gown because I didn’t attend my own graduation. I didn’t have the money to purchase the outfit, and I chose to work that day instead.</p>

           <p name="e0fc" id="e0fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s just a few of the many things I did to not only make more money but change my lifestyle so I could create a mindshift toward knowing that I could crush the debt instead of accepting the debt in my life indefinitely.</p>
           <ol class="postList">
            <li name="1a2e" id="1a2e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Take off the blinders to feel uncomfortable. </strong>Confront your loans. Talk with other people who share the same stories. Look at the numbers. Analyze your interest rates. Calculate your interest rates. Look at how much money you are throwing away in interest and become so disgusted you could puke. Read about others’ plights and share your story. The more you put it out there, the more likely you are to accomplish the goals you set for yourself. Also, once you start there really is a snowball effect. I was content (or used to) paying my $800 a month and living a comfortable lifestyle for once. This is also the definition of indentured servitude. Monthly payments even at $800 were not making a difference in my overall debt. It had to be very large chunks of change so as not to incur interest. I had to figure out how to make large payments to affect principal, not just cover the interest for decades until I’m no longer able to work. I’m still angry I didn’t pull my head out of the sand sooner.</li>
            <li name="fc42" id="fc42" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Started a side business. </strong>After years of dedicating my life to my career, I realized that I had something of value to offer. An opportunity presented itself to be able to start a side business. The one thing that I’ve always had was the ability to make money. I only went to school half a day in high school, had three jobs and a hardship license. I was no stranger to knowing how to work hard. I partnered with a former co-worker and we built a business literally in a day while still working my 50 hour+ a week day job. A lot of it was figuring things out on the fly but now it’s something viable and helps not just myself, but my partner and our clients. It also keeps me fresh and helps all aspects of my career. Since October of 2015, I have worked every single day. My first day completely off where I did not look at a computer was Thanksgiving Day this year, November 24, 2016. I’m not saying that is healthy but I became so determined, I could not <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">not</em> work. Not while someone else was profiting off my and others’ interest payments.</li>
            <li name="c3f3" id="c3f3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Slept less to work more. </strong>I love love love sleep. I didn’t get a lot of it in high school and college and took advantage of making up for lost time early on when starting my career. When I slept, that eased the pain of being awake knowing I owed six figures in student loans. I could sleep 10 hours a night no problem. I’ve read some of the greatest minds could only sleep 4 hours a night and when you are awake those extra 4 hours while others sleep, you can do a lot more work making your dreams a reality in those hours while others literally just dream. I began going to bed later and waking up earlier. I would pick one day a week that I got to sleep in but otherwise, I was working every waking hour or trying to sustain myself to work longer and harder. Once you deny your body of sleep long enough, you really do get used to it. After having done a couple of 24 hour bike races, you realize just how little sleep your body actually needs to perform. Plus, this was only temporary. With an end goal in mind, I knew I would catch up on sleep later in life. Medical students in residency do it. Single moms and dads do it. Immigrants do it. Why couldn’t I?<em class="markup--em markup--li-em"> So I did.</em></li>
            <li name="4939" id="4939" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Ate less to save more. </strong>Because I stopped working out to numb the pain and to focus more on making money, I also didn’t have to eat as much. I started skipping breakfast and eating at work if they offered food. This was not starvation. Americans eat way too much as it is. This was simply changing a habit that has <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/10-benefits-of-fasting-that-will-surprise-you.html" data-href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/10-benefits-of-fasting-that-will-surprise-you.html" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">several benefits beyond saving money</a>. Plus, there is truth to the saying ‘eat like a peasant, feel like a king.’ Not eating breakfast, eating a modest lunch and cooking at home three days a week or drinking a liquid dinner (our cycling team got free juices and they are pretty calorically dense so I drank these often for dinner or lunch) not only helped me keep weight off while not exercising as much, it helped me save a considerable amount of dough. My relationship with food became one of luxury instead of necessity.</li>
            <li name="c4b8" id="c4b8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Gave up things I really cared about. </strong>A part of my identity is bicycles. My moniker is literally <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">@missbikesalot</em>. My life revolved around my career and my bicycle. And one of those things wasn’t making me a lot of money and was more a cost center. But bicycles also serve a utilitarian purpose and could actually save a lot of money — but not the way I was using it. So I stopped funneling my time into the <a href="http://nakedwomenracing.com" data-href="http://nakedwomenracing.com" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cycling team</a> that I co-founded and poured my heart and soul into for 5+ years. It was a hard decision but I knew that what we built could go on without me too by design. I’m still a part of it, but do not manage anything with the team or contribute to its growth in any way today. That was hard. It still is hard. I also stopped being obsessed with trying to be fast and fit. I live in Boulder, Colorado where everyone is pro or an aspiring pro. I am married to a pro. His sister is a pro. Today, I am slow (I never really was that fast anyway). I ride for fun, for transportation purposes and to look good naked. The bike has led me to many of my opportunities I have today and am thankful for it, including my husband, my job and some of my best friends. It will always be a part of my life but no longer my identity. Refocusing the time spent on the cycling team, I instead put that toward work for profit. Instead of training, I shifted to commuting to save money, helping me pay off debt more quickly. I didn’t give up the bike completely, I just shifted my priorities and how I got my exercise. Being out of debt eclipsed being ‘fast.’</li>
            <li name="7bbc" id="7bbc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Changed jobs and asked for raises more frequently. </strong>You don’t get what you don’t ask for. I learned this pretty early on. Last year, I changed jobs 3 times with the intention of getting a raise. I loved my place of business that I worked for and am forever indebted (in a different way) for the chance they took on me during my industry change, but also was presented with an opportunity to make more money. I could not turn that down because getting debt free became my priority. Luckily, I didn’t burn a bridge and was able to come back later. I also learned that I needed to get out of nonprofit and the outdoor industry. Those were great careers while building my brand and experience but not lucrative in the long run. I had to find a booming industry to continue the trajectory to make more money where I also didn’t have to sell my soul. I could always go back once debt free if I felt the calling.</li>
            <li name="d241" id="d241" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Skipped the wedding and the honeymoon. </strong>I was lucky enough to find a supportive partner who works as hard as I do and values that. When we decided to get married, we initially started planning a wedding. Since we both would be paying for it, after I looked at the first expense for a tent or event rental, we both immediately said F that. The amount we would have spent on a wedding would have been enough for a significant portion of the loan. We decided to forgo the wedding and honeymoon. Neither of us really celebrate holidays or have staunch traditions we adhere to. Plus the time spent planning a wedding would distract from paying off the loans. We didn’t need some expensive ceremony to make our marriage legit. We went on a lunch break to the county clerk, got married in under 20 minutes, and then we both went back to work having only spent $25. We didn’t even tell anyone until over a month later.</li>
            <li name="e575" id="e575" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Sold or traded for cash my high dollar belongings. </strong>My car with my bike inside and several precious belongings were stolen this year, and I plan to <a href="https://medium.com/@missbikesalot/mercury-retrograde-the-week-my-car-bike-computer-makeup-and-sanity-were-stolen-2dabd4e328b1" data-href="https://medium.com/@missbikesalot/mercury-retrograde-the-week-my-car-bike-computer-makeup-and-sanity-were-stolen-2dabd4e328b1" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" target="_blank">write an elaborate blog post</a> on that ordeal once the settlement is over. I was going to use the insurance check to put toward my loans and do without a car. But when my car was found minutes before I was to receive a check (funny how that works), I didn’t want to even set foot in it. After getting the repairs done — out of pocket — we listed it immediately. BTW — it is really hard to sell a car that has been stolen. Once we had it listed for about a month, we decided to trade it in on a lease and get a check cut back for the value of the car since I owned it outright. That was a big chunk of change that helped significantly. One would ask, why are you swapping debt for more debt but when you can lease or buy a car with less than 3% interest and you have an education loan that you can never file bankruptcy on at a variable interest rate that can range from 4% to greater than 10%, it is a no brainer. And if you’re a business owner, you can deduct mileage or car expenses depending on the vehicle weight. My three year lease will be paid for in full by mid 2017 as I am doubling payments on it since it’s less than what I was paying monthly for my loans. Also, my mother and grandfather had a Casita travel trailer that they never used. She gifted that to me and though I feel terrible about it, we sold it pretty quickly after. Between our hectic work schedules, we didn’t have time to use it anyway. Those two big sales helped considerably. Though that Casita was really rad.</li>
            <li name="279f" id="279f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Stopped hanging out with friends. </strong>This was hard. I consider my friends my family. But my time was limited with work and my pocketbook was tight given my new focus. Not to mention I had a husband that I barely got to see as he spends the majority of time in a city 1.5 hours away for his job. I also didn’t want to spend money or be tempted to spend money on going out. I knew this was temporary and good friends will understand. They are always there for you when you can resurface and encourage you during the difficult times. If a friend ever makes you feel guilty for not hanging out with them, they probably aren’t a good friend to begin with.</li>
            <li name="4304" id="4304" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Lived like I was that broke high school and college kid again. </strong>For some reason, I felt a sense of pride with the life I had built. It revolved around being financially sustainable and being able to afford life’s little luxuries meanwhile having this gorilla of debt on my back. It was a manageable payment that was enough to keep me out of defaulting and covering interest but not enough to make a significant dent in my total debt over the life of the loan. That’s how they getchya. I’m not saying that you should live in fear and not enjoy what life has given you or what you rightfully earned, but it can all go away in an instant. Buying yourself something can bring joy but not prolonged happiness. Instead if I were to make a purchase, I evaluated it on how long that item would bring me happiness, contribute to my life, and how much time I am going to have to spend maintaining said item. I prefer to spend my discretionary income on things that provide an experience because that is what resonates with me. Once I got over my pride — which I think was a product of not having money growing up; being made fun of for my grandmother making my clothes; my mom, brother and I living with her and my grandfather throughout my youth; memories of helping my mother search through couch cushions to scrounge up change for food and paying with food stamps; watching her in unhappy marriages to try to support us kids — I started to take pride in having just enough money to make it look like I had money. That is dangerous and embarrassing when I look back on it.</li>
            <li name="9c4f" id="9c4f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Talk to a financial advisor or read about finances as much as you can. </strong>I began talking to people who were more successful or made their careers out of handling other peoples’ money. I learned more about money and money saving/making techniques in the last year than I had in the past 30 years. The more you talk about your situation and put your pride to the side, the more facts you will have about how to use your money wisely. Don’t do it as complaining or venting (though it feels good) but to gain inspiration, knowledge or confidence in what you’re doing is the right thing. I didn’t have anyone teach me about money growing up except that we never had enough of it and Chapter 7 wasn’t referencing a book. I remember reading how to do my taxes at 15 at the library with a paper form and how to apply for college scholarships and loans on my own. I never visited a campus with a parent nor did I learn what a 401k was until I worked at a company that contributed to one. If you have kids, talk about money in beneficial ways NOW. If the thought of learning about money stresses you out, think about how less stressed you are when you go into a situation armed with knowledge. Everything new has a learning curve and induces a form of stress. Embrace it and continue to put yourself in those situations until it no longer induces a stress and move on. This is how you move from a <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/" data-href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">fixed mindset to a growth mindset</a>.</li>

           <p name="5618" id="5618" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I originally budgeted the entire year of 2016 to get out of my student loan debt. I did it in just under 9 months. It would have been sooner but because I didn’t click ‘pay off’ on my loan with AES, I incurred $7 in interest since they don’t apply your payments immediately and instead 3 days later, thus paying interest on interest again for my last payment. Ironic. It’s as if they knew I was on a mission to be done with them (they also raised my interest rates 3x in that period after not having touched them for almost 1.5 years).</p>

Since October of 2015, I have worked every single day. My first day completely off where I did not look at a computer was Thanksgiving Day this year, November 24, 2016. I’m not saying that is healthy but I became so determined, I could not not work. Not while someone else was profiting off my and others’ interest payments.","markups":[{"type":1,"start":0,"end":25},{"type":2,"start":956,"end":959}]},{"name":"c3f3","type":10,"text":"Slept less to work more.

When I slept, that eased the pain of being awake knowing I owed six figures in student loans. I could sleep 10 hours a night no problem. I’ve read some of the greatest minds could only sleep 4 hours a night and when you are awake those extra 4 hours while others sleep, you can do a lot more work making your dreams a reality in those hours while others literally just dream. I began going to bed later and waking up earlier. I would pick one day a week that I got to sleep in but otherwise, I was working every waking hour or trying to sustain myself to work longer and harder. Once you deny your body of sleep long enough, you really do get used to it. After having done a couple of 24 hour bike races, you realize just how little sleep your body actually needs to perform. Plus, this was only temporary. With an end goal in mind, I knew I would catch up on sleep later in life. Medical students in residency do it. Single moms and dads do it. Immigrants do it.

This was not starvation. Americans eat way too much as it is. This was simply changing a habit that has several benefits beyond saving money. Plus, there is truth to the saying ‘eat like a peasant, feel like a king.’ Not eating breakfast, eating a modest lunch and cooking at home three days a week or drinking a liquid dinner (our cycling team got free juices and they are pretty calorically dense so I drank these often for dinner or lunch) not only helped me keep weight off while not exercising as much, it helped me save a considerable amount of dough. My relationship with food became one of luxury instead of necessity.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":314,"end":350,"href":"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/10-benefits-of-fasting-that-will-surprise-you.html","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":1,"start":0,"end":23}]},{"name":"c4b8","type":10,"text":"Gave up things I really cared about.

And one of those things wasn’t making me a lot of money and was more a cost center. But bicycles also serve a utilitarian purpose and could actually save a lot of money — but not the way I was using it. So I stopped funneling my time into the cycling team that I co-founded and poured my heart and soul into for 5+ years. It was a hard decision but I knew that what we built could go on without me too by design. I’m still a part of it, but do not manage anything with the team or contribute to its growth in any way today. That was hard. It still is hard. I also stopped being obsessed with trying to be fast and fit. I live in Boulder, Colorado where everyone is pro or an aspiring pro. I am married to a pro. His sister is a pro. Today, I am slow (I never really was that fast anyway). I ride for fun, for transportation purposes and to look good naked. The bike has led me to many of my opportunities I have today and am thankful for it, including my husband, my job and some of my best friends. It will always be a part of my life but no longer my identity. Refocusing the time spent on the cycling team, I instead put that toward work for profit. Instead of training, I shifted to commuting to save money, helping me pay off debt more quickly. I didn’t give up the bike completely, I just shifted my priorities and how I got my exercise.

I could not turn that down because getting debt free became my priority. Luckily, I didn’t burn a bridge and was able to come back later. I also learned that I needed to get out of nonprofit and the outdoor industry. Those were great careers while building my brand and experience but not lucrative in the long run.

Since we both would be paying for it, after I looked at the first expense for a tent or event rental, we both immediately said F that. The amount we would have spent on a wedding would have been enough for a significant portion of the loan. We decided to forgo the wedding and honeymoon. Neither of us really celebrate holidays or have staunch traditions we adhere to. Plus the time spent planning a wedding would distract from paying off the loans. We didn’t need some expensive ceremony to make our marriage legit.

My car with my bike inside and several precious belongings were stolen this year, and I plan to write an elaborate blog post on that ordeal once the settlement is over. I was going to use the insurance check to put toward my loans and do without a car. But when my car was found minutes before I was to receive a check (funny how that works), I didn’t want to even set foot in it. After getting the repairs done — out of pocket — we listed it immediately. BTW — it is really hard to sell a car that has been stolen. Once we had it listed for about a month, we decided to trade it in on a lease and get a check cut back for the value of the car since I owned it outright. That was a big chunk of change that helped significantly. One would ask, why are you swapping debt for more debt but when you can lease or buy a car with less than 3% interest and you have an education loan that you can never file bankruptcy on at a variable interest rate that can range from 4% to greater than 10%, it is a no brainer. And if you’re a business owner, you can deduct mileage or car expenses depending on the vehicle weight. My three year lease will be paid for in full by mid 2017 as I am doubling payments on it since it’s less than what I was paying monthly for my loans. Also, my mother and grandfather had a Casita travel trailer that they never used. She gifted that to me and though I feel terrible about it, we sold it pretty quickly after. Between our hectic work schedules, we didn’t have time to use it anyway. Those two big sales helped considerably.

It was a manageable payment that was enough to keep me out of defaulting and covering interest but not enough to make a significant dent in my total debt over the life of the loan. That’s how they getchya. I’m not saying that you should live in fear and not enjoy what life has given you or what you rightfully earned, but it can all go away in an instant. Buying yourself something can bring joy but not prolonged happiness. Instead if I were to make a purchase, I evaluated it on how long that item would bring me happiness, contribute to my life, and how much time I am going to have to spend maintaining said item. I prefer to spend my discretionary income on things that provide an experience because that is what resonates with me. Once I got over my pride — which I think was a product of not having money growing up; being made fun of for my grandmother making my clothes; my mom, brother and I living with her and my grandfather throughout my youth; memories of helping my mother search through couch cushions to scrounge up change for food and paying with food stamps; watching her in unhappy marriages to try to support us kids — I started to take pride in having just enough money to make it look like I had money.

I learned more about money and money saving/making techniques in the last year than I had in the past 30 years. The more you talk about your situation and put your pride to the side, the more facts you will have about how to use your money wisely. Don’t do it as complaining or venting (though it feels good) but to gain inspiration, knowledge or confidence in what you’re doing is the right thing. I didn’t have anyone teach me about money growing up except that we never had enough of it and Chapter 7 wasn’t referencing a book. I remember reading how to do my taxes at 15 at the library with a paper form and how to apply for college scholarships and loans on my own. I never visited a campus with a parent nor did I learn what a 401k was until I worked at a company that contributed to one. If you have kids, talk about money in beneficial ways NOW. If the thought of learning about money stresses you out, think about how less stressed you are when you go into a situation armed with knowledge. Everything new has a learning curve and induces a form of stress. Embrace it and continue to put yourself in those situations until it no longer induces a stress and move on.
