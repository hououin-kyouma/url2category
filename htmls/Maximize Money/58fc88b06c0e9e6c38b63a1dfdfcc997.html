tml-version=\"2\" --><p><a href=\"javascript:;\"><\/a>As a Millennial paying my way through college, there are days where I dream of winning the lottery—or just chancing upon a $20 on the ground. It can be hard to say no to shopping. My wallet weeps after filling my car up with gas.<\/p><p>I constantly vacillate between&nbsp;wanting to be a spender and needing to be a saver. Ideally, when it comes to finances, we want to make decisions that make us happy and don’t hold us back. But&nbsp;the reality is that sometimes our little financial decisions make that reality a lot harder. Eating out often&nbsp;or habitual&nbsp;shopping—despite how fun these activities may be­—can add up and hurt us in the long run.<\/p><p>Most college students learn the hard way that a&nbsp;“money is no object” mindset isn't sustainable. From a college student for whom these financial lessons are still&nbsp;fresh, here are 3 tips to keep in mind when managing your finances.<\/p><h2>01. Make saving a priority.<\/h2><p>In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/my-secret-shame/476415/\">survey<\/a> conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, about half of Americans say they would have trouble paying for an emergency that costs $400. This&nbsp;shocking stat&nbsp;is indicative of&nbsp;the huge underlying issue of our society’s consumerism. Many of us are living paycheck to paycheck or&nbsp;close to it. We prioritize spending over&nbsp;saving, which can have serious repercussions, especially in the case of unforeseen circumstances.<\/p><p>When an emergency financial situation arises, saving money, even if in small amounts, and curtailing your spending can guard you against setbacks. If you hate the thought of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/01/budgeting-personal-finance-saving-tips\">setting a budget<\/a>, remember that saving up for a dream vacation—or any other goal for that matter—is empowering. Set up an automatic transfer to your savings account each month. Even if it's just $20, it's at least something to have reserved for a rainy day.<\/p><h2>02. Earning extra income is possible—and practical.<\/h2><p>No one knows better than college kids&nbsp;that creative ways of securing extra cash do exist.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modcloth.com/about-us\">Modcloth, for instance, was founded&nbsp;in a college dorm<\/a> in 2002 by high school sweethearts; now, its yearly revenue is estimated at $200 million. With digital&nbsp;innovations&nbsp;making the sharing economy possible, earning&nbsp;dough is more doable than ever. It doesn't&nbsp;require you to pick up another job or change your current one. Try one or more of the following \"odd jobs\" on <em>your<\/em>&nbsp;time:<\/p><ul><li>Freelance your artwork or homemade goods on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/\">Etsy<\/a><\/li><li>Sell your books on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/\">Ebay<\/a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/\">Amazon<\/a><\/li><li>Babysit or petsit through <a href=\"https://www.care.com/\">Care.com<\/a><\/li><li>Become a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lyft.com/\">Lyft<\/a>&nbsp;driver<\/li><li>Sell your clothes and accessories on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://poshmark.com/\">Poshmark<\/a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thredup.com/\">thredUP<\/a><\/li><li>Do bookkeeping, run errands, make a delivery, or assemble furniture for someone in your neighborhood via <a href=\"https://www.taskrabbit.com/\">TaskRabbit<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h2>03. Budget for your best self.<\/h2><p>American author and radio host Tom Bodett says, \"In school, you're taught a lesson and then given a test. In life, you're given a test that teaches you a lesson.\" And one of life's greatest tests is&nbsp;managing your personal finances&nbsp;responsibly. As with going to school, regularly \"studying\" your money and using it intentionally sets&nbsp;you&nbsp;up for success down the road.<\/p><p>Contrary to popular belief, budgeting is less about restriction and more about self empowerment. When you <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/06/financial-planning-in-your-twenties-savings-personal-finance-how-to-budget\">discipline your money habits<\/a>, you’re&nbsp;conditioning yourself to be at your best mentally, emotionally, and even physically. If a gym membership&nbsp;motivates you to live healthy, prioritize it in&nbsp;your budget. If eating out is breaking the bank and hurting your diet,&nbsp;cut back. The important thing to remember is to meet yourself where you're at.&nbsp;Even if you don't have a ton of money, you have the power to prioritize your spending habits in ways that help you be your best self&nbsp;for the long haul.<\/p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/06/budgeting-spending-less-personal-tips-saving-money\">benefits of budgeting in your twenties<\/a>—like actually <em>enjoying<\/em> your money to guiding your future housing situations—are numerous. Your future self will thank you for the dough decisions you make today. Whether you're still in college, or you graduated ten years ago (Hey, hey, class of 2007!), the time for saving, earning, and spending like a student is now.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a

             <p><a href="javascript:;"></a>As a Millennial paying my way through college, there are days where I dream of winning the lottery—or just chancing upon a $20 on the ground. It can be hard to say no to shopping. My wallet weeps after filling my car up with gas.</p>
             <p>I constantly vacillate between&nbsp;wanting to be a spender and needing to be a saver. Ideally, when it comes to finances, we want to make decisions that make us happy and don’t hold us back. But&nbsp;the reality is that sometimes our little financial decisions make that reality a lot harder. Eating out often&nbsp;or habitual&nbsp;shopping—despite how fun these activities may be­—can add up and hurt us in the long run.</p>

             <p>Most college students learn the hard way that a&nbsp;“money is no object” mindset isn't sustainable. From a college student for whom these financial lessons are still&nbsp;fresh, here are 3 tips to keep in mind when managing your finances.</p>
             <h2>01. Make saving a priority.</h2>
             <p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/my-secret-shame/476415/">survey</a> conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, about half of Americans say they would have trouble paying for an emergency that costs $400. This&nbsp;shocking stat&nbsp;is indicative of&nbsp;the huge underlying issue of our society’s consumerism. Many of us are living paycheck to paycheck or&nbsp;close to it. We prioritize spending over&nbsp;saving, which can have serious repercussions, especially in the case of unforeseen circumstances.</p>
             <p>When an emergency financial situation arises, saving money, even if in small amounts, and curtailing your spending can guard you against setbacks. If you hate the thought of&nbsp;<a href="http://verilymag.com/2016/01/budgeting-personal-finance-saving-tips">setting a budget</a>, remember that saving up for a dream vacation—or any other goal for that matter—is empowering. Set up an automatic transfer to your savings account each month. Even if it's just $20, it's at least something to have reserved for a rainy day.</p>

             <h2>02. Earning extra income is possible—and practical.</h2>
             <p>No one knows better than college kids&nbsp;that creative ways of securing extra cash do exist.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.modcloth.com/about-us">Modcloth, for instance, was founded&nbsp;in a college dorm</a> in 2002 by high school sweethearts; now, its yearly revenue is estimated at $200 million. With digital&nbsp;innovations&nbsp;making the sharing economy possible, earning&nbsp;dough is more doable than ever. It doesn't&nbsp;require you to pick up another job or change your current one.

             <h2>03. Budget for your best self.</h2>
             <p>American author and radio host Tom Bodett says, "In school, you're taught a lesson and then given a test. In life, you're given a test that teaches you a lesson." And one of life's greatest tests is&nbsp;managing your personal finances&nbsp;responsibly. As with going to school, regularly "studying" your money and using it intentionally sets&nbsp;you&nbsp;up for success down the road.</p>
             <p>Contrary to popular belief, budgeting is less about restriction and more about self empowerment. When you <a href="http://verilymag.com/2016/06/financial-planning-in-your-twenties-savings-personal-finance-how-to-budget">discipline your money habits</a>, you’re&nbsp;conditioning yourself to be at your best mentally, emotionally, and even physically. If a gym membership&nbsp;motivates you to live healthy, prioritize it in&nbsp;your budget. If eating out is breaking the bank and hurting your diet,&nbsp;cut back. The important thing to remember is to meet yourself where you're at.&nbsp;Even if you don't have a ton of money, you have the power to prioritize your spending habits in ways that help you be your best self&nbsp;for the long haul.</p>
             <p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://verilymag.com/2016/06/budgeting-spending-less-personal-tips-saving-money">benefits of budgeting in your twenties</a>—like actually <em>enjoying</em> your money to guiding your future housing situations—are numerous. Your future self will thank you for the dough decisions you make today. Whether you're still in college, or you graduated ten years ago (Hey, hey, class of 2007!), the time for saving, earning, and spending like a student is now.</p>

tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Everyone has his or her own unique way of thinking about and dealing with money.&nbsp;The Money Couple, Bethany and Scott Palmer, financial advisors and authors of <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Money-Personalities-Speaking-Same-Language/dp/B00F6GZE86\">The 5 Money Personalities: Speaking the Same Love and Money Language<\/a><\/em>, say these ideas are what make up one's&nbsp;Money Personality (they have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://themoneycouple.com/money-personality-profile/\">15-minute quiz<\/a>&nbsp;on their site to identify your primary and secondary personalities, which are both at play in how you approach your finances).<\/p><p>But even without taking the quiz, it's helpful to know how our attitude toward money can help—and more importantly, hinder—our long-term financial goals. Here's how to&nbsp;avoid the financial faux pas you're most likely to make based on your&nbsp;Money Personalities.<\/p><h2>The Saver<\/h2><p>Savers get a rush from a deal and take pride in spending less than someone else for what they want. That doesn't necessarily mean that they're cheapskates—they just like knowing that they didn't pay full price for the same trendy handbag. Your friend who only shops the sales, or your aunt who clips coupons like it's her job? They're probably Savers.<\/p><p>That impulse to save means that savers usually don’t spend impulsively—although a good deal might incentivize them—and since they’re conscientious about their spending they’re usually trustworthy with their cash. That doesn't mean that Savers are always making great holistic decisions though. Their love of a deal can still lead to unnecessary spending (I mean, who hasn't regretted an impulse \"cheap\" sale purchase?), and they may seek overly safe investments rather than focusing on growth when they should.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The biggest issue for a Saver is likely in their interpersonal relationships. Since they’re a little more anxious about money, that eye toward being responsible can also mean that Savers can be obsessed with their financial goals—at the expense of living their life, and even to the point of being cheap. If the Saver is in a relationship with someone whose <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2013/04/dr-gary-chapman-explains-the-5-love-languages\">love language is gift giving<\/a>, they may be making their partner's love tank run on empty.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>The Spender<\/h2><p>A Spender's orientation is&nbsp;geared towards making great memories and living in the moment. They get a thrill from buying something new, and if a problem arises, a trip to the store is just what they need to fix it. On the plus side, they love to show others they care through physical tokens, and love to treat others. They're your friend who always buys the group a round or comes home with something that made them think of you. That thoughtfulness and generosity make spenders wonderful to be around, and very loving!<\/p><p>Of course, there are downsides. That willingness to buy something to meet every desire, or the snap decision to grab the tab, is also at the heart of over-spending. What’s worse, because spenders often aren’t aware of their tendencies they may be surprised to see their credit card bill at the end of the month. If they don't want to face their spending, they could find themselves deep in debt, and worse, becoming defensive and lying to their partner.&nbsp;That doesn't mean Spenders are doomed to a life of debt or have to be on a tight leash, but if you're a Spender you likely will have to pause before whipping out you credit card to cover the bill <em>again<\/em>, or be intentional about picking and choosing your social life to avoid (expensive) temptations.<\/p><h2>The Risk Taker<\/h2><p>Risk Takers get excited about new ideas and possibilities. They're your friend who's always up to try something new, whether it's a far-flung vacation or the weirdest dish on the menu.&nbsp;They're entrepreneurs and visionaries. They listen to their gut and trust their intuition, and thus can move fast on seemingly good&nbsp;opportunities when they arise.<\/p><p>That excitement for the new and unknown can also be a bit of a liability. They can be blind to the red flags in a new investment scheme because they're so excited by the possible upside, and their impulsive drive for adventure can lead to spending problems if not checked with planning and adherence to a budget. Risk Takers also tend to be impatient and insensitive—they might make impulsive decisions without consulting others or disregard others' perspectives—which risks&nbsp;resentment by their friends and family.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>The Security Seeker<\/h2><p>Security Seekers are what you'd imagine of the name: careful planners who are all about feeling safe and settled. They find that security in making sure they leave no stone unturned. Your Security Seeker friend is the one who loves to research every option thoroughly before making a decision, and won't put down their credit card until they know they've already saved up enough to cover the expense. Don’t confuse their preference for the known as being boring, though. They’re up for an adventure so long as they can put a line on the budget for it!<\/p><p>The Achilles heel of the Security Seeker is giving in to their financial fears. The preference for research and planning means the Security Seeker can fall prey to researching without ever making a decision. They can also allow the what ifs of life to lead to an overly pessimistic view of their needs, stifling their sense of adventure and creativity—and their partner’s as well.<\/p><h2>The Flyer<\/h2><p>The Money Couple writes that Flyers are unusual because, \"they don’t think much about money—at all. They’re not anxious about it, they’re not consumed by it, they have absolutely no emotional <a href=\"http://themoneycouple.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/flyer_600px.png\"><\/a>response to money.\" Flyers, tend to prioritize relationships over money,&nbsp;they aren't motivated by financial incentives, and&nbsp;they're generally happy with their lives. So long as they can pay their bills, they're not all that concerned with their retirement balance.<\/p><p>While that laid-back attitude is probably good for their blood pressure, it doesn't necessarily mean that Flyers are un-materialistic. If a Flyer's other money personality is one of the more impulsive personalities, their disinterest in finances can cause big issues. Since flyers don’t worry about money, when issues come up they tend to be in reaction mode rather than being proactive. And since they just don’t really care that much, it can be a struggle to get organized to take action— and then actually follow through. This can&nbsp;result in lost tax returns, unpaid bills, and neglected retirement savings.<\/p><p><a href=\"http://verilymag.com/author/lvanderkam\">Laura Vanderkam<\/a>,<em> Verily<\/em> contributor and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-Money-World-Happiest-People/dp/1591846250?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0\">A<em>ll the Money in the World: What the Happiest People Know About Wealth<\/em><\/a>, says, “Money is a tool to build the life you want.”&nbsp;Your Money Personalities affect every aspect of your life, from your relationships with your parents, friends, and significant other to which school you attend, what job you choose, how you dress, and where you live.

tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Managing money seems like it should be easy and feel like second nature, but for many of us, it feels like an endless chore that we never manage to master. But what if good financial management weren’t about managing spreadsheets and instead more about understanding what makes <em>you<\/em>&nbsp;tick?<\/p><p>We asked personal finance experts to share their tips on pain-free ways to&nbsp;organize our money&nbsp;<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2017/04/money-problems-based-on-your-money-personalities\">based on the five money personalities<\/a>. Here are their suggestions for getting your money under control, in a way that’s right for you.<\/p><h2>01. I’m a&nbsp;<em>saver<\/em>. I wait for deals and never pay full price. How do I refrain from becoming a penny-pincher?<\/h2><p><em>Warren Hogarth,<\/em><em>&nbsp;CEO and co-founder of personal finance app <a href=\"https://empower.me/\">Empower<\/a><\/em><em>:&nbsp;<\/em>Rather than budgeting, set a <em>minimum <\/em>spending target each month. For example, next month I will spend at least $100 going out to eat. At the end of the month, give what you don't spend to your favorite charity or cause, or <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/06/budget-saving-money-stress-personal-finance-guilt-spending-money\">use it to treat yourself or your loved ones to nonessentials<\/a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://empower.me/\">Empower<\/a> provides detailed pie charts showing if you’ve hit your minimum spend target for a particular category like \"Eating Out.\" Plus, it will automatically categorize your expenses, so you don’t need to worry about guiltily flagging your spending one by one.<\/p><h2>02. I’m a <em>spender<\/em>. I enjoy treating others and myself. How do I avoid overspending while still enjoying life?<\/h2><p><em><a href=\"https://www.megscoaching.live/about-meg/\">Meg Cerney<\/a>, CPA and business strategist<\/em><em>:&nbsp;<\/em>As a former corporate CPA and now <a href=\"https://www.megscoaching.live/\">a small business owner<\/a>, I work with clients on thought coaching, aligning money spending with values, and business strategy for bootstrap entrepreneurs. The <em>best<\/em>&nbsp;tool for organizing your money based on your money personality is to align your spending with your core values. When we practice adopting thoughts like, \"I'm not going to buy that $8 latte because it's going toward starting my business or to charity,\" it helps us stay in line with what we truly want to experience or acquire in life (money is the primary way to obtain these, after all). <\/p><p>Dissect your historical relationship with money. If you've grown up thinking earning $1,000 is no different in level of effort as making $10,000 (i.e., you have an attitude of plenitude), you are more likely to be a spender. All of our past experiences with money affect our attitude towards it today, and ultimately how we typically spend. But dollar bills don't grow on trees. Work with a financial wellness consultant or life coach to uncover your values and financial goals for the year and hold you accountable to them.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>03. I’m a <em>risk taker<\/em>. I’m excited by new opportunities and tend to make money decisions on my own. How do I keep my impulses in check?<\/h2><p><em>Sisters Katie &amp; Kelly McMenamin of <a href=\"http://www.pixiesdidit.com/\">Pixies Did It: Simple Organizing Strategies for Every Personality<\/a><\/em><em>:&nbsp;<\/em>We work with clients to make their lives easier whether organizing their time, possessions, or papers.&nbsp;Clients who are big picture risk takers are never going to have an easy time saving receipts or itemizing expenses for business or tax purposes.

One of our mottos at <a href=\"http://www.pixiesdidit.com/\">Pixies Did It<\/a> is: Keep it simple. Store records for expenses in a Ziploc bag or desktop folder for any given year, and see a certified financial planner (<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/06/financial-planning-in-your-twenties-savings-personal-finance-how-to-budget\">this 25-year-old did, and it changed her life<\/a>). Risk takers may not be their accountant or CFP's favorite client, but they’ll be held accountable for impulsive spending and responsibly figuring out financial decisions best suited for their spontaneous money personality.<\/p><h2>04. I’m a <em>security seeker<\/em>. I research all my options until I find the best one. How do I combat my indecisiveness and anxiety about not having enough?<\/h2><p><em>Brett Graff, <a href=\"http://thehomeeconomist.com/\">The Home Economist<\/a>, nationally syndicated financial expert<\/em><em>:&nbsp;<\/em>Two things you need to do: First, contemplate your desired outcome, and second, take a tiny, itsy bitsy step toward it. <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/03/buying-your-first-home\">Want to save for a home down payment<\/a>?

Change your mind from being stuck to being motivated by envisioning the end result and taking the simplest, easiest first step. The next steps will feel easier than the last.<\/p><h2>05.

tml-version=\"2\" --><p>When I recently started my new job, I was paired with a mentor to show me the ropes. He taught me plenty about my new position, but he also happened to teach me something equally valuable, if a bit surprising: financial planning.<\/p><p>To 25-year-old me, financial planning was the voluntary one-hour class I took to figure out how one spends a “real person” paycheck. My high school didn’t require home economics, and my university never required any kind of financial management. The terms 401k and 403b sounded like the start of complicated passwords. Financial planning was a foreign language I had decided to put off until later—say, sometime in my thirties.<\/p><p>Then my fortysomething mentor told me how much he regretted poor financial management for two decades. At his urging, I decided to take a hard look at my finances and see a certified financial planner. Here’s why you should, too.<\/p><h2><strong>01. Money problems do not disappear.<\/strong><\/h2><p>According the <a href=\"http://www.moneyunder30.com/20-somethings-money-survey\">2015 Millennial Money Survey<\/a>, less than half of twentysomethings are saving up for retirement, and 14 percent of millennials aren't saving at all. With <a href=\"http://www.moneyunder30.com/20-somethings-money-survey\">median student loan debt at $28,000<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.moneyunder30.com/20-somethings-money-survey\">college graduate unemployment at over 7 percent<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/the-class-of-2015/\">college graduate underemployment at nearly 15 percent in 2015<\/a>, it’s understandable. We have debts to pay off, bills to cover, and basic necessities to buy. Many twenty- and thirtysomethings are living paycheck to paycheck, and planning for the future just seems too daunting. <\/p><p>Yet, as much as we millennials like to think we’re special, we’re not. Most of America is struggling too. <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/03/30/almost-half-of-americans-arent-saving-nearly-enough\">U.S. News<\/a> reports that&nbsp;18 percent of Americans aren't saving money at all. <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/24/pf/emergency-savings/\">CNN Money<\/a> reports that&nbsp;76 percent are living paycheck to paycheck, and 20 percent don't have enough of a financial cushion to last more than two weeks without a paycheck <em>across all income levels.<\/em><\/p><p>The reason is that bills don't go away with time; they <em>increase <\/em>even as our paychecks increase. As we age, we may need to make room for children, a bigger place to live, emergencies, more doctor's appointments and ER visits, and various other living costs.<\/p><p>The good news is, our ability to save isn't dependent on our income level.&nbsp;Finding a way to save $10, $20, or $100 a paycheck now sets you up for a habit to save 5, 10, or 20 percent a paycheck in the future when things (hopefully) aren’t as tight.<\/p><h2>02. It’ll help your current or future marriage.<\/h2><p><a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/01/talking-about-money-with-your-partner-relationships\">Money is often cited as a common marriage conflict<\/a>. <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1069&amp;context=fchd_facpub\">Jeffery Dew of Utah State University<\/a> discovered that married couples who argue about finances once a week are twice as likely to divorce than couples who disagreed once a month. What’s with all the fuss about money?<\/p><p>Researchers led by <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230928/\">Lauren Papp at the Couples Lab<\/a> at the University of Wisconsin study intimate relationships extensively. Unlike other conflicts between spouses, money conflicts are pervasive, more troublesome, and can remain unresolved despite repeated attempts at problem solving. In essence, money is an ever-changing problem that requires new solutions. Though financial planning involves looking at objective numbers and figures, according to Papp and colleagues, couples tend to use more negative emotional behaviors when discussing money.<\/p><p>Relationships expert&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gottman.com/research/research-faqs/\">Dr. John Gottman<\/a>&nbsp;discovered destructive behavior patterns from watching videotaped arguments between couples.&nbsp;How a couple handles conflict, whether financial or otherwise, is a large predictor of divorce. Gottman, with his researching partner and wife Julie, has found that the couples who remained happily married could identify common negative behaviors in their interactions and opt to react in a gentle, constructive manner.<\/p><p>But it's difficult to discuss money this way without proper tools and a framework. In my first sessions with my financial planner, I would get defensive almost to the verge of tears. With practice, I’ve learned to be honest with myself and my spending, and now I’m much less defensive with my financial planner. Becoming intentional about how you discuss money now can lead to more openness and constructive financial conversations with your spouse down the road. <\/p><h2><strong>03. It prepares you for the unexpected. <\/strong><\/h2><p>Working in the emergency department of a hospital, every day I see people experience the unexpected: heart attacks, stroke, accidents, life-changing&nbsp;cancer&nbsp;diagnoses. If nursing has taught me one thing, it’s to expect the unexpected.<\/p><p>As a single 25-year-old, if I die tomorrow, I don't have much financial obligation left in the world. But what about that hopeful someday when I have a husband? A mortgage? Kids? I’d feel much more insecure about their financial future without me. <\/p><p>According to my financial planner, the best time to prepare for a house and kids is <em>before <\/em>you have a house and kids. That’s why this very single 25-year-old has life insurance.&nbsp;With a great health history, it’s unlikely I’ll die in the next ten years. But if tomorrow I’m diagnosed with cancer, injured, disabled, or would otherwise be disqualified for my life insurance plan, it's not a problem. Why? Because I set it up <em>before<\/em> any of that happened. <\/p><p>It makes sense to start life insurance&nbsp;before your natural health begins to decline, because the rate can't be changed so long as you make payments. Mine will remain the inexpensive, very healthy, 25-year-old me rate for the term of my life insurance. But what if I waited until 35 and  my cholesterol levels have increased? My monthly rate would be much higher because my likelihood of death has increased with both age and poor health indicators. <\/p><p>As for making other plans to prepare you for the unexpected, an experienced financial planner can help figure out what’s best for you and your situation.<\/p><h2>04. <strong>It can improve your health.<\/strong><\/h2><p>Reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X\"><em>The Power of Habit<\/em><\/a> by Charles Duhigg, I learned the concept of keystone habits. It is a single habit that creates a domino effect of other habits. It’s the cornerstone, the base, the soil for other habits to grow. <\/p><p>Duhigg cites the research of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17032494\">Megan Oaten and Ken Cheng<\/a> of Macquarie University in Sydney. Oaten and Cheng tested gains in self-regulation by assigning volunteers to a two-month physical exercise program. Subjects who successfully completed the program also performed better on self-regulatory&nbsp;exercises. Unexpectedly, the subjects also reported a significant decrease in smoking, drinking alcohol and caffeine, and a significant increase in good habits like healthier eating, better emotional control, maintaining household chores, attending commitments, improved study habits, and monitoring spending.<\/p><p>After results from their initial study, <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487006001012\">Oaten and Cheng decided to test gains in self-regulation again<\/a>. This time, volunteers entered a four-month financial monitoring program. Those in the test group who completed the program showed similar results to the two-month exercise group: a decrease in stress and increase in good habits.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Financial planning is a keystone habit. Knowing that I spend $40 a month on the gym when I could be saving it for graduate school, for instance, motivates me to utilize my membership. Looking at my monthly cost of groceries and dining out, I’ve started buying produce that is in season and cooking more at home. I may not have Oaten and Cheng studying me, but I know financial planning has generated many other good habits in my life. It will do the same for yours.<\/p><h2><strong>05. A penny saved can become way more than a penny earned, but you have to start now. <\/strong><\/h2><p>Before I started working with a financial planner, I’d hear over and over again why it’s important to save for retirement while young.<em> \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\"<\/em> I thought, brushing it off. Then I did the math myself with a <a href=\"https://www.investor.gov/tools/calculators/compound-interest-calculator\">compound interest calculator<\/a>.<\/p><p>Let’s say at 25, you invest $100 in a retirement fund at an interest rate of 5 percent. You plan on retiring at age 65. So that $100 has forty years to collect compounded interest each year. At age 65, that $100 will have become $729.80. <\/p><p>Now let’s say at 35, you invest that same $100 in a retirement fund with the same interest rate of 5 percent. You still plan on retiring at age 65, so that $100 has thirty years to collect compounded interest each year. At age 65, you’ll have $444.02.<\/p><p>Just by putting $100 away ten years earlier, I'd gain an additional $285.78. That number got my attention. What would happen if I added just $100 more each year?<\/p><p>Not saving anything for retirement now is essentially wasting free money. Saved money accrues interest. The earlier it’s saved, the more time your earned interest starts earning interest. Even if it’s $10, $15, $20 a month, that money grows exponentially higher now than it does years down the road. <\/p><p>If your workplace matches retirement benefits, not putting in the minimum match each paycheck is also like saying no to free money. Yes, you’re $40-ish dollars out each paycheck, but your company is also&nbsp;<em>giving<\/em> you $40 each paycheck for your retirement.<\/p><p>Regardless of how tight money is today, saving even a little in a 401k or 403b now will help you out exponentially in the long haul. When you change jobs, just&nbsp;<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2014/03/finance-how-to-roll-over-your-401k\">make sure to roll it over<\/a>.<\/p><p>Taking a cold, hard look at how you save and spend your cold, hard cash is eye-opening. But financial planning is one of the best decisions I’ve made in my twenties.

A&nbsp;few&nbsp;bucks here and there can really add up—which means I can afford a vacation or a thing I’ve been wanting to buy for a while (or, fine, into my rainy day fund).&nbsp;Whatever your money goals are, saving a bit at a time is easier than you think. It just takes a little sacrifice—let’s call it a mini-sacrifice—and you can save big.<\/p><p>Here are eight mini-sacrifices that will make a big impact on your savings goal.<\/p><h2>01. Turn Down the Thermostat by 3 Degrees<\/h2><p>Turning down the heat (or the air conditioning) in your home by just 3 degrees will save you 9 percent on your utility bill, according to <em><a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2014/02/21/9-ways-to-save-on-your-utility-bill\">U.S. News Money<\/a><\/em>. \"The average utility bill for a two-bedroom apartment in the Northeast is $125 to $175, which means a simple 3-degree difference could save you $135 to $189 per year.\" When it’s cold, bundle up with layers, socks, slippers and blankets. Then think about how you can use the money you save for a warm vacation.<\/p><h2>02. Slow Down, Speed Racer<\/h2><p>Slowing down while driving can actually save you some dough every time you fill up the tank.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/driveHabits.jsp\">The US Department of Energy<\/a>&nbsp;notes that&nbsp;“each 5 mph you drive over 50 mph is like paying an additional $0.17 per gallon for gas.” If you’re guilty of speeding down the highway on the way to work (guilty!), leave earlier and slow down by 5 to 10 mph.<\/p><h2>03. Turn Off the Tap<\/h2><p>This is a rule that my dad had for my siblings when we were little, but he had good reasoning for it beyond conserving the environment. Turning off the water while brushing your teeth or rinsing dishes can&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gogreeninyourhome.com/water-conservation/how-to-save-water-brushing-teeth/\">save nearly $40<\/a> a year per person in the house. Write a little note above the sinks to remind yourself (and everyone else) to turn off the tap.<\/p><h2>04. Switch to Water<\/h2><p>Switching to drinking only water with every meal and skipping the midday juice or soda can&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.freedrinkingwater.com/water-education3/water-smart-economically.htm\">save you nearly $5 to $10<\/a> a day. Not only is it better for your wallet, but <a href=\"https://verilymag.com/2017/01/surprising-things-learned-about-sugar-past-year\">cutting out sugary beverages<\/a> in favor of hydrating with water is better for your health as well.<\/p><h2>05. Make Your Own Coffee<\/h2><p>As delicious as a custom latte made by your favorite barista is, that liquid energy is guzzling up a lot each year. A survey of American workers by Accounting Principals found that the average&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.accountingprincipals.com/employers/employer-resources/workonomix-spending-habits/\">American spends $20<\/a> on coffee a week. Instead of stopping by the café every morning, brew your own cup of joe at home and see the savings add up to $1,040 each year, depending on your coffee habit.<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"embedcode\" tml-external-id=\"\" tml-embed-src=\"<a data-pin-do=&quot;embedPin&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/99360735500167749/&quot;><\/a><script async defer src=&quot;//assets.pinterest.com/js/pinit.js&quot;><\/script>\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><h2>06. Leave Your Credit/Debit Card At Home<\/h2><p>Swiping that plastic card makes it so easy to spend. Leaving the credit card at home is a good habit to get into to avoid spending money that you don’t have. Only carry enough cash for what you planned to spend for the day, so you won’t be able to buy those few extra things that you know you don’t need.<\/p><h2>07. Take Advantage of Free Entertainment<\/h2><p>From movies in the park to music and art festivals and community sports events, there is plenty of free and enjoyable entertainment out there. Instead of spending money on bars, restaurants, and movie theaters every weekend, check your local newspaper or newsletter,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://events.fb.com/\">Facebook Events<\/a>, and <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\">Meetup<\/a> groups&nbsp;for open events happening near you. They're&nbsp;surprisingly good resources!<\/p><h2>08. Sacrifice the Speedy Shipping<\/h2><p>It may be nice to get that online purchase in two days as opposed to waiting a whole week to enjoy it, but it is a little luxury that can cut back on your spending. Unless you absolutely need your purchase by a certain time, give up the expedited shipping, yearly membership for \"free\" delivery, or adding items to your cart to make the minimum spend. Take advantage of retailers’&nbsp;offers to ship your order to your nearest store for free, share an online shopping account with family to reduce the membership fee, or calculate whether paying for shipping rather than an additional item might be a better value.<\/p><p>Making sacrifices is never the most fun thing to do, but these small sacrifices to save money are easy enough to be worth your time. Your wallet will thank you when you have a purchase that you’ve earned.<\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202500025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202500025ce","primaryImageId":"ci021601ae50002411","path":"/2017/10/small-sacrifices-you-can-make-to-save-money","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01ed7fe3b000255e"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0abb00099de"},{"$ref":"ci01df851ac000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0e790032a83"},{"$ref":"ci01ed7fe24000255d"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202500025ce"},{"$ref":"ci0209bd94b0002624"},{"$ref":"ci01defc86700099de"},{"$ref":"ci01defc897000efe2"}],"socialPopularity":0,"featuredMediaId":"ci021601ae50002411","slug":"small-sacrifices-you-can-make-to-save-money","contentNodeId":"cn0215bf24d00027bf","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2016-10-06T20:41:14Z","authorProfileId":"ci01cec0ac3000efe2","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2016-10-06T20:41:15Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01f89735400024a7","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","isNoindex":false,"title":"Katie

tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Now that Thanksgiving has come and gone, it’s time to start thinking about holiday gifts. And while picking them out is half the fun, you’re probably thinking about the hit your bank account is about to take. We feel you, lady.<\/p><p>Fortunately, this doesn’t mean that you need to skip the gifts altogether. It all comes down to forming an action plan and thinking outside the box. With these twelve easy tips, you’ll be able to form a budget—and stick to it. Playing Santa has never felt this good.  <\/p><h2>01. START EARLY.<\/h2><p>Save yourself the headache by shopping as soon as possible. And because we’re well into the holiday season, no time is better than now. Literally. Start now.<\/p><p>Think of it this way: The earlier you start, the more time you have to be picky. You can compare prices, options, and alternatives. Not only will this make you a wise shopper—and awesome gifter—but you’ll also be more aware of what you’re spending.<\/p><p>Shopping earlier also prevents last-minute panic purchases. You know the drill: When it’s close to crunch time, people tend to snag whatever is left. As a result, price tags are ignored, at least until the credit card statement arrives.<\/p><h2>02. MAKE A LIST. CHECK IT A FEW TIMES.<\/h2><p>Santa doesn’t have to be the only one making a list and checking it twice. Instead of blindly diving into a shopping spree, map out your plan with a shopping list. It doubles as a roll call, ensuring that no one is forgotten. A list also minimizes the chances of last-minute or unnecessary purchases. Basically, it’s the go-to tool for any smart shopper. <\/p><p>When you’re armed with a list, you can also hash out potential opportunities for group gifts. For example, an entire family can be gifted something shareable—a chocolate gift basket or tea assortment, for example. Young siblings can share a set of art supplies, while newlyweds can benefit from a matching set of classy mugs. By group gifting, you’ll skip the hunt for individual items, saving you time and money.<\/p><h2>03. GO PAPERLESS. <\/h2><p>Thanks to today’s digital age, you can send monetary gifts and greeting cards with a click. Because you can do it from anywhere, you can skip the trip to the store. It’s a foolproof way to save on gas money during the holiday frenzy. And while it’s a little less personal, people do actually like gift cards.<\/p><p>Websites such as <a href=\"http://www.cardpool.com/buy-gift-cards\">Cardpool<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.giftcardlab.com/e-gift-cards-gallery\">Gift Card Lab<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://www.e-giftcards.com/\">E-Gift Cards<\/a> offer discounted electronic gift cards for a variety of retailers. This is an excellent option if you’re buying gift cards for several people. It’s also useful if you want to buy different gift cards all at once. <\/p><p>Going digital doesn’t stop there. Thanks to websites such as <a href=\"http://www.bluemountain.com/\">Blue Mountain<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.123greetings.com/\">123 Greetings<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://www.americangreetings.com/ecards\">American Greetings<\/a>, you can instantly personalize and send holiday greeting cards. You’ll save money on the card and postage while doing <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/06/save-money-and-the-planet-eco-green-home-tips-life-hacks\">Mother Nature<\/a> a favor.<\/p><h2>04. USE SOCIAL MEDIA.<\/h2><p>These days, almost every retailer is on social media. This makes it easy to keep tabs on upcoming promotions and deals. You don’t need to be a social media maven to take advantage of this. Platforms such as Twitter and Instagram offer the option to receive notifications whenever a particular account posts something, so you can be on top of the announcements as soon as they pop up. Remember, even something as simple as free shipping will curb costs. Every little bit helps.<\/p><p>This technique is ideal if you have your heart set on a specific item. Check back often—your hard work will pay off.<\/p><h2>05. SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTERS.<\/h2><p>To go the extra savings mile, sign up for a retailer’s newsletter. Often, companies will send a coupon code just for signing up. If you’re lucky, you might even be able to stack a “welcome” code on top of other promotions or sale items.&nbsp;Newsletters are especially useful if you’re not the social media type. If you’re loathe to give your email out to yet another company, create a separate email address just for subscription lists.<\/p><h2>06. THINK SIMPLE.<\/h2><p>Gifts don’t have to be elaborate. It’s the thought that counts. Think of small, inexpensive gifts such as notebooks, pens, and bookmarks. When purchased in bulk, these thoughtful and useful items are cost-effective and easy to divvy up. They’re excellent for curating a gift bag full of personalized presents. <\/p><p>If you’re the crafty type, consider making batches of gifts. Opt for items that only require a few materials, such as <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/08/make-your-own-toner-diy-natural-beauty-recipe\">basic beauty products<\/a> or <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2014/10/diy-infused-salts\">infused sea salts<\/a>. Basic supplies can be purchased in bulk, stretching your dollar even further. The best part is that these types of gifts can be individually customized depending on the recipient. <\/p><p>Alternatively, check your local <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/01/style-bloggers-tips-for-successful-thrifting\">thrift store.<\/a> You’ll be surprised by the amazing “giftable” finds out there. Vintage jewelry, used books, and interesting housewares are all wonderful ideas.<\/p><h2>07. ACQUIRE A BUDGETING APP.<\/h2><p>Along with a shopping list, consider arming yourself with a budget app. This useful sidekick can play an enormous role in your holiday budget planning. Apps such as <a href=\"https://secure.budgettracker.com/login.php?sp=nouser\">BudgetTracker<\/a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fudget-budget-planner-expenses/id897849266?mt=8\">Fudget<\/a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://totalistapp.com/\">Totalist<\/a> are free and easy to use.<\/p><p>Remember, a budget app doesn’t have to be intricate in order to be effective. All it has to do is create a visual of your spending. By looking at it, you’ll get to know exactly how much you’re spending&nbsp;and where your hard-earned money is heading.<\/p><h2>08. ARM YOURSELF WITH CASH.<\/h2><p>Like apps, using cash creates a visual for your holiday spending—the old-school way. Ditching the plastic for crisp bills will show you exactly what is leaving your bank account. There’s also a better chance that you’ll pay closer attention to your purchases, lessening the opportunity for impulse buys. <\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/201001/spending-and-credit-cards\"><em>Psychology Today<\/em><\/a><em> <\/em>says that people subconsciously forget the concept of limits when using credit cards. Consumers are willing to spend twice as much on something when using plastic over cash. While it’s a scary thought, this further emphasizes the importance of a trip to the ATM. Ultimately, cash will save the day—and your budget.<\/p><h2>09. SHOP ALONE.<\/h2><p>Like eating, shopping becomes a <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/11/saving-money-social-life-finances-affordable-ways-to-socialize\">social activity<\/a> the moment someone else enters the picture. And while the company is appreciated, a shopping buddy might actually do more harm than good.<\/p><p>When you’re with someone else, you’re likely to do more browsing as you chat. And as your friend does her <em>own <\/em>holiday shopping, you’ll probably wander through stores you normally wouldn’t have. This can throw anyone off course.<\/p><p>For the most budget-friendly approach, shop by yourself. This will also give you space to focus on the task at hand. Need to give yourself an extra nudge? Schedule a dinner date or non-shopping activity later in the day. Knowing that your presence will soon be expected will help you get in and out instead of shopping the hours away. <\/p><h2>10. USE REBATES. <\/h2><p>For prime budget-planning arsenal, check out rebate websites before you even start shopping. These sites will give you cash back based on a certain percentage of your purchase. You can even plan your purchases accordingly based on the retailers and items listed. Popular ones include <a href=\"http://www.ebates.com/\">Ebates<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.cashbackholic.com/\">CashbackHolic<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://www.mrrebates.com/\">Mr. Rebates<\/a>. Some platforms require you to use a specific link, and others require proof of your receipt. Because rebate companies are separate entities from retailers, you can still use retailers’&nbsp;current promotions and coupons on top of these rebates. How’s that for spending wisely?<\/p><h2>11. GIFT A VOLUNTEER EFFORT.<\/h2><p>Help your loved ones help others by leading a group volunteer effort. While we totally encourage <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/11/spending-time-with-veterans-changed-my-life-honor-flight\">volunteering during any time of the year<\/a>, the holidays open up the perfect opportunity to reach out to others who need it most.  <\/p><p>Luckily, organizing a community service event doesn’t have to be stressful. Keep it simple and local. Contact nearby clothing drives, shelters, and soup kitchens to inquire about group opportunities. Typically, these programs will be more than thrilled to have a solid group of volunteers come in at once. <\/p><p>This type of gift is both inexpensive and productive. It’s the epitome of “a gift that keeps on giving.”&nbsp;Group volunteering is especially ideal for children and young people who are still learning the importance of community and relationships. It will double as the ultimate bonding experience for your loved ones, providing something a tangible item could never offer.<\/p><h2>12. SKIP WRAPPING PAPER.<\/h2><p>Going paperless doesn’t stop at greeting or gift cards. Instead of splurging on fancy wrapping paper and ribbons, consider using resources that you have on hand.&nbsp;Again, the key is to think simply. Newspaper is accessible, inexpensive, and gives off an edgy vibe. Brown paper bags can be cut into sheets and decorated by hand for an artsy touch. Have some old maps or damaged books whose pages you can tear out? Those can work, too. They’ll be a hit with travel-lovers and <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/10/reading-books-library-card-libraries-saving-money\">bookworms<\/a>, respectively.&nbsp;Or opt for fabric, from old clothes to inexpensive thrift store finds. Use shimmery garments for something quintessentially festive. For a cozier touch, turn to our graphic designer and photographer’s brilliant <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2013/12/cozy-sweater-gift-wrapping\">sweater gift wrapping<\/a>.<\/p><p>These options offer the perfect canvas for customization. To add cheap and easy holiday flair, bring on the paint, glitter, and stamps. If you have children, let them decorate and draw on the makeshift wrapping paper. Relatives adore this stuff.<\/p><p>Now that you’re armed with twelve budget-saving tips, you’ll be able to spend that hard-earned cash wisely. Remember, gifts don’t have to cost much to be awesome. Take the time to think carefully about each recipient and what you love about them. After all, this is what the holidays are all about.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a

tml-version=\"2\" --><p>During my last year of college, I safely tucked away some of the money I had earned into my savings account to pay for meals for my upcoming honeymoon to Iceland. We love to eat lots of great, local food, so I knew I wanted to have quite<strong> <\/strong>a bit of dough reserved for that.<\/p><p>I found, though, that despite having saved specifically for this trip, I still struggled to spend it while we were on our travels. I would tell my husband, “Let’s skip lunch so we can eat a nice dinner,” or, “We can eat this over that because it’s cheaper.”<\/p><p>My husband pointed out that my strict saving habit was interfering with my ability to enjoy the experiences we had budgeted for, and&nbsp;could&nbsp;thus afford. I was simply hoarding money, too anxious to spend it and see my bank account number drop. As financial coach Adam Hagerman <a href=\"http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2013/09/05/are-you-afraid-to-spend-money\">points out<\/a> for U.S. News, “Chronic savers seem to just have this pile of money. It's never allocated to anything.”<\/p><p>Being overly conscious and frugal with my money paralyzed me so much that I even struggled to spend it&nbsp;on necessary items. I would drive as little as possible, trying not to run down my gas tank. I would spend multiple hours in the grocery store comparing prices. A thought constantly replayed in my brain: “<em>I don’t want to spend any money, because what if I need it later<\/em>?”<\/p><p>While a sense of frugality is important, it should prevent anxiety, not cause it. It shouldn’t cause you to hate yourself for paying rent or school costs, like it did me. <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/author/lvanderkam\">Laura Vanderkam<\/a>,<em> Verily<\/em> contributor and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-Money-World-Happiest-People/dp/1591846250?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0\">A<em>ll the Money in the World: What the Happiest People Know About Wealth<\/em><\/a>, says,&nbsp;“Money is a tool to build the life you&nbsp;want.”<\/p><p>I wanted the feelings of anxiety, guilt, and self-hatred over spending to stop.&nbsp;So I started trying to view money as an instrument, not as an inhibitor. This didn’t mean I would suddenly go on shopping sprees or blow all of my money on things. But I tried to recognize that we earn money so that we can use it to survive and thrive. In her book, and in a recent interview I conducted, Vanderkam&nbsp;shared her thoughts on how to get comfortable with money rather than letting it rule our lives.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>View your bank account as just a number<\/h2><p>The root of my spending anxiety came from a feeling of worthlessness in the face of a decreasing bank account. <\/p><p>I first began to worry over spending money when I went to college and had to buy groceries on my own. What I thought was plenty to spend on groceries wasn’t nearly enough, so I ended up spending way more&nbsp;of my food budget&nbsp;than I had anticipated. It made my pulse skyrocket.<\/p><p>“For all the obsession regarding our net worth, most of us fail to consider our decisions rationally, and in the end we succumb to one, essentially universal, basic financial assumption: there is never enough,” writes Vanderkam.<\/p><p>Money is of no value if all it does is collect dust. The purpose of money is to afford services and purchases that enable us to live with dignity. Even my savings account will eventually go toward sustaining my life, either in an emergency or in retirement. I had to remind myself that the number in my account doesn’t define how much I “have” or am worth. We all have much more than&nbsp;money: family, friendships, and personal&nbsp;fulfillment. <\/p><h2>Don't just save for your future<\/h2><p>When I was growing up, my parents would give me an allowance every month and tell me to save ten percent of it. It was a great habit to start. But while in college, I learned that saving money without a specific goal or purpose is hard. Why should I put my money in a savings account if I’m not saving it for anything? This was way before retirement even crossed my mind. <\/p><p>Then, once I understood that saving money meant building one’s future and security, I stuck to that goal religiously. My savings account was for nothing else. “Many of us want to save money and build up assets, and that’s a good thing,” says Vanderkam. “But like any emotion you can take that too far.”<\/p><p>I realized that having more than one account would be necessary for me. After saving money for our future and living expenses, I also started saving some money for something I knew I wanted to have or do. Currently, this means setting aside extra money my husband and I make for a trip to Montreal. <\/p><p>“You need to be clear on what your values are,” says Vanderkam. “It’s very easy to spend money mindlessly, which can trigger bad feelings about it.” She points out that eliminating spending on smaller things you don’t really care about can lead to saving that money, bundling it, and spending it on something bigger that you do care for and value. <\/p><h2>Give yourself permission to spend money on small non-essentials<\/h2><p>Apart from saving my money for something big that I want, I’ve also begun to allocate money into a day-to-day “fun” account.<\/p><p>To lose the guilt that came with spending money, I needed to know how much I could use on non-essential items. Just like having a fixed amount of money set aside for expenses like rent, groceries, and gas every month, I started to set aside a small budget for things I enjoy, such as calligraphy pens, coconut milk iced lattes, and an occasional new shirt from my favorite clothing brand. With this new habit, I knew the money was meant for these “nice-to-have” items, so I didn’t feel bad when I spent it on them.<\/p><p>“Be clear on what does matter to you and seems really awesome to you,” says Vanderkam. “Maybe it’s something like traveling, or you have a certain business you’d like to start, or you’re very happy when you have lovely stationery. No judgements here.” Despite all the advice out there on how to properly divvy up your income, no one here is saying that you have to spend money a certain way.<\/p><p>If you are worried about having enough money to spend on non-essentials, Vanderkam suggests finding a “side hustle” (like one of these ideas for ways to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/08/earning-extra-money-second-job-paying-off-college-debt-make-money-from-your-hobby\">earn money on the side<\/a>&nbsp;by doing something you love).&nbsp;“It could be that you sell stuff on Etsy or you babysit your neighbor’s kids on Saturdays,” she advises. “And you could consciously say that the money that doesn’t go to taxes from that is fun money.”<\/p><h2>Spend your money where it holds more value<\/h2><p>One reason I experienced anxiety when it came to spending was that what I was purchasing was not as fulfilling as I thought it would be. Science agrees. One study published in <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/319/5870/1687\"><em>Science<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;finds that “participants who were randomly assigned to spend money on others experienced greater happiness than those assigned to spend money on themselves.”<\/p><p>One way I eliminated anxiety over spending was to value using it for <a href=\"http://www.fastcoexist.com/3043858/world-changing-ideas/the-science-of-why-you-should-spend-your-money-on-experiences-not-thing\">experiences<\/a> over things. When we went to Iceland, I wish I had realized that it wasn’t just the food that I was spending my money on, but the <em>experience<\/em> behind trying new and exciting cuisines that I had never seen or heard of before. Now when I go to the movies, I don’t view it as blowing $25, but as enjoying a special date night with my husband. Thankfully, our budget enables us to enjoy these experiences without feeling uneasy.<\/p><p>A research study in the <a href=\"http://web.a.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=15277143&amp;AN=23452898&amp;h=eavhZXeo9zzIesGAiGi2wMQo%2brhytMutuZLoYvlXy6ttLH1%2b5Ckfd4cQUUgr0nP2SwX6WQfK4NT13v6SXNiJmg%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d15277143%26AN%3d23452898\">North American Journal of Psychology<\/a> reports that being less materialistic and freer with how we spend our money is proven to expand our openness to new experiences. “Experiences are less subjective to comparison,” says Vanderkam. “That lack of comparison allows us to draw more pleasure from experiences.”<\/p><p>The next time you feel anxious about spending money, ask yourself if the experience is worth it to you. If you’re thinking about buying a $100 dress, for instance, ask, “Am I willing to pay $5 to <em>experience<\/em> wearing this dress at least 20 times this year?”<\/p><p>If you still feel spending anxiety, “start by choosing something you’ve always wanted to do that has a reasonable price tag and get a friend to do it with you,” says Vanderkam. That way, you learn to spend your money on an experience that matters to you while also fulfilling your social needs.<\/p><p>I now feel confident when I spend my money because I know I’m saving for the future and taking care of my basic needs. And I know how to maximize the rest of it in a way that works best for our lifestyle.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"http://www.corynneolivia.co/\">Corynne Olivia<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202500025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202500025ce","primaryImageId":"ci01ef5710f00124a4","path":"/2016/06/budget-saving-money-stress-personal-finance-guilt-spending-money","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01ed7fe3b000255e"},{"$ref":"ci01ed7fe24000255d"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0d32006c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01defc897000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01df8871900099de"},{"$ref":"ci01e14bd26000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0dcf0019512"},{"$ref":"ci01df851ac000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202500025ce"},{"$ref":"ci01cec0b21000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01cfa20eb0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01d94bbbe00099de"}],"socialPopularity":85,"featuredMediaId":"ci01ef5710f00124a4","slug":"budget-saving-money-stress-personal-finance-guilt-spending-money","contentNodeId":"cn01eedeb58000275e","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2016-04-13T16:48:15Z","publicationTimestamp":"2016-04-13T16:48:15Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01e996627000269e","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","isNoindex":false,"title":"Sarah Reynolds","slug":"sarah-reynolds","disqusId":"39affbd3-fcf0-11e5-8386-02ddd230d66b","bio":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Sarah Reynolds is a Lifestyle editorial intern for <em>Verily<\/em>.<\/p>","path":"/author/sarah-reynolds"},"teaser":"There is such a thing as being too frugal.","promoTitle":"4 Steps to Have a Healthier Attitude Towards Spending Money","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":-3.93633e-28,"velocity":0,"estimate":8.13422,"lastCount":6},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":1.46102,"lastCount":1},"facebook":{"acceleration":-1.06815e-13,"velocity":4.18453e-20,"estimate":84.7354,"lastCount":78},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0}},"dek":"There is such a thing as being too frugal.","featuredMedia":{"$ref":"ci01ef5710f00124a4"},"ownerId":null},{"isPromoted":false,"authorProfileId":"ci01d8b1be100099de","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2016-06-01T09:00:00Z","sectionIds":[["ci020b7202500025ce"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01ed228770002782","objectType":"ContentArticle","terms":[{"$ref":"ci01df48c110009512"},{"$ref":"ci01e948040000269f"},{"$ref":"ci01e21ec930009512"},{"$ref":"ci01da56a2100099de"},{"publicationTimestamp":"2015-12-01T20:55:00Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01df0c5a30002a83","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Real Women","vocabularyId":"cs01cb70fb90009512:terms","editedTimestamp":"2015-12-01T20:54:59Z","disqusId":"c8ea04b0-986d-11e5-b05a-00221960550f","path":"/tag/real-women/","slug":"real-women","displayName":"Real Women","promoTitle":"Real Women"},{"$ref":"ci01defc897000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01ed7fe3b000255e"},{"$ref":"ci01df851ac000efe2"}],"isNoindex":false,"title":"7 Things You Need to Know About Budgeting in Your Twenties","primaryImage":{"height":427,"cloudinaryVersionId":1464472530,"defaultCaption":"","id":"ci01edcd053001243b","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"mariam-sitchinava-21.jpg","primaryPhotoId":"ci01edcd053001243b","width":640,"publicId":"MTM4OTkyNTg0ODc2ODkzNjg2","format":"jpg","bytes":50734},"isSponsored":false,"editedTimestamp":"2016-06-01T10:08:55Z","disqusId":"f69d636c-1ec4-11e6-ae53-02eeea8de379","autoSaved":false,"tmlEmbeds":[],"sectionsLeafNode":["ci020b7202500025ce"],"bodyTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>When I began earning a post-grad paycheck, I assumed that managing my money would come naturally. My income wasn’t grand, but it was a definite step up from my part-time jobs as a barista and student researcher.<\/p><p>A few years into budgeting, I feel like I’m finally in a groove, but it proved to be a challenge for me—and my post-grad friends.&nbsp;I interviewed a few millennials with several years of “adulting” under their belts. Here are seven things we all wish we had learned sooner that would’ve definitely paid off.<\/p><h2>01. Saving a little bit every paycheck adds up.<\/h2><p>When <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/01/budgeting-personal-finance-saving-tips\">beginning a budget<\/a>, it’s difficult to know where to start, especially out of college where you’re likely hit with new expenses like insurance, security deposits, and an needing to build an emergency fund.<\/p><p>Christine Romans, CNN chief business correspondent, explains in her book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Smart-New-Rich-Cant-Afford/dp/0470642068\"><em>Smart is the New Rich: If You Can't Afford It, Put It Down<\/em><\/a>: “Throughout human history, civilizations endured because they planned for the future by socking away a little of today’s wealth for the next year. They saved some of this year’s crop to plant again the next year to guarantee stability (and wealth) for coming year.”&nbsp;<\/p><p>Mary Claire—an art educator at a museum—started budgeting by simply putting away a small portion of her take-home pay into a savings account.<\/p><p>“I wish I realized how fast you can start saving money by taking a little from every paycheck,” she said. Setting aside just $75 each month, for instance, adds up to $1,800 in two years. Raise that to $100 a month, and you’ll be sitting on $3,600 just three years from now. Say hello to that dream vacation!<\/p><h2>02. A budget helps you enjoy your money.<\/h2><p>In college, Taryn carefully watched her money and opted for budget-savvy entertainment options like movies and games in a friend’s dorm instead of going to a movie theater. Although she graduated debt-free with some savings, she realized that her approach to money was driven by fear.&nbsp;Now that she is employed full-time as a mechanical engineer, she’s learning to enjoy what she earns while being frugal.&nbsp;<\/p><p>“I’m realizing it's okay to go out for a nice meal, especially when that's the most natural form of fellowship and spending time with friends,” she says. But a budget helps balance her dining out spending.&nbsp;“The weeks that we don't make time for grocery shopping, we probably spend 3 times more on lunch and dinner eating out, and by the end of the week we feel horribly unhealthy,” Taryn adds.<\/p><p>Abby, an OB nurse, says that budgeting has allowed her to not worry about purchases because she knows when she can afford it.&nbsp;“The cool thing about budgeting that I didn’t realize until recently is that if I plan ahead for big purchases (like a fancy dinner out with my husband), I don't have to feel guilty about spending a lot of money,” she says. “It’s fun to put aside money for something special. Budgeting lets me go out for dinner and not think twice about splurging on wine and dessert.”<\/p><h2>03. It gives you a guideline to choose your housing situation wisely.<\/h2><p>When beginning your first job, it’s easy to look at your paycheck and get carried away by the new lifestyle you can afford.<\/p><p>“You have your first offer letter in your hand, you divide your salary by 12 and think, ‘Wow, I can afford to live in a really nice place now,’” explains Taryn. “You don't think about federal taxes, state taxes, health insurance, car insurance, etc. which, sadly, significantly reduces your monthly take home pay.”<\/p><p>Although 30 percent is often a standard given for how much of your income should go toward housing, Bloomberg reports that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-17/housings-30-percent-of-income-rule-is-near-useless\">recent data is showing that more and more people are spending much more than that<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Financial guru Dave Ramsey <a href=\"http://www.daveramsey.com/blog/how-much-house-can-you-afford/\">explains that there is no one perfect formula <\/a>for how much a person should spend on a home. “There is no magic dollar amount for the ‘perfect home,’” he writes. “How much house you can afford is as unique as you are and is based on many factors—your location, income, savings, personal preferences.”<\/p><p>The goal with all expenses, but especially with housing, is to make sure your living situation enables you to live the life you want rather than one that is frustrating or burdens you.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>04. Find a mentor or professional adviser.<\/h2><p>When talking with friends, it’s easy to feel like you’re the only one who doesn’t know what you’re doing with your money. How can your peers on Instagram afford daily lattes, the latest J.Crew pieces, and a trip to Europe?<\/p><p>“I felt really alone in my struggles to budget and make wise financial choices right after college,” says Katie, an elementary school speech therapist. “Once I started talking to my friends about it, I realized they were pretty much asking the same questions. We were all just trying to learn.”<\/p><p>Talk with those you trust, like your parents or friends, about your budget and ask for advice or tips on what they do to successfully manage their own. Create an accountability group with your friends to talk about your budgets. Meet with a financial adviser or banker to learn about different savings accounts and other ways to make your goals like home ownership or a big trip happen. Whatever you do, don't ignore your finances. That's never a good option.<\/p><h2>05. Let your budget fit your needs.<\/h2><p>Like Abby, Liz is a nurse who has let her budget evolve as she’s learned more about herself and what she values, even if that means going without luxuries that her peers consider necessities.<\/p><p>“After college it was hard for me to feel good about spending money on certain things that I enjoy. I've realized over time that it's ok to spend more on what I enjoy if I'm willing to skimp in another category,” she says. “Eating good food is important to me, so I spend a little more on groceries. Watching TV is not a priority, so I don't spend money on a cable plan or Netflix.”<\/p><p>Take a personal assessment of your priorities. You might find that you're actually spending a lot of money on something you don't care as much about. Do you actually see a big difference in the high-dollar mascara from Sephora, or could you switch to a drugstore brand and use the extra $20 for something else?<\/p><h2>06. Find a system that works for you.<\/h2><p>One of my biggest struggles with budgeting was taking my well-laid plan and making it a reality in my life. Through conversations with friends, I’ve realized that how everyone creates and executes their budget is as different and unique as their personalities.<\/p><p>Katie decided to make simple rules for herself to help her reign in spending.&nbsp;“Maybe it's the teacher in me, but making up rules seems to work well for me. I never buy coffee at a café unless I am going to drink it in the company of a friend,” she says. “I only grocery shop once a week. If I run out of something halfway through the week, I just have to live without it. Little rules like these keep me from impulse buying a rotisserie chicken on my way home from work.”<\/p><p>Budgeting has also helped Abby and her husband navigate differences they have regarding money. They both value generosity, but approach opportunities to give differently.&nbsp;“We have a line item on our budget every month for money that we want to give to or spend on others, whether that’s buying dinner for a friend or helping someone in our community buy groceries,” Abby says. \"Our budget has given us a boundary that we agree on and lets us give confidently.\"<\/p><p>Liz said that working out a budget took some time, but it was worth the effort.&nbsp;“The first year, I was way off on what I thought I would spend on certain items, both over- and under-budgeting.  However, by having a budget, I can at least see where my money is going so I can track it and make my budget a little bit more accurate each year.”<\/p><h2>07. It pays off.<\/h2><p>Regardless of family situation and salary, budgeting is for everyone. It is a way to tell your money where to go versus coming to the end of a day, month, or year asking where your money went.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Abby was able to decorate her new apartment and enjoy trips using rewards from her credit card (which she uses like a debit card) without going into debt. Budgeting gave Taryn and her husband the ability to buy a car when they needed to. And because of our consistent (though imperfect!) budgeting efforts over the past three years, my husband and I were able to <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/03/buying-your-first-home\">purchase a home last fall<\/a>. <\/p><p>Navigating the early stages of managing your own money can be tenuous. But if you put in the effort, you’ll reap the benefits for years to come.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"http://mariam.ge/\">Mariam Sitchinava<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b7202500025ce"],"primarySectionLeafNode":"ci020b7202500025ce","primaryImageId":"ci01edcd053001243b","path":"/2016/06/budgeting-spending-less-personal-tips-saving-money","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01df48c110009512"},{"$ref":"ci01e948040000269f"},{"$ref":"ci01e21ec930009512"},{"$ref":"ci01da56a2100099de"},{"$ref":"ci020b7202500025ce"},{"$ref":"ci01df0c5a30002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01defc897000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01ed7fe3b000255e"},{"$ref":"ci01df851ac000efe2"}],"socialPopularity":159,"featuredMediaId":"ci01edcd053001243b","slug":"budgeting-spending-less-personal-tips-saving-money","contentNodeId":"cn01ed228770002782","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2015-09-29T13:48:48Z","pinterestProfileUrl":"https://www.pinterest.com/abigailmurrish/","publicationTimestamp":"2015-09-29T13:48:48Z","id":"ci01d8b1be100099de","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","title":"Abigail Murrish","slug":"amurrish","instagramProfileUrl":"https://instagram.com/abigailmurrish/","disqusId":"88327122-66eb-11e5-be2e-0022195fd05d","twitterUsername":"abigailmurrish","website":"http://abigailmurrish.com/","bio":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Abigail Murrish is an agricultural writer passionate about encouraging people to know their food, eat well, and show hospitality.

This is especially true when it comes to finances, a topic that makes most people cringe.<\/p><p>Sure, dealing with finances is intimidating and scary. We get it. But the sooner you get a grasp on your hard-earned cash, the less stress you’ll have later on. It starts with small changes—all of which you can start this year.<\/p><p>We turned to <a href=\"http://www.mfinancialplanningservices.com/team/catherine-b-allen-cfp\">Catherine B. Allen<\/a>, a certified financial planner in New Jersey, to give us the lowdown. While learning to <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/06/financial-planning-in-your-twenties-savings-personal-finance-how-to-budget\">be financially smart<\/a> is a lifelong practice, she explains how these ten goals can point you in the right direction.<\/p><h2>01. Be specific.<\/h2><p>Like most things in life, the most successful goals start with the details. Simply thinking “I want to spend less and save more!” isn’t enough. Sure, it’s great—but it’s also vague. Instead, Allen suggests focusing on specific, action-oriented goals. “Try eating out only once a week or paying off a credit card,” she says. This way, you can work toward one financial goal that has visible results.<\/p><h2>02. Build a budget.<\/h2><p>It might sound boring, but it’s totally necessary. “Your savings won’t be really strong without a good budget,”&nbsp;Allen says. “It’s like your core—your workout will not be really effective unless your core is strong.” And while it might seem daunting, there are so many useful resources out there. Allen suggests using a personal finance app like <a href=\"http://wally.me/\">Wally<\/a> or <a href=\"https://www.levelmoney.com/\">Level Money<\/a>. Your bank might even offer one.<\/p><h2>03. Start an emergency fund.<\/h2><p>Life is unpredictable and crazy. “Be kind to your ‘future self under stress’ and have a savings cushion,” Allen advises. She reminds us that you never know when you’ll get laid off or when your car or laptop will break down. While we can cross our fingers and hope for the best, you just never know. Act accordingly. Setting aside just $20 a week&nbsp;means you'll have $1,040 saved up in&nbsp;one year.<\/p><h2>04. Mind your credit.<\/h2><p>From renting an apartment to buying a car, your credit score can make or break big life decisions. Allen suggests checking your credit score and learning what everything means. “You can pull your credit report from each of the three U.S. credit bureaus—Equifax, Experian, and&nbsp;TransUnion—for free once a year,” she says. “Pick a date and visit <a href=\"http://annualcreditreport.com\">annualcreditreport.com<\/a> and pull your report.” Go through them carefully and look for mistakes like duplicate accounts or accounts listed as closed. If your credit score is not-so-great? Research <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/moneybuilder/2014/05/02/11-ways-to-raise-your-credit-score-fast/#6aa85db17162\">ways to bump up that number<\/a>, like getting a credit card, increasing your credit limit, or paying your bills twice a month.<\/p><h2>05. Deal with debt.<\/h2><p>The longer you keep debt around, the more interest you’ll have to pay. That’s basically money you could have kept and saved! According to Allen, it’s best to avoid&nbsp;paying just the minimum payment. “Creditors also look for you to use about 30 percent of your available credit, so work on paying those high credit card balances down,” she adds.<\/p><h2>06. Get a company match.<\/h2><p>Allen encourages taking advantage of a <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2014/03/finance-how-to-roll-over-your-401k\">401(k)<\/a>—and similar accounts such as 403(b) and 457(b)—if your company has one, especially if they offer a match. It can make a huge difference &nbsp;if you’re still in your twenties and thirties because&nbsp;you have more time to compound interest. “It will give you a great head start down the line,” she says.<\/p><h2>07. Have the ‘money talk’ with your partner.<\/h2><p>Whether or not we like to admit it, money can mess with relationships. A <em>Money <\/em>magazine survey found that <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/09/couples-therapy-arguing-about-money-marriage-relationships-finances\">70 percent of couples argue about money<\/a> over any other stressors.<em>&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/01/talking-about-money-with-your-partner-relationships\">Learn about your partner’s financial habits and goals<\/a>, especially if the relationship is serious. “If you’re committed for the long haul, your finances will affect each other and <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/03/buying-your-first-home\">your future<\/a>,”&nbsp;Allen says.<\/p><h2>08. Avoid spending temptation.<\/h2><p>To start, Allen suggests unsubscribing from emails and skipping lunch break window shopping. Reading a book or calling a friend can also distract you from shopping online. Here’s another tip: “Meet your friend at the park instead of Starbucks!”<\/p><h2>09. Celebrate small wins.<\/h2><p>Moderation in spending is still important, though. Allow yourself some “<a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/06/budget-saving-money-stress-personal-finance-guilt-spending-money\">just for fun<\/a>” money. After all, Allen reminds us that being overly strict is a recipe for burnout. Instead, reward yourself in reasonable and healthy ways. Opt for more adventures—such as concerts or mini road trips—instead of possessions; <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/12/161215143300.htm\">research proves that experiences are better than material things<\/a>.<\/p><h2>10. Look beyond money.<\/h2><p>Your financial health doesn’t stop at your wallet. “Do what it takes to <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2012/09/fitness-that-fits-your-body-is-a-gift\">take care of your body<\/a>, mind, career, and relationships,”&nbsp;Allen says. This includes being kind to yourself while you’re young. By doing so, you’ll be sure to feel rich in what matters most later on—your life.<\/p><p>Money problems and bad habits don’t just disappear; it takes work to be fiscally savvy. Now is the best time to take control of your finances—especially while you’re still young. Your future self will be glad you did.<\/p><p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"https://stock.adobe.com/\">Adobe

tml-version=\"2\" --><p>It’s just about that season again. Siblings are graduating.&nbsp;Parents are celebrating anniversaries.&nbsp;Friends are getting married and welcoming babies. Even <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/11/saving-money-social-life-finances-affordable-ways-to-socialize\">frugal girls are transforming into social butterflies<\/a>.<\/p><p>It’s an exciting time, but it’s also expensive—at least it <em>can <\/em>be if you’re not careful. Happily, there are ways to save wisely when your social calendar is filled with parties, presents, and your presence kindly requested. You don’t have to cut your relationships to cut your costs in the process—we promise!<\/p><h2>01. Know your money personality.<\/h2><p>Anticipate which budgeting problem you'll likely run into by learning your <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2017/04/money-problems-based-on-your-money-personalities\">money personality<\/a>. Being a risk taker or security seeker impacts how you're inclined to deal with your dollar bills during life's expensive stages. If you always say \"no\" because you assume you can't afford to attend a destination wedding, or you say \"yes\" to every get together because making memories is your cup of tea, knowing your money personality helps you figure out how to prioritize your social expenses wisely.<\/p><h2>02.&nbsp;Find out the celebrant’s love language.<\/h2><p>What savers and spenders want most out of celebrating milestones is showing the people we care about how much we love and support them. Just like investing in a <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2016/06/financial-planning-in-your-twenties-savings-personal-finance-how-to-budget\">401k<\/a>, you want your gift to yield the&nbsp;highest return with the lowest risk. Ensure your present (or presence) makes the most impact on the recipients by finding out which of the <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2013/04/dr-gary-chapman-explains-the-5-love-languages\">five love languages<\/a> makes them feel most loved. Then you’ll know whether your resources are best spent on a one-on-one spa date with your pregnant BFF (quality time) or planning her baby shower (an act of service). If you’re short on ideas, look to our <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/tag/gift-guide/\">gift guides for every love language<\/a>&nbsp;for inspiration.<\/p><h2>03. Learn how and when to regretfully decline.<\/h2><p>Take \"Your presence is a gift\" literally. It's <em>OK<\/em> to skip pre- and after-parties. Maybe you skip the wedding shower, so you can better afford the wedding. You’re not just saying no; you're saying yes to something else. Special occasions are not an excuse to spend carelessly (like offering to buy everyone and their mom a round of drinks). But if treating the wedding party to a bottle of single scotch double malt is important to you because your <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2017/04/money-problems-based-on-your-money-personalities\">money personality is the spender<\/a>,<em> <\/em><a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2013/04/dr-gary-chapman-explains-the-5-love-languages\">your love language is gift giving<\/a>, <em>and<\/em> it’s the last toast for the newlyweds, create a&nbsp;budget for this in advance and decline other expenses accordingly.<\/p><h2>04.&nbsp;Side hustle.<\/h2><p>There's always time to put aside a bit of extra cash, and summer is particularly ripe with opportunity. <a href=\"http://verilymag.com/2015/08/earning-extra-money-second-job-paying-off-college-debt-make-money-from-your-hobby\">Earn money by doing things you love<\/a>: cooking, photography, selling crafts on Etsy,&nbsp;freelance writing,&nbsp;nannying (the kids are out!), Lyft driving, renting extra space in your home on Airbnb, or whatever is your jam. With our app-driven sharing economy, the possibilities these days are literally endless.<\/p><h2>05. Cut travel costs.<\/h2><p>Carefully calculate your predicted expenses before you accept any invitation. If you <em>can<\/em>&nbsp;budget for travel, consider myriad ways to save. Stay with a friend. Share a car, room, or Airbnb with another guest.&nbsp;Use <a href=\"https://skiplagged.com/\">Skiplagged<\/a> to find the most affordable trip, including one-way flights, alternate airports, and signing up for fare alerts.&nbsp;Don’t check bags.&nbsp;Pack food for the road (avoid liquids in your carry-on). Look into free hotel shuttles to avoid cab fare, and when you arrive, ask the front desk if there is a discounted room available from someone else’s last-minute cancellation.<\/p><h2>06. Split the expenses.<\/h2><p>From a grad’s surprise party to a mini-babymoon fund for soon-to-be-parents, apps such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.splitwise.com/\">Splitwise<\/a> make splitting expenses easier than ever.&nbsp;Ask friends and family, \"I’m thinking of organizing a group present. You in?\" It’s a practical way to get a pricier gift or experience at a price point every participant can afford. Rather than choosing the gift first, ask each person to contribute what they are comfortable with and pick the present from there.<\/p><h2>07. Do it yourself.<\/h2><p>We don’t mean DIY your gift (unless you’re a Millennial Martha Stewart, of course).
