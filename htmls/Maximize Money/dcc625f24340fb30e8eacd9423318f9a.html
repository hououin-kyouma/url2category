        <p>Today, all of your money problems are going to be solved. I know — you're thrilled. But don't thank me; thank this woman who is offering <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ginarushton/people-are-screaming-over-this-womans-financial-advice?bffboz&amp;utm_term=.tmN317qvel#.tcBRo30gyK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advice for how to get out of debt</a> — and it's so simple, I can't believe we didn't think of it already: all you need to do is act like a rich person, avoid paying bills, and spend your money on silver spoons to stir your coffee. </p>
        <p>I can imagine this has rocked your world —&nbsp;along with the other 75 percent of <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/11/more-americans-are-debt-free-for-now.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans who have some kind of debt</a> — so I'll give you a moment to compose yourself before I go on. </p>
        <p>Simone Milasas is the founder of the Joy of Business, a company that (according to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/accessjoybusiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Facebook page</a>) offers "tools and processes, so you can look at business from a very different place." (If you don't quite understand what that means, well, it's OK because neither do I.) From what I gather, many of their viewpoints are based in the law of attraction, meaning that what you give is what you receive: if you have a positive relationship with money, you'll attract more. This is a wonderful perspective, so don't question the complete lack of logic you're about to encounter.</p>
        <p>Seriously. Ignore it completely.</p>

        <p>Grab a pen so you can write this down. </p>
        <h2>Tip #1: Don't Pay Your Bills First</h2>
        <p>Put away 10 percent of everything you earn, as <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ginarushton/people-are-screaming-over-this-womans-financial-advice?bffboz&amp;utm_term=.tmN317qvel#.tcBRo30gyK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"an honouring of you."</a> This is very important, because you should honor yourself <em>before </em>you honor your bills. Says Milasas, "... if you pay your bills first, you will always have more bills. When you pay the bills first, the universe says, 'Oh, okay. This person wishes to honour their bills. Let’s give them some more bills.' If you honour yourself by setting aside 10 per cent first, the universe says, 'Oh, they are willing to honour themselves. They are willing to have more,' and it responds to that. It gives you more." This is sound advice, people — particularly if you're part of the roughly 25 percent of Americans who are <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-05-20/quarter-american-adults-cant-pay-all-their-monthly-bills-44-have-less-400-cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not able to pay their bills</a> in full every month. </p>

        <p>To recap: honoring yourself is the priority — not honoring bills. Hopefully the following chapter covers what to do when you don't honor your electricity in time and it gets shut off. </p>
        <h2>Tip #2: Carry Money Like A Rich Person Would</h2>
        <p>Yes, even if it is totally out of your budget, carry around the amount of money that you think a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ginarushton/people-are-screaming-over-this-womans-financial-advice?bffboz&amp;utm_term=.tmN317qvel#.tcBRo30gyK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wealthy person would carry</a>. "I like to have at least $1,000 on me at all times," says Milasas, making life easier for every thief within a 25-mile-radius. So... might that be a little risky? Sure, she admits, but it's still a wise idea. Case in point: her friend who was mugged carrying $1,800 and was "much more willing to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1wOzr6eDUAhUT-GMKHa_2AvYQFgguMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bustle.com%2Farticles%2F118992-i-paid-off-my-52000-student-loan-in-under-a-year-by-moving-to-bali&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcAfrvH105U_DcwtEozbrwMAMCaQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">be aware of her money</a>" afterward. Ah, silver linings. </p>
        <p>While you might not carry cash on you anymore because you don't feel safe or because, oh, I don't know, a measly nine percent of <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/payment-method-statistics-1276.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans prefer paying in cash</a>, you might want to reconsider your ways: "If you <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ginarushton/people-are-screaming-over-this-womans-financial-advice?bffboz&amp;utm_term=.tmN317qvel#.tcBRo30gyK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid having money</a> on you or in your life because you think you will lose it or it will be stolen from you, you will never allow yourself to have money at all," she says. </p>

        <p>Takeaway? Carry lots of money on you. $1,000 if possible. If you don't have $1,000, honor yourself by telling your health insurance bill to eff off and the universe will probably throw a couple Benjamins your way.</p>
        <h2>Tip #3: Buys Lots Of Diamonds</h2>
        <p>So, do not pay bills first.

        <p>It was by using tactics like these that Milasas <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ginarushton/people-are-screaming-over-this-womans-financial-advice?bffboz&amp;utm_term=.tmN317qvel#.tcBRo30gyK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got out of nearly $200,000 in debt</a> — debt she wasn't "even cognitively sure" how she got into, as she told the <em>Good Day Colorado </em>breakfast show. "I would definitely go away on a weekend or buy a nice bottle of champagne." She must've been honoring herself a little too much. Or not enough. I don't know anymore.</p>
