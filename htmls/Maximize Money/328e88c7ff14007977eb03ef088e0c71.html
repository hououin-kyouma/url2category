MATT? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE HELPING YOU FACE YOUR  FINANCIAL FEARS THIS WEEK WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM SUZE ORMAN. ON WEDNESDAY, PEOPLE ON THE  PLAZA AND ONLINE OPENED UP ABOUT THEIR WORRIES OVER BILLS,  RETIREMENT AND MORE. SUZY GAVE THEM GREAT ADVISE AND  BEGAN GIVING AWAY A PERSONAL  ONLINE FINANCE COURSE FOR FREE. SO FAR, 130,000 STUDENTS AND  CLIMBING HAVE SIGNED UP. SHE'S BACK WITH US TODAY. HI, SUZE, GOOD MORNING. 130,000 IS. YOU TOUCHED A NERVE HERE. JUST FOR PEOPLE YOU WEREN'T  WATCHING, WHAT IS THE COURSE AND WHY ARE YOU GIVING IT AWAY FREE? WE'RE GIVING IT AWAY BECAUSE  IT'S A CHARITY. THE POPE IS SAYING, LET'S BE  CHARITABLE. IT IS YON KIPPUR. GIVING THIS EXTENSIVE COURSE  AWAY FOR FREE. EVERY PERSON CAN GET IT. THE RESPONSE WAS ENORMOUS  YESTERDAY, ESPECIALLY ON OUR  FACEBOOK PAGE. SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT STARTING TO SAVE. THIS ONE IS FROM KATE. I'M 33, SELF-EMPLOYED, STARTING  TO THINK ABOUT SAVINGS. I HAVE NO DEBT, AND I HOPE TO  BUY A HOME ONE DAY. I'VE NOT SET UP A RETIREMENT  ACCOUNT YET. SHOULD I FOCUS ON RETIREMENT,  SAVINGS OR SAVING FOR A HOME? YOU SHOULD BE DOING BOTH. MAYBE YOU'LL BUY A HOME ONE DAY  OR MAYBE OWE EYOU DON'T. YOU NEED MONEY IN RETIREMENT. YOU'RE YOUNG, AND THESE ARE YOUR COMPOUNDING YEARS. MAKE RETIREMENT THE NUMBER ONE  PRIORITY AND THEN A HOUSE. HERE'S ONE, I CAN'T WAIT TO  HEAR HOW YOU ANSWER THIS. JACKIE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT A  SPLURGE ITEM. I'D LOVE TO TAKE MY DAD FOR A  TRIP TO HAWAII FOR HIS 75th  BIRTHDAY. I HAVE NO SAVINGS AND WOULD PUT  IT ON A CREDIT CARD. WOULD IT BE CRAZY FOR ME TO DO  THIS? JACKIE, I'LL ANSWER THIS ONE  SIMPLY FOR YOU. SO CRAZY, I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU  WHY. YOU HAVE NO SAVINGS. SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU, WHO  ARE YOU GOING TO GO TO FOR HELP? YOUR PAPA. HE'S GOING TO THINK BACK TO, WHY WOULD JACKIE HAVE TAKEN ME TO  HAWAII? YOU WILL RUIN THE WHOLE THING. YOU REALLY WANT TO GIVE YOUR  PAPA SOMETHING FOR HIS 75th? GIVE HIM LOVE. WRITE HIM A LETTER AND TELL HIM  EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER FELT  ABOUT HIM. IT WON'T EVER GO. THE TRIP WILL. MEDICAL BILLS AND PRICES. HOW CAN I NEGOTIATE DOWN A VERY  HIGH HOSPITAL BILL TO SOMETHING  THAT I WILL ACTUALLY PAY OFF IN  MY LIFETIME? IF YOU WILL ACTUALLY PAY IT  OFF IN YOUR LIFETIME, MAKE SURE  THE HOSPITAL KNOWS THAT. GO TO THE HOSPITAL, WHOEVER YOU  CREATED THIS BILL WITH, AND TELL THEM, YOU CAN'T PAY IT IN A LUMP SUM, BUT THEY MOST LIKELY WILL  NEGOTIATE WITH YOU. PEOPLE DON'T THINK THEY WILL,  BUT THEY WILL. GO TO THEM AND TALK TO THEM. IS IT THAT SIMPLE? IT PROBABLY IS. WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS  ABOUT STUDENT LOANS. ONE REAL QUICK ONE. DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO GO INTO  STUDENT LOAN DEBT TODAY? MOST HAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS  IN DEBT AND END UP WITH A  MINIMAL JOB THAT DOESN'T LEAVE  MUCH LEFT TO PAY ON LOANS. YOU GET A STUDENT LOAN, DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT, BUT  DON'T TAKE OUT MORE OF A LOAN  THAN YOU'LL EARN IN THE FIRST  YEAR OUT OF WORK. IF IT'S MORE THAN THAT, YOU'LL  NEVER PAY IT OFF. NOTHING WRONG WITH GOING TO  COMMUNITY COLLEGE, PEOPLE, AND  NOT HAVING TO TAKE OUT A LOAN,  AT ALL, IF YOU ASK ME. SMART, PRACTICAL ADVICE. THANK YOU. DON'T FORGET, YOU CAN GET SUZE'S PERSONAL FINANCE COURSE AT  TODAY.COM. IT'S AVAILABLE FOR FREE UNTIL  TOMORROW AT 8:00 P.M.

She’s not only <a href="http://www.today.com/money/get-suze-ormans-new-personal-finance-online-course-free-through-t45636">giving away her Personal Finance Online Course for free</a> through Oct. 3, but she also joined TODAY for a recent Facebook chat to answer readers’ burning questions about everything from retirement and 529 plans to tackling student loan debt. </p>

        <h2>Student Loans</h2> 
        <p> <strong>Every time I'm able to put a little money in savings, something happens and I end up having to deplete my savings. How do I avoid that? I have no credit card debt, but am drowning in student loan debt. </strong> </p> 
        <p> <strong>Suze Orman:</strong> The most dangerous debt you can ever have is student loan debt because student loan debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. So I want you to change your attitude -- stop feeling like you're drowning in student loan debt and start feeling like you're swimming in the future of your life...and that your student loan debt allowed you to get there. Change your attitude and you'll see your financial life change, too. </p> 
        <p> <strong>I cannot pay my tuition and living expenses. Is there any way to lower or work off college debt? I am 58 years old. </strong> </p> 
        <p> You have to understand that student loan debt does not go away. They have the legal authority to garnish your social security check. So, you have got to get the word "can't" out of your vocabulary. You might want to think about getting a job at a non-profit organization because if you do, you then can pay back your student loan debt under the IBR method and after 10 years, it's totally forgiven. Then, at 68, if you want, you can claim full social security. No student loan payment + extra income from social security should help you a lot! </p> 
        <p> <strong>How do you pay Parent Plus loans off when you can't afford the payments? </strong> </p> 
        <p> I'm sorry to say to you — you should've thought about that before you took a parent plus loan. Because you are on the hook for those loans and there's absolutely no way for you to get around them. if you really can't afford to make payments on them, you are to ask your child who you took these loans out for to help you. They owe it to you to help pay for their college education. So, go ask them right now! </p>

WEATHER.COM ONLINE. SAVANNAH. ALL RIGHT. A THANK YOU SOME. WELL, ALL MORNING LONG PEOPLE  HERE ON PLAZA HAVE BEEN PINNING  A CIRCLE UNDERNEATH THEIR  BIGGEST FINANCIAL FEARS. WE GAVE THEM A FEW OPTIONS, AND  AS YOU CAN SEE AS THE MORNING  WORE OS INVESTMENT MISTAKES HAVE THE MOST AND AT TODAY.COM YOU  CAN SEE WHAT OUR SURVEY FOUND,  BEING AFRAID OF NEVER RETIRING  WAS THE TOP FEAR, ALSO FOLLOWED  BY UNABLE TO PAY BILLS,  INVESTMENT MISTAKES, PAYING FOR  COLLEGE AND LOSING HOMES. SO MONEY EXPERT SUZE ORMAN IS  HERE. SHE'S GOING TO HELP FOLKS, HELP  THEM REACH THEIR GOALS AN  OVERCOME THEIR FEARS AND HAS  SOMETHING EXCITING TO SHARE. SUZY, GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING, MY DEAR. IT'S VERY TELLING TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF. THIS ORIGINAL BOARD REALLY PUTS  IT CLEARLY. A LOT OF RETIREMENT FEARS THAT  PEOPLE HAVE. YEAH, AND AS YOU LOOK AT THIS WHAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST  SERIOUSLY WAS ONLY ONE PERSON,  LOOK AT THIS. ONE PERSON IS AFRAID OF LOSING  THEIR HOME. WELL, WE'RE GOING TO GO  THROUGH SOME OF THESE ITEMS AND  WHAT YOU CAN DO TO ASSUAGE THOSE FEARS, BUT FIRST OF ALL I WANT  TO GET TO THE MOST EXCITING NEWS WHICH IS YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING  WONDERFUL FOR PEOPLE. YOU'RE GIVING AWAY AN ONLINE  COURSE. TELL ME ABOUT THIS. THE ONLY WAY, EVERYBODY, TO  GET OVER FEAR, RIGHT, IS TO TAKE ACTION BUT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT TO  DO SO I HAVE CREATED A NEW  PERSONAL FINANCE ONLINE COURSE,  VIDEOS OF ME, EVERYTHING THAT  YOU CAN READ AND GUESS WHAT,  IT'S FREE TODAY AND TOMORROW. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO TO  TODAY.COM, GIFT CODE IS TODAY  AND IT'S YOURS FOREVER. ANY UPDATES, THAT KIND OF  THING, BUT NOT GOING TO BE FREE  FOREVER. IF YOU DON'T GO IN THE NEXT  COUPLE OF DAYS EVENTUALLY -- IT WILL GO ON SALE FOR A LOT  OF MONEY SO THIS IS THE TIME TO  DO IT AND GET IN NOW AND YOU'LL  NEVER HAVE TO PAY FOR ANYTHING  AGAIN WITH IT. YOU SAY SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THE BOOK THAT THIS INTERNAL  FEAR IS ONE OF THE GREATEST  OBSTACLES TO SOMEONE'S PERSONAL  WEALTH. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT. FEAR IS AN INTERNAL EMOTION,  AND WHEN ARE YOU A FRAYED, YOU  BUY AT THE WRONG TIME, YOU SELL  AT THE WRONG TIME. EVERYTHING YOU DO IS WRONG SO  THE ONLY WAY, LIKE I SAID, TO  GET RID OF YOUR FEAR IS TO TAKE  ACTION AND KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO  IT ON YOUR OWN. LET'S GET SPECIFIC HERE. ONE OF THE FEARS THAT PEOPLE  TALK ABOUT, BEING UNABLE TO PAY  THE BILLS. THE AVERAGE U.S. HOUSEHOLD  CREDIT CARD DEBT, 15,7056. CREDIT CARDS, STUDENT LOAN DEBT. WHEN PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY ARE  IN THIS BIG FINANCIAL HOLE  WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE? THE ADVICE IS YOU HAVE TO  FACE IT TO ERASE IT. WHEN YOU HAVE CREDIT CARD DEBT  MOST LIKELY YOU WANT PEOPLE TO  THINK YOU HAVE MORE MONEY,  YOU'RE SPENDING MONEY YOU DON'T  HAVE, SO START TELLING  EVERYBODY, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I  HAVE $15,000 OF CREDIT CARD  DEBT, I HAVE $20,000 OF CREDIT  CARD DEBT. AS SOON AS PEOPLE KNOW YOU HAVE  CREDIT CARD DEBT YOU'LL TEND NOT TO SPEND AS MUCH MONEY ON YOUR  CREDIT CARDS. SO KIND OF BEING OPEN ABOUT  IT, ACCOUNTABILITY, IS THAT THE  CONCEPT? OTHER WISE I CAN SAY PAY THE  LOWEST INTEREST RATE. NO, START TELLING EVERYBODY HOW  MUCH CREDIT CARD DEBT YOU HAVE,  PEOPLE. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. GET REAL, PEOPLE. ANOTHER FEAR PEOPLE NOT BEING  ABLE TO RETIRE. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HAS LESS  THAN $60,000 SAVED WHICH SOUNDS  LIKE A LOT BUT NOT WHEN YOU'RE  TALKING ABOUT RETIREMENT AND  PEOPLE LIVING LONGER. YEAH. MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SPEND  MORE YEARS IN RETIREMENT THAN  THEY EVER DID WORKING. WHICH IS INCREDIBLE. THINKING ABOUT IT. MY MOMMA LIVED TO 972, SO IF  YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALIVE, 85, 90 YEARS OF AGE YOU NEED MONEY IN  RETIREMENT. THE BEST WAY TO DO IT, TO PLAY  CATCHUP IS GET RID OF YOUR  EXPERIENCES. LOWER YOUR EXPENSES, PAY OFF  YOUR MORTGAGE, GET RID OF DEBT  SO YOU DON'T NEED AS MUCH MONEY  TO GENERATE INCOME FOR YOURSELF. QUESTIONS OUT ON THE PLAZA. LET'S GO TO KIANA TURNING 25  TODAY.

        <p> <strong>Can you explain the student loan strategy you mentioned on air earlier today? [see the segment above] </strong> </p> 
        <p> Kyana, who was on the TODAY Show this morning had $40,000 of a student loan that she was paying back $150 a month under the IBR or Income Based Repayment Program. Under the standard repayment method, her payments, on a $40,000 loan would be about $400 a month. So, what's happening to her is that the $250 less per month that she is paying on IBR from the standard method is being put on the back of her loan. Her loan + interest is growing rather than decreasing. In 20 years, when her loan will be forgiven, she will have approx. $80,000 of student loan debt forgiven because it's grown. She is going to owe ordinary income taxes on the entire $80,000 that year. She is far better off simply paying an extra $250 a month now that she can afford, so that in 10 years her loan is paid off and she doesn't have to worry about income taxes. The only people who should ever do an IBR student loan are those that work for a non-profit place of employment. For after 10 years, their loan is forgiven, and they do not owe income tax on it. Big difference for someone that works in the public sector like Kyana does! </p> 
        <p> <a href="http://www.today.com/money/suze-orman-dont-give-your-kids-allowance-other-money-tips-t44001"><strong>RELATED: Suze Orman: 'Don't give your kids an allowance' and other money tips for parents</strong></a> </p> 
        <p> <strong>We have several student loan companies. How do we consolidate and what company do you recommend? Should be combine both mine and my husband’s? </strong> </p> 
        <p> You should NEVER EVER combine your student loan with your husband's! You are to keep that as separate as can be! Are you kidding me!? </p> 
        <h2>Other Debt</h2> 
        <p> <strong>How do I determine which credit card to pay off first? Should it be the one with the least balance and work my way to all others? Facing credit card debt can be overwhelming, but I want to pay them all off. </strong> </p> 
        <p> Add up all your minimum payments that are due. Add 20% to that figure. So, let's say you owe $300 a month for the minimum payment due for all your credit cards — 20% of that is $60. You are to pay the minimum payment due this month every month from now on, even if the min. payment due next month is less. You are to add that $60 to the highest interest rate card you are paying. When that card is paid off, you take that entire amount plus that $60 and you add it to the second highest interest rate card that you are currently paying. Keep rolling down like that. In my new online course, it will show you exactly how to do it. So, make sure you download it now! </p> 
        <div class="widget newsvinelargepoll"> 
         <div class="j_content_poll" data-poll-id="60231" data-is-wide-poll="true"></div> 
        </div> 
        <p> <strong>I have credit card debt about $15,000. Should I pay it off by taking money out of my trust or get a loan from a bank or credit union? </strong> </p> 
        <p> No! Don't do any of that. Why don't you just simply do a balance transfer to a credit card at a 0% interest rate for 21 months? Really start focusing on paying it off every single month. </p> 
        <p> <strong>I have always been told, "Don't close a credit card with all that good history." But which is better or worse on the credit score: having open thousands in a lines of credit or keep that good history? I have a lot of good history in other areas of my credit report too. I am just trying to slim down my debt and credit to make it more manageable. </strong> </p> 
        <p> History only accounts for 10% of your FICO score. 30% of your FICO score is made up of your debt to credit limit ratio, which essentially means how much you owe on all your credit cards in comparison to the credit limit that you have on all your cards. So, closing down your credit cards is the worst thing you can possibly do! Once you've paid off a credit card, just cut it up, but don't close it down! This, of course, assumes you're not paying an annual charge for these credit cards. If you are, that's reason enough to close that credit card down. It makes no sense to keep any of your credit cards at department stores open. </p> 
        <h2>Retirement</h2> 
        <p> <strong>I am taking early retirement next year because it is a defined benefit and I am concerned the company might change it to a 401k. My plan is more than others at the company because it has a cost-of-living increase. I have no credit card debt, only five years left to pay off my mortgage. I am scared [that] it’s not enough, but I know i can get by. I also have the opportunity to work for other companies, just not as much income, but a friendlier and honest environment. Is my plan for no debt and happy life worth it? </strong> </p> 
        <p> How do you have a happy life if you quit and you're scared to death?! When operating from fear, you will ALWAYS make financial mistakes! Are you sure if they take the defined benefit away next year that you'll lose it? I don't think so! They're not going to just give it to new employees. Check it out more carefully, but as long as you're afraid to do something, it's better to do nothing than something that scares you. </p> 
        <p> <a href="http://www.today.com/money/suze-orman-youll-spend-more-retirement-you-do-now-heres-t44596"><strong>RELATED: Suze Orman: You'll spend more in retirement than you do now</strong></a> </p> 
        <p> <strong>I am 59 years old and am a widow. I am presently unemployed. My husband did not have a pension. I have no mortgage but am lacking an income. Should I take my husbands Social Security at a reduced rate when I turn age 60? I have a small pension but would make no sense to take that too early. I have some stock and receive dividends. What is your advice for me? I have been trying to get a job for over a year now with no luck. I have no medical insurance and am too young for Medicare. </strong> </p> 
        <p> If your social security (when you turn full retirement age) is larger than his reduced amount now, then I would take his reduced amount now to help you get by. When you turn 66 or 67, switch to yours. if you're really struggling that much, you might want to consider selling your home and moving some place where you can afford to buy something that's far less than where you're living now -- where you would be able to afford making your payments and getting health insurance. </p> 
        <h2>Investing</h2> 
        <p> <strong>Best investment I can put money into? </strong> </p> 
        <p> The best investment is you! If you have any credit card debt, car loan debt, student loan debt, that should all be paid off before you make an investment. It goes without saying, however, if you work for an employer that has a 401K that matches, that is the best place to put your money. </p> 
        <p> <strong>What do you think about 529 accounts for young children? </strong> </p> 
        <p> LOVE them! Go to <a href="http://savingsforcollege.com/">savingsforcollege.com</a>. It is the website by Joseph Hurley — he is the nation's expert on 529 plans. </p> 
        <p> <strong>What is the best account to start for a child? Should we look for ones that gain most money? </strong> </p> 
        <p> The best account for a child is a 529 plan. Be very careful of [Uniform Gifts to Minors Act] UGMA accounts. For any money in a UGMA account is counted again the child's eligibility for financial aid. 529s are the way to go! </p> 
        <p> <strong>How should I save money for my son’s college? Was wondering if you recommend the 529NY saves plan? And are there penalties on it when taken out? </strong> </p> 
        <p> No penalties, no taxes! As long as it's used for the child's education. </p> 
        <p> <strong>We are a single family income and we have a 6-year-old. I am worried that we aren't able to save for his college yet. If we could find $20-$50/month to put away where would be the best place to put it? </strong> </p> 
        <p> From the sounds of it, you should get life insurance to protect this child if something happened to you or your spouse if you're married. You also need a living, revocable trust, because minors can't inherit money. Please make sure you have protected them in every possible way if something were to go wrong. If you've done everything to protect them, use a 529 plan! </p> 
        <p> <strong>What are some good strategies for investing with my Roth other than stocks? </strong> </p> 
        <p> With a Roth IRA at a discount brokerage firm, you could buy individual bonds and/or any investment that they may offer. But at this point in time, stocks, especially those that pay a nice dividend and it's a good company — it's a great way to go. </p> 
        <p> <strong>In this up and down market, what would a moderate risk level diverse portfolio look like? </strong> </p> 
        <p> It would absolutely have dividend paying stocks in it to curve the bite of a down turning market. For at least, you're getting income while the market is on this roller coaster ride! </p> 
        <p> <strong>What do you think about trading exchange-traded funds (ETFs)? Isn't it a good way to make some quick bucks? </strong> </p> 
        <p> No! Trading anything is never a good way to make quick bucks. True wealth is built over acquiring a large position of stock in great companies. </p> 
        <p> <strong>I'm in my forties and would like to retire in about 15 years. I have been contributing to my 401k since I was in my twenties. Should I keep my investments in high risk or lower risk? </strong> </p> 
        <p> Keep investments in high risk. </p> 
        <p> <strong>My 27-year-old kid just got a "real" job as a Union carpenter. With that job comes an annuity. How much should he be putting into that annuity weekly? </strong> </p> 
        <p> I would only be putting money into the annuity if they match his contribution. Otherwise, he is far better off doing his own individual Roth IRA where he can max out at $5,500 a year. If they do match his contribution, he should only contribute up to the point of the match, and then take any extra money and put that toward any student loan debt he may have, credit card debt he may have OR an emergency fund! </p> 
        <p> <strong>I have a substantial amount in my 401k from previous company. Do I leave it with the current investment group? If not, where should I move it? I have a new job and have several years still to work? </strong> </p> 
        <p> I would do an IRA rollover with it. At any major discount brokerage firm. Invest it in either exchange traded funds, index funds or dividend paying stocks. But I would do so on a dollar cost averaging basis. Do not invest lump sum now. </p> 
        <p> <strong>My 24-year-old daughter has a 401/403 with her job [that she’s] been at six years. She is student in school quitting her job in a month so she can do school full time. What is the best thing she can do with her money in 401k/ 403b when she quits? </strong> </p> 
        <p> When she quits, do an IRA rollover with it at a major discount brokerage program. Invest it. See answer above for more info. </p>

YOU HAVE COME TO THE RIGHT  PLACE. THAT IS RIGHT, A PERSONAL  ONLINE FINANCO  YOU TO MANAGE THE MONEY AND THE  WOMAN WHO IS GIVING IT ALL AWAY  IS FINANCIAL EXPERT SUZE ORMAN. SO NICE AND HERE TO TELL US  ABOUT IT AND TACKLE YOUR  QUESTIONS ABOUT BUYING A HOUSE,  AND SAVING FOR RETIREMENT AND  PAYING OFF ALL OF THE DEBT THAT  YOU HAVE ACCUMULATED. SO THIS IS A $63,000 VALUE  THAT YOU ARE GIVING AWAY. HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING  THAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT  THE MONEY AND THEY DON'T HAVE  ANY PLACE TO GO ON THE REGULAR  BASIS. OR THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. YOU CAN'T BUY IT, AND THE  ONLY PLACE TO GET IT IS RIGHT  HERE. SO THEY AND THEY THE CAN DOWNLOAD IT FOR FR FREE. AND IN TIME, WE WILL DEVELOP IT, AND GET A B  P WHDOWNLOAD IT FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS, THAT I WILL GET IT FOR  FREE. AND UNTIL FRIDAY. YES, FRIDAY AT 8:00 P.M., AND THEN IT IS YOURS FOREVER, ANDT  IS NOT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT U  YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT -- IT IS  YOURS FOREVER. AND YOU HAVE 43,000 PEOPLE  SIGNING UP FOR IT FOREVER. YES. AND GO THROUGH IT AGAIN. ALL RIGHT. HERE IS A QUESTION FROM THE  VIEWER SS AND THIS IS EMILY WHO  WANTS TO BUY A HOME. WOF YEAR, AND PEOPLE LLEA SAY THAT I SHOULD BUY A HOUSE  INSTEAD OF DUMPING $1,300 INTO  RENT EVERY MONTH. WHAT CRITERIA DO YOU THINK THAT  I SHOULD HAVE? WELL, YOU SHOULD BUY A HOME,  EMILY, BA YOUZ WANT TO BUY A  HOME, AND NOT BECAUSE OTHER  PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU SHOULD. YOU NEED A SECURE JOB TO PAY FOR IT, AND YOU NEED A FIXED RATE  MORTGAGE. 15 OR 30? IF YOU CAN AFFORD 15, GO 30,  BECAUSE YOU YOUNG, AND FIXED  RATE AND AT LEAST 20% DOWN, AN  EIGHT-MONTH EMERGENCY FUND  BESIDES THE 20% DOWN, AND YOU  NEED TO AFFORD THE PROPERTY  TAXES, AND THE INSURANCE, AND IF YOU CAN AFFORD ALL OF THAT AND  YOU KNOW IT, GO AHEAD. BUT YOU HAE T DT, CAEENIY NN HOME, AND BE  CAREFUL, GIRLFRIEND. AND WE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE  SHE IS CALLING FOR, BECAUSE IT  IS SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE IN  OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, AND  JUST ONE YEAR OUT OF COLLEGE. AND HERE IS THING, PEOPLE  SAY, $1,300 IN MONTH IN RENT AND I CAN AFFORD A $1,300 A MONTH  MORTGAGE, NO. IF YOU PAY $1,300 A MONTH  MORTGAGE, IT IS GOING TO BE  ABOUT $2,000 WITH INSURANCE AND  MAINTENANCE. BIG DIFFERENCE. AND HERE IS FARRA SAVING FOR  RETIME. I MAKE $5,000 A MONTH, AND  RERETIREMENT IS TO SET ASIDE  $6,500 TO HAVE THE SAME  LIFESTYLE, AND I PUTS A SIDE THE SAME AMOUNT AS MY COMPANY. AND WHY DON'T YOU INSTEAD OF  HAVING A MORTGAGE, PAY OFF THE  MORTGAGE, AND THE LARGEST  EXPENSE YOU IS THE MORTGAGE  PAYMENT, AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE  THAT, THEN YOU DON'T NEED AS  MUCH, AND PAY DOWN THE DEBT AND  PAY DOWN EXPENSE, AND THAT IS  THE NEXT THING THAT YOU NEED TO  DO TO CATCH UP. AND IS ISN'T THERE A TAX  REASON TO KEEP PART OF THE  MORTGAGE. YOU WOULD THINK SO, BUT IN  TENDING YEARS OF THE MORTGAGE,  THERE IS NO WRITE-OFF ANYMORE,  BECAUSE THE BANKS WANT ALL OF  THE MONEY UP FRONT, AND SO THEY  CHR YOU THE INTEREST UP  FRONT, AND THEN IN THE ENDING  YEARS, YOU ARE PAYING ALL OF T PRIP AND SO THAT WAY, IF YOU SELL THE HOUSE, THEY HAVE THEIR MONEY  ANYW ANYWAY, AND AFTER THE FIRST 7 TO THE 10 , TRULY A  SHAME. AND TIFFANY WANTS TO ASK THIS ABOUT DEBT. I KNOW YOU SAID TO LEAVE YOUR  RETIREMENT ALONE, AND WHAT IF  YOU ARE DROWNING IN DEBT AND IT  IS ENOUGH TO PAY OFF ALL OF YOUR CREDIT CARD DEBT AND STUDENT  LOAN DEBT. WELL, NO, TIFFANY, YOU ARE  NOT OLD ENOUGH TO DRAW IT  PENALTY TAX-E FREE AND IF YOU  OWE $100,000, YOU HAVE TO  WITHDRAW $200,000, BECAUSE YOU  WILL PAY ORDINARY INCOME TAX AND A PENALTY, GIVE ME A BREAK. LEAVE IT ALONE AND LET IT GROW  AND FIGURE OUT WAYS TO GET A  LOW-INTEREST RATE ON THE WAYS  THAT YOU HAVE THE CREDIT CARDS  AND IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF THE  STUDENT LOAN DEBT, TRANSFER IT  TO THE ZERO% CREDIT CARD AND  THERE ARE WAYS TO TACKLE THE  DEBT WITHOUT TOUCHING THE  RETIREMENT, GIRLFRIEND. AND LISTEN TO MAMA, AND WHO  DOESN'T. AND HERE IS THE ONE FROML WHAT SHOULD A YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WITH A 401(K) DO TO INVEST AND  SAVE MORE? BESIDES THE 401(K), YOU CAN  HAVE A IRA OR A ROTH ASHGS RA  AND HOPEFULLY A ROTH 401(K) AND  NOT A TRIGS DAL 401(K), BECAUSE  YOU WANT TO TAKE THE MONEY OUT  LATER IN LIFE TAX-FREE, AND SO  OPEN UP A ROTHIRA AS WELL IF YOU QUALIFY AND INVEST THAT WAY. SUZY, AWESOME, AND WE DON'T  HAVE TIME FOR ANYMORE, BUT YOU  CAN DOWNLOAD SUZY'S DEAL AND GO  TO TODAY.O AND IT IS A FREE  FINANCIAL COURSE FREE UNTIL  FRIDAY AT 5:00 P.M. EASTERN. AND GO TO KLG AND HODA THE -- K  LSHL&quot;,&quot;availabilityState&quot;:&quot;available&quot;}" data-mpxid="530862147974" data-video-state="available" vilynx-id="https://www.today.com/video/suze-orman-on-how-to-buy-a-home-save-for-retirement-530862147974">
